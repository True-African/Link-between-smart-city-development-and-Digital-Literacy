The on-going changes of the school library programs and services not only fit for the educational needs of the digital generation but also echo the development of Hong Kong as a smart city. Starting from the proposal of transformation Kowloon East into a Smart City District in the 2015 Policy Address and consolidating with “The Smart City Blueprint for Hong Kong” in 2017, Hong Kong is ready to be a smart society. This paper will report the capacity of the Teacher-Librarian on coordinating the valuable resources within and outside the school on subsequently facilitating “equal and free access to information and knowledge” (IFLA Global Vision 2018 highlights) of different school stakeholders in addition to improving students’ engagement in learning. It focuses specifically on the digital tool adoption and online resources which have profoundly transformed students’ Reading to Learn performance, teachers’ professional development and parent education in a short period of time. To name a few, students were introduced to the Google-connected world, eBook creation with online tools, Makerspace as well as STEM collections with OR code on each book to access related video. Teachers were especially alert to the critical issues of cyber safety and cyber ethics. Parents were guided to see the new world of the 4th Industrial Revolution and the Reading to Learn needs of their children through school library newsletters, circulars, and parent education seminar series. Other than surveys, interviews, and observations were used to find out what the small digital natives’ value and how they could engage in their Reading to Learn. The desirable results reinforce the collaborative efforts of the Teacher-Librarian, teachers, and parents. The synergy among different school stakeholders is crucial for fostering students’ digital literacy. Other than the Information and Communication Technology facilities and devices provided in the school, continued efforts on parent education upon the changing needs of their children on digital literacy, such as using new devices and gadgets to access various resources at home, are necessary for success. The positive impact of the school library’s digital transformation was widely disseminated to the public, educators and practitioners of the field through the Teaching and Learning Expo, Knowledge Exchange Seminar, Master of Science in Library and Information Management courses of the University of Hong Kong, Seed Project Sharing of the Education Bureau as well as posted on the Curriculum Development website of the Education Bureau in Hong Kong.

",2023,Towards Practice-oriented Framework for Digital Inequality in Smart Cities,"Digital equality, entailing access to the Internet and digital devices as well as a set of diverse digital skills, has been recognized as a crucial factor in the creation of just and sustainable smart cities. However, there remains gaps between smart city research and studies focusing on socio-digital inequalities and digital literacy. The aim of this article is two-fold: first, it explores the focal intersections of smart city development, socio-digital inequalities and digital literacy based on literature. Secondly, through an interdisciplinary exploration it aims to demonstrate that there is a need to align the current understanding of digital inequality with the conceptualizations of ‘smart citizenship’ which underline competencies related to critical thinking and resistance. For this purpose, we formulate a tentative, practice-oriented framework for understanding digital inequality in the context of smart cities. The framework is based on previous prominent definitions of digital inequality and digital literacy, but it intends to open new horizons for solutions and services that would increase peoples’ awareness on societal dimensions of digital technologies, and eventually, their digital agency. For the most part, the paper is theoretical, but it also draws examples from the research fieldwork conducted in Barcelona, Spain. Barcelona has been highlighted as one of the rare examples of a city that intends to center people in its smart city policies: We explore how Barcelona approaches the people-centric smart city in practice and introduce Canòdrom, a center for city inhabitants promoting open technologies, participatory democracy, and digital culture.","Towards Practice-oriented Framework for Digital Inequality in Smart CitiesDigital equality, entailing access to the Internet and digital devices as well as a set of diverse digital skills, has been recognized as a crucial factor in the creation of just and sustainable smart cities.

These policies are indicative of a digitized urban condition, where social and economic exchange rely on globalized telecommunications networks, and governance strategies follow suit. Propelled through events such as IBM’s Smarter Cities Challenge, the smart city acts as a data-driven logic urban change where widespread benefit to a city and its residents is proposed, masking the utility of these policies to further entrepreneurial economic development strategies. In this article, I present a case study of the Digital On-Ramps initiative that emerged from IBM’s policy-consultation in Philadelphia. The initiative proposed a social media-style workforce education application (app) to train up to 500,000 low-literacy residents for jobs in the information and knowledge economy, but even as the city’s mayor declared the project a success, it did not meet expectations. This essay argues that the rhetoric of intelligent, transformative digital change works much more to “sell” a city in the global economy than to actually address urban inequalities.","The empty rhetoric of the smart city: from digital inclusion to economic promotion in PhiladelphiaSmart city initiatives have been adopted by cities worldwide, proposing forward-looking, technological solutions to urban problems big and small.

The program requires ongoing investment in information technology infrastructure and training for civil servants, as well as increased participation from various government agencies and the public. The product evaluation results show improved government transparency and accountability, making it easier for the public to access public services and government policy information. The evaluation using the Kirkpatrick model shows positive results at every evaluation level, with users providing positive feedback on e-government services, increased understanding, adoption of digital services, and significant long-term impacts on operational efficiency, transparency, and public satisfaction. However, this study also identifies challenges that need to be addressed, such as technology infrastructure gaps, digital literacy among the public, and data security and privacy issues. Addressing these challenges will optimize the implementation of E-Government in DKI Jakarta and support the government's vision of an efficient, inclusive, and responsive Smart City.","EVALUATING IMPLEMENTATION OF E-GOVERNMENT PUBLIC SERVICES IN DKI JAKARTA TOWARDS A SMART CITY USING THE CIPP AND KIRKPATRICK EVALUATION MODELThis study evaluates the implementation of the E-Government program in DKI Jakarta using the CIPP (Context, Input, Process, Product) evaluation model and the Kirkpatrick model.

There are two main factors that are holding back digital consumption: insufficiency of digital competence and the age factor. According to experts, there are 7 types of cities in Russia, determined by the abundance of local digital services - from total inaccessibility to total sophistication. Thus, digitalization of Russians is uneven - along with rapid development of “smart cities”, the implementation of digital services into smaller cities is difficult and unequal.","Consumer’s Digital Literacy as a Condition of IT-Services Development in Russia IT services development requires considering characteristics of the target audience.

Specifically, we examine six cities—Amsterdam, Singapore, New York, Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen—through text collection and analysis. This study reveals three key findings. First, the urban features of each city, especially the relationship between the land and population, significantly impact the direction and design of smart mobility development. Second, while the development of smart mobility systems in various cities shows similarities, specific differences still exist. Third, the contrast in governance patterns between Chinese and non-Chinese cities lies in the government’s role. This kind of difference also differs from one Chinese city to another, especially in the relationship between the local government and relevant businesses.

",2021,The right to the city and data protection for developing citizen-centric digital cities,"ABSTRACT Smart city urban development seems inevitable for the future of our cities, but who should decide what that future should be like and whose interest’s smart urbanism serves? The ‘Right to the City’ calls for citizens as ‘users’ of cities to be integral parts to the socio-technological processes that shape urban space. This article explores how citizens can participate meaningfully, and whether data protection rights can be instrumental to this objective. It does so by analysing several smart city projects in Belgium and the Netherlands that were affected by the GDPR. The findings illustrate that data protection impacts smart city developments, but meaningful influence of citizens, as in the Right to the City, remains very limited. The article argues that already dominant actors and decision-makers remain in control of ‘smart’ urban developments, while citizens often lack awareness and data literacy. We suggest that participatory methods for city-making are valuable if they bring about small, incremental changes and that researchers can play an active role in lowering barriers to meaningful participation in practice.","The right to the city and data protection for developing citizen-centric digital citiesABSTRACT Smart city urban development seems inevitable for the future of our cities, but who should decide what that future should be like and whose interest’s smart urbanism serves?

An Analysis of Institutional and Individual Conditions for a New Concept of Smart Development of Ageing Communities,"In the face of the dynamic ageing of local communities, smart cities and smart villages programs should seek to ensure meeting the needs of the elderly and promoting solutions tailored to their computer literacy, digital skills, and perception capabilities. In this context we propose to approach local smart and age-friendly communities initiatives in a way that would provide responses to two contemporary megatrends: digitalization and demographic transition. We assumed that the deployment of such initiatives in local planning and governance depends on at least two conditions: demand for smart everyday products and services represented by older adults and the perspective of the local decision-makers. The paper aims to examine whether the smart city/smart village idea focused on meeting the needs of the elderly and seeking to shape age-friendly local communities and the environment could be implemented in the municipalities in Poland. The analysis of the elderly Poles’ capabilities to absorb the ICT solutions demonstrated that the smart and age-friendly community approach may face implementation difficulties, especially in the oldest groups of the Polish rural population. Results of the quantitative study conducted in 1236 municipalities revealed that local authorities perceive local policy goals, such as pursuing smart and age-friendly development as low priority ones. A citizen-centered approach of village heads and mayors to the local policy is critical for integrating these two priorities of being smart and age-friendly.","Smart and Age-Friendly Communities in Poland.

The paper aims to examine whether the smart city/smart village idea focused on meeting the needs of the elderly and seeking to shape age-friendly local communities and the environment could be implemented in the municipalities in Poland. The analysis of the elderly Poles’ capabilities to absorb the ICT solutions demonstrated that the smart and age-friendly community approach may face implementation difficulties, especially in the oldest groups of the Polish rural population. Results of the quantitative study conducted in  municipalities revealed that local authorities perceive local policy goals, such as pursuing smart and age-friendly development as low priority ones. A citizen-centered approach of village heads and mayors to the local policy is critical for integrating these two priorities of being smart and age-friendly.",1

Taking into account that spreading of ICTs (digitalization) plays an important role in laying the foundation for smart solutions’ development and usage, we have also provided an overview of this process in Ukraine and compared Ukraine’s positions on the global arena. To do this, we have used a number of international indexes (ICT Development Index, Networked Readiness Index, Global Innovation Index, E-Government Development Index, E-Participation Index) to show an objective picture and to cover as many aspects as possible (ICT readiness, ICT usage, ICT skills, and other features build on top of these). Lack of the required infrastructure and equal proper access to ICTs within the country is one of the major issues Ukraine has to deal with right now. We have also compared current positions of Ukraine against the target values specified in the Strategy of Information Society Development of Ukraine-2020. The research is based on the method of theoretical, logical, and systematic analysis of the literature (articles, strategies and agendas, international indexes etc.) along with the methods of comparative analysis that allow comparing smart solutions among the selected cities. We have composed a comparison table for successful smart solutions available currently in Ukraine for the selected cities (Kyiv, Lviv, Kharkiv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Vinnytsia, Dnipro) within different areas. We have also conducted a SWOT-analysis to reveal strong and weak points for the further concept development, as well as the possible consequences and risks. The article suggests the steps for further successful development of smart city concept in Ukraine. These steps should encourage the dialogue on the topic within our country. We believe that cooperation of all stakeholders on the national level is necessary to 1) Establish a common platform for sharing best practices and spreading successful solutions faster; 2) Develop a measurement tool to compare both the progress among different cities and the progress for the specific city within some time period. While locally each city should work on its own Smart City Agenda and Roadmap, ensuring the interests of all groups is taken into account. But of course, active dialogue on both city and national levels, as well as within the axis Government – Industry – University – Civil Society is a core component of smart city building process.","DIGITALIZATION PROCESS IN UKRAINE AS A PREREQUISITE FOR THE SMART CITY CONCEPT DEVELOPMENTThe paper aims to review Smart city building process in Ukraine, its successful examples, and possible drawbacks on the way and based on this suggests the steps country should undertake for the future development of this concept.

A major body of literature has been dedicated to characterizing the structure of the networks formed by roads, buildings, landmarks, and other elements in urban environments. While most research in the field is dedicated to centrality, connectivity and integration, previous studies were focused on physical separation as the feature that best expresses socioeconomic segregation. This study adds a global layer to the local barriers, developing a ‘theory of smart city form’: urban networks that connect the far and separate the near, eliminate physical distance yet leave physical traces. Significant shifts are occurring in both global and the local processes associated with morphological separation within cities and information flow between cities. Smart cities, global citizens, and urban networks materialize a global regime of competition and innovation that tends to overwhelm local processes of socioeconomic integration and social mobility. Beyond the digital divide and digital literacy, new ecosystems of software development lead innovation in ways that connect the similar while neglecting distance and excluding closer but dissimilar social groups. The establishment of two layers of reference, the local and the global, aligns with the impact of technological progress on the generic city and helps to specify the origins of separability, and the persistence of segregation and displacement. Global connectivity is outward-interconnected but inward-disconnecting. This paper reviews findings to identify this anomaly in global cities and concludes with a theoretical review to frame the proposed explanation for sharp divides in closer proximity.

",2022,On data cultures and the prehistories of smart urbanism in “Africa’s Digital City”,"ABSTRACT Data is variably imagined and practiced according to values, behaviors, and norms fashioned over an extended temporal register, meaning data initiatives are not only influenced by contemporary technological and structural conditions, but also by the forces of history and culture. This claim is advanced by situating Cape Town’s smart city plans in a national historical context, highlighting how desires to be a “global city” driven by data, evidence, and openness come up against a data culture largely incompatible with these goals. A genealogy of South Africa’s politicized history of recordkeeping, biometrics, databases, and information sharing reveals the roots and legacy of an ambivalent data culture, which poses a considerable challenge to today’s data ambitions. Through this example, the paper makes two contributions to critical understandings of urban data. First, it advances the notion of data cultures – the values, behaviors, and norms ascribed to data by groups or organizations that together shape practices of data collection, management, use, and sharing. Second, it draws attention to the multi-scalar production of smart cities, when global data imaginaries meet national-scale characteristics at local places.

",2020,Smart Cities as Large Technological Systems: Collective Action Problems as Organizational Barriers to Urban Digital Transformation,"In a race to develop ‘smart cities’, policymakers in metropolitan regions across the world are rapidly deploying IoT devices, sensors, and emerging ICTs, including AI and facial recognition to solve various urban governance challenges, including the need to increase efficiencies, and empower citizens. While much attention has been paid to the technological obstacles of deploying advanced IoT infrastructures and devices, in this paper we argue that policymakers must also confront significant organizational barriers in the deployment of IoT due to collective action problems. Disparate authorities and conflicting goals and values among stakeholders, e.g. city executives, for-profit companies, and local constituents, create challenging coordination and resource allocation problems for municipalities to effectively deploy and govern smart ICTs. To analyze these deployment and governance challenges, we draw on research from science and technology studies (Hughes, 1969) to frame smart cities as large technological systems, consisting not just of technologies but organizational and institutional processes as well as economic theories (Gavrilets & Fortunato, 2014; Hardin, 1968; Ostrom, 2010) to conceptualize the collective action problems of IoT governance in municipalities. The paper draws on a sample of qualitative, in-depth interviews with senior city executives (administrative and political levels) of North American smart cities, including Boston, MA; Columbus, OH; Kansas City, MO; Los Angeles, CA; New Orleans, LA; Pittsburgh, PA; Syracuse, NY; and Toronto, ON. A document analysis of strategic and technical documents complements the data set. Using this combined data set, the paper deploys a large technological systems perspective to identify overarching themes affecting the use of ICTs in smart cities. We find that issues related to disparate – and at times competing – stakeholder motives and goals play a strong role in inhibiting the deployment of smart city technologies. Preliminary findings, suggest that challenges in smart cities are also organizational, associated with acting collectively, rather than solely technological, associated with utilizing the ‘right’ technologies. This is in particular the case with regard to preserving privacy and security as well as mitigating risk from city-wide IoT deployments (e.g., smart transportation). We further find that due to the networked property of smart cities, addressing cybersecurity risk requires identifying effective collective arrangements with the stakeholders responsible for managing risk. As even advanced and mature smart city initiatives have increasingly faced these challenges, including significant overhauls of such efforts (e.g., Kansas City, MO), the paper will conclude by offering important and timely recommendations for how policymakers may overcome these collective action challenges caused by negative externalities, risks of failure and disaster, and management, control and coordination problems – and as such inform future ICT implementation and governance strategies for smart cities.","Smart Cities as Large Technological Systems: Collective Action Problems as Organizational Barriers to Urban Digital TransformationIn a race to develop ‘smart cities’, policymakers in metropolitan regions across the world are rapidly deploying IoT devices, sensors, and emerging ICTs, including AI and facial recognition to solve various urban governance challenges, including the need to increase efficiencies, and empower citizens.

Sen’s framework recognizes individual variations in converting resources into valuable ‘functionings’, and herein emphasizes the importance of aligning personal, social, and environmental conversion factors for individuals to fully navigate, participate in, and enjoy the benefits provided by smart cities. Adopting the capability approach and employing a cross-disciplinary analysis of the scientific literature, the primary objective is to broaden understanding of how to improve inclusivity and accessibility within smart-city societies, with a specific focus on marginalized community members facing first- and second-level digital divides. This paper underscores the importance of adopting a systemic perspective on climate-smart city navigation and stresses the importance of establishing a unified governing body responsible for monitoring, evaluating, and enhancing smart-city functionality. The paper concludes by summarizing some policy recommendations to boost social inclusion and address climate change in smart cities, such as creating capability-enhancing institutions, safeguarding redundancy in public-choice options, empowering citizens, and leveraging academic knowledge in smart-city policy formulation.","

Taşkın Dirsehan and Liesbet van Zoonen,2022,Smart city technologies from the perspective of technology acceptance,"Most studies in the literature aim to discuss and examine the technologies in smart cities. Much less is known about the dynamics of their acceptance by citizens. Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature review of studies examining the acceptance of smart city technologies (SCTs), focussing particularly on Technology User Acceptance Models (TAM). Using a novel framework of SCTs based on the technology visibility and citizen interaction, we categorise them as individual‐based explicit SCTs, collective‐purpose explicit SCTs, digitising SCTs, and infrastructure SCTs. We assess that studies about citizen acceptation of SCTs have been mainly focussed on individual technologies. Also, the review shows that the field is nascent and fragmented, and that a wide variety of variables have been used to predict the adoption of individual‐based explicit SCTs, with the classic ones of TAM (perceived use and perceived usefulness) unmistakably being relevant in the smart city context as well. As a result of the fragmentation of the field, our review was not yet able to identify generalisable knowledge about the acceptance of the smart city and its technologies by citizens. We end with some suggestions for future research approaches and designs.","Smart city technologies from the perspective of technology acceptanceMost studies in the literature aim to discuss and examine the technologies in smart cities.

This has important implications for the development and implementation of future smart cities. The last two decades of smart city research has presented smart cities as a generic, universal aspiration without taking into consideration such local cultural differences. Future smart cities have several tasks ahead of them. The first is selecting culturally appropriate technologies from the vast array of global technologies now on offer. The second task is adapting such technology and the third task is in managing the acceptance of such technology. The above process is not linear but must be iterative, with technology acceptance considered simultaneously alongside the selection and adoption of such technologies. This study integrates the substantial literature on Technology Acceptance Modelling into the smart city discourse to begin to address this need. It also further develops our understanding of technology acceptance using the Structural Equation Modelling Method. A new synthetic model is proposed consisting of twelve factors, which have been selected based on a targeted literature review. A survey-based method was used to develop and cross-validate the model sampling a diverse population from various Iranian cities. The result of the above process is a new model named the Urban Services Technology Acceptance Model (USTAM). The validated model includes key factors related to technology such as Self-Efficacy, Operation, Work Facilitation, Relative Advantage and Compatibility. The USTAM is a useful tool for the prediction of technology acceptance in the implementation of smart cities. The final model is significant for various reasons. Firstly, it is significant for ensuring that selected technology is appropriate to local cultural contexts. Secondly it is significant to ensure that integration of technologies at metropolitan scales is managed effectively. The final significant reason is that it is well-suited to helping developing economies participate in the smart city boom in a resource efficient manner. The proposed model can potentially help cities achieve this by guiding them in the selection of appropriate technologies.

Research in this field is in its infancy, fragmented along disciplinary lines and often based on single city case studies. As a result, we lack both the theoretical insight and empirical evidence required to assess the implications of this potentially transformative phenomenon. Given the significant implications of smart urbanism there is an urgent need to critically engage with why, how, for whom and with what consequences smart urbanism is emerging in different urban contexts. The aim of this review is to unpack the different logics and rationales behind smart urbanism discourses and proposals, and in this way understand the ways by which imaginaries of urban futures are currently being constructed, along with their socio-technical and political implications for future research priorities.",1
"Kitchin, Rob",2014,{The real-time city? Big data and smart urbanism,"Smart cities' is a term that has gained traction in academia, business and government to describe cities that, on the one hand, are increasingly composed of and monitored by pervasive and ubiquitous computing and, on the other, whose economy and governance is being driven by innovation, creativity and entrepreneurship, enacted by smart people. This paper focuses on the former and, drawing on a number of examples, details how cities are being instrumented with digital devices and infrastructure that produce 'big data'. Such data, smart city advocates argue enables real-time analysis of city life, new modes of urban governance, and provides the raw material for envisioning and enacting more efficient, sustainable, competitive, productive, open and transparent cities. The final section of the paper provides a critical reflection on the implications of big data and smart urbanism, examining five emerging concerns: the politics of big urban data, technocratic governance and city development, corporatisation of city governance and technological lock-ins, buggy, brittle and hackable cities, and the panoptic city. {\textcopyright","{The real-time city?

Sen's framework recognizes individual variations in converting resources into valuable ‘functionings', and herein emphasizes the importance of aligning personal, social, and environmental conversion factors for individuals to fully navigate, participate in, and enjoy the benefits provided by smart cities. Adopting the capability approach and employing a cross-disciplinary analysis of the scientific literature, the primary objective is to broaden understanding of how to improve inclusivity and accessibility within smart-city societies, with a specific focus on marginalized community members facing first- and second-level digital divides. This paper underscores the importance of adopting a systemic perspective on climate-smart city navigation and stresses the importance of establishing a unified governing body responsible for monitoring, evaluating, and enhancing smart-city functionality. The paper concludes by summarizing some policy recommendations to boost social inclusion and address climate change in smart cities, such as creating capability-enhancing institutions, safeguarding redundancy in public-choice options, empowering citizens, and leveraging academic knowledge in smart-city policy formulation.","{Smart Cities for All?

Recent research highlighted that COVID-19 heightened the existing structural inequities and further exacerbated the technology-related social divide, especially for racialized communities, including new immigrants, refugees, and ethnic minorities. The intersection of challenges associated with racial identity (eg, racial discrimination and cultural differences), socioeconomic marginalization, and age- and gender-related barriers affects their access to health and social services, education, economic activity, and social life owing to digital inequity. Objective: Our aim is to understand the current state of knowledge on digital equity and the digital divide (which is often considered a complex social-political challenge) among racialized communities in urban cities of high-income countries and how they impact the social interactions, economic activities, and mental well-being of racialized city dwellers. Methods: We will conduct an integrative review adapting the Whittemore and Knafl methodology to summarize past empirical or theoretical literature describing digital equity issues pertaining to urban racialized communities. The context will be limited to studies on multicultural cities in high-income countries (eg, Calgary, Alberta) in the last 10 years. We will use a comprehensive search of 8 major databases across multiple disciplines and gray literature (eg, Google Scholar), using appropriate search terms related to digital “in/equity” and “divide.” A 2-stage screening will be conducted, including single citation tracking and a hand search of reference lists. Results will be synthesized using thematic analysis guidelines. Results: As of August 25, 2022, we have completed a systematic search of 8 major academic databases from multiple disciplines, gray literature, and citation or hand searching. After duplicate removal, we identified 8647 articles from all sources. Two independent reviewers are expected to complete the 2-step screening (title, abstract, and full-text screening) using Covidence followed by data extraction and analysis in 4 months (by December 2022). Data will be extracted regarding digital equity–related initiatives, programs, activities, research findings, issues, barriers, policies, recommendations, etc. Thematic analysis will reveal how barriers and facilitators of digital equity affect or benefit racialized population groups and what social, material, and systemic issues need to be addressed to establish digital equity for racialized communities in the context of a multicultural city. Conclusions: This project will inform public policy about digital inequity alongside conventional systemic inequities (eg, education and income levels); promote digital equity by exploring and examining the pattern, extent, and determinants and barriers of digital inequity across sociodemographic variables and groups; and analyze its interconnectedness with spatial dimensions and variations of the urban sphere (geographic differences).

Consequently, semi-structured interviews were conducted to perceive the reasons for the incompatibility between different systems and digital skill gaps between the public. The findings show that the most likely challenges are information security risks and privacy violations, which are due to the increase in vulnerability, potential attacks, and lack of public awareness regarding personal data protection.

Recently a robust literature has emerged that is critical of the techno-determinism inherent in smart city discussions.

By foregrounding the human dimensions of technology appropriation and the interface with livelihoods in their particular spatial contexts, this paper consciously decentres the dominant smart city discourse by arguing for the foregrounding of local dynamics. This paper rejects the universalisms embedded in smart city promises and argues that by provincialising the idea of smart urbanism, opportunities are presented for understanding the true markers of contemporary urbanism. Critical debates on the smart city, and by extension the need to consider smart urbanism contextually and as an infrastructure, relationally, together with the conceptual insights provided by postcolonial science and technology studies, contribute to a proposed frame for researching the ongoing dynamic between contemporary urban life and technological innovation.

In this context, digital information technology provides a new tool for efficient and effective management and planning of urban space, inter alia in the field of transportation, environment, public facilities or advanced service provision to citizens. This paper aims to offer, first, a concise overview of the emerging opportunities of information and communication technology (ICT) for smart urban policy; digital technology in particular, appears to provide novel pathways for modern planning strategies in smart cities. Against this background, the paper sketches out the complex force field of global urbanisation phenomena and highlights the data and information needs for strategic planning of cities (using inter alia as a framework the so-called ‘urban piazza' strategy framework). Secondly, various new decision support tools that are currently emerging and that offer a new promising scope for handling complex urban management issues (for instance, on accessibility, congestion, safety or sustainability) are briefly presented. And finally, the potential of such digital data systems for urban management and policy is concisely illustrated by means of some recent applications in the area of smartphone data systems. The paper concludes with a discussion of the challenges ahead for urban policy, inter alia by paying attention to institutional and governance aspects of ‘big digital data' management in urban systems.","{The significance of digital data systems for smart city policyOur planet is gradually moving towards an urbanized world.

"Cocchia, Annalisa",2014,{Smart and Digital City: A Systematic Literature Review,"The concept of Smart City embraces several definitions depending on the meanings of the word “smart”: intelligent city, knowledge city, ubiquitous city, sustainable city, digital city, etc. Many definitions of Smart City exist, but no one has been universally acknowledged yet. From literature analysis it emerges that Smart City and Digital City are the most used terminologies in literature to indicate the smartness of a city. This Chapter explores the literature about Smart City and Digital City from 1993 to the end of 2012 in order to investigate how these two concepts were born, how they have developed, which are the shared features and differences between them. To accomplish with these goals, three steps were followed: (1) to set up a search strategy for systematic literature review to collect a representative subset of papers about Smart City and Digital City using Google Scholar; (2) to store the selected subset in an ad-doc database to synthesize the literature review; (3) to organize the literature review subset to extract quantitative and qualitative data and information about Smart City and Digital City evolution.

"Capdevila, Ignasi and Zarlenga, Mat{\'{i",2015,{Smart city or smart citizens? The Barcelona case,"Purpose – In recent years, the term “smart city” has attracted a lot of attention from policy makers, business leaders and citizenship in general. Although there is not a unique definition of what a smart city is, it is generally accepted that “smart” urban policies refer to local governments' initiatives that use information and communication technologies in order to increase the quality of life of their inhabitants while contributing to a sustainable development. So far, “smart city” approaches have generally been related to top-down processes of technology diffusion. The purpose of this paper is to present a broader view on “smart” initiatives to analyze both top-down and bottom-up dynamics in a smart city. The authors argue that these two perspectives are complementary and its combination can reinforce the collaboration between different city stakeholders. Top-down and bottom-up initiatives are not opposed forces but, on the contrary, can have a synergistic effect on the innovation capacity of the city. Both perspectives are illustrated by providing examples of different “smart” aspects in the city of Barcelona: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. Design/methodology/approach – To illustrate the arguments, the authors analyze the case of the city of Barcelona providing examples of top-down and bottom-up initiatives in four different smart city aspects: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. The research method is based on a case study (Yin, 1984). The primary data consisted on interviews to city council representatives as well as managers of local public institutions, like economic development offices, and local organizations like for instance coworking spaces. The authors interviewed also specialists on the innovation history of the city in order to validate the data. In addition, the authors used secondary data such as reports on the 22@, and documentation on the Barcelona innovation policies, as well as doing a compilation of press articles and the online content of the institutional webpages. All together, the authors have followed a data triangulation strategy to seek data validation based on the cross-verification of the analyzed data sources. Findings – The analysis suggests that the top-down and bottom-up perspectives are complementary and their combination can reinforce the collaboration between different city stakeholders. Top-down and bottom-up initiatives are not opposed forces but, on the contrary, can have a synergistic effect on the innovation capacity of the city. Both perspectives are illustrated by providing examples of different “smart” aspects in the city of Barcelona: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. Research limitations/implications – Nevertheless, the analysis has its limitations. Even if the authors have emphasized the importance of the bottom-up initiatives, citizens do not have often the resources to act without governmental intervention. This is the case of services that require high-cost infrastructures or regulatory changes. Also, as it usually happens in the case of disruptive technology, it is hard for citizens to understand the possibilities of its use. In these cases, firms and institutions must play an important role in the first phases of the diffusion of innovations, by informing and incentivizing its use. It is also important to note that some of the emerging usages of technology are confronted to legal or regulatory issues. For instance, distributed and shared Wi-Fi networks might be in opposition to economic interests of internet providers, that often difficult its expansion. It is also the case of services of the sharing economy that represent a menace to established institutions (like the tensions between Uber and taxi companies, or Airbnb and hotels). In these cases, city halls like it is the case in Barcelona, tend to respond to these emergent uses of technology by regulating to ensure protection to existing corporate services. Practical implications – In conclusion, the transformational process that leads a city to become a smart city has to take in consideration the complexity and the plurality of the urban reality. Beyond considering citizens as being users, testers or consumers of technology, local administrations that are able to identify, nourish and integrate the emerging citizens' initiatives would contribute to the reinforcement of a smart city reality. Originality/value – The contribution of the paper is to go beyond the generalized technologic discourse around smart cities by adding the layer of the citizens' initiatives.","{Smart city or smart citizens?

"Trencher, Gregory",2019,{Towards the smart city 2.0: Empirical evidence of using smartness as a tool for tackling social challenges,"While scholars critique the first-generation of the corporate smart city for failing to tackle people-oriented agendas and authentically respond to the needs of residents, many point to a potential to move beyond narrow environmental and economic objectives and tackle social issues. But concrete empirical evidence of this potential is visibly lacking. In parallel, researchers have brought attention to the emergence of the so-called ‘smart city 2.0'. This is framed as a decentralised, people-centric approach where smart technologies are employed as tools to tackle social problems, address resident needs and foster collaborative participation. This contrasts to the techno-economic and centralised approach of the dominating ‘smart city 1.0' or first-generation paradigm, which is primarily focused on diffusing smart technologies for corporate and economic interests. Utilising this dichotomy as an analytical framework, this paper examines Aizuwakamatsu Smart City in Fukushima, Japan to demonstrate how a smart city can be framed and implemented as a tool for tackling endogenous social challenges. Findings unearth a myriad of novel approaches to utilising data and ICT to respond to resident needs, improve livelihoods and widely share smart city benefits. Yet they also point to a need to transcend polarised discourses around alternative models of smart cities and appreciate the messy reality of hybrid, on-the-ground smart urbanisation and the co-existence of contrasting yet complementary visions and approaches.","{Towards the smart city .: Empirical evidence of using smartness as a tool for tackling social challengesWhile scholars critique the first-generation of the corporate smart city for failing to tackle people-oriented agendas and authentically respond to the needs of residents, many point to a potential to move beyond narrow environmental and economic objectives and tackle social issues.

Insights from a quasi-natural experiment based on Chinese pilot policy,"Purpose: With the help of a quasi-natural experiment on Chinese policies, this study aims to understand the actual contribution of Smart City (SC) policies to the development of information and communications technology (ICT) in different cities. It also discusses the social and digital differences that such policies may generate, with a particular focus on the potential for exacerbating urban inequalities. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve this, the study employs a principal component analysis (PCA) to develop an ICT development indicator system. It then employs a difference-in-differences (DID) model to analyze panel data from 209 Chinese cities over the period from 2007 to 2019, examining the impact of SC policies on ICT development across various urban settings. Findings: Our findings show that SC policies have significantly contributed to the enhancement of ICT development, especially in ICT usage. However, SC policies may inadvertently reinforce developmental disparities among cities. Compared to less developed areas, the benefits of SC policies are more pronounced in economically booming cities. This is likely due to the agglomeration of the ICT industry and the strong allure of developed urban centers for high-caliber talent. Originality/value: This study contributes to the related literature by explaining the role of SC policies in driving ICT development and by focusing on the often-overlooked impact of SC policies on urban inequality. These findings can provide guidance to policymakers on the need to recognize and address existing urban inequalities.","{Does building smart cities necessarily enhance urban ICT development?

What is the implication of the main finding? The framework is meant to act as a starting point in the design of inclusive digital urban policies and strategies and can also be employed to assess the directions taken to date by city governments towards more inclusive practices. While cities on a global scale embrace smartness as a roadmap for efficient urban governance, disparities persist in the domain of digital accessibility, literacy, and skills, with manifestations of digital exclusion, ageism, and ableism prevalent in most digital urban experiences. Despite their commitment to bridging the digital divide, governments lack comprehensive frameworks to inform policymaking and action for inclusion in smart cities. This review paper aims to deepen the understanding of the multifaceted challenges confronting the governance of inclusion in smart cities. Drawing from a review of research encompassing digital inclusion, digital transitions, smart cities, and urban governance, we discuss who is included and excluded in the governance of smart cities; what are the necessary conditions to be met for smart cities to be considered inclusive; and how can smart city governance deliver public value and equal benefits for all. As a novel contribution, this paper outlines a reflective framework to inform citizen inclusion in the governance of smart cities.

CHILDCARE,2021,{Health and Safety in Child Care – eXtension Alliance for Better Child Care,"This book begins with a middle-range theory of sustainable smart city transitions, which forms bridges between theorizing in smart city development studies and some of the foundational assumptions underpinning transition management and system innovation research, human geography, spatial planning, and critical urban scholarship. This interdisciplinary theoretical formulation details our evidence-based interpretation of how smart city transitions should be conceptualized and enacted in order to overcome the oversimplification fallacy resulting from corporate discourses on smart urbanism. By offering a broad and realistic understanding of smart city transitions, the proposed theory combines different smart-city-related concepts in a model which attempts to expose what causal mechanisms surface in sustainable smart city transitions and to guide empirical inquiry in smart city research. Together with all the authors contributing to this book, our objective is to give smart city research more robust scientific foundations and to generate theoretical propositions upon which subsequent large-scale empirical testing can be conducted. With the proposed middle-range theory, different empirical settings can be investigated by using the same analytical elements, facilitating the cross-case analysis and synthesis of the systematic research efforts which are progressively contributing to shedding light on the assemblage of sustainable smart city transitions.","{Health and Safety in Child Care – eXtension Alliance for Better Child CareThis book begins with a middle-range theory of sustainable smart city transitions, which forms bridges between theorizing in smart city development studies and some of the foundational assumptions underpinning transition management and system innovation research, human geography, spatial planning, and critical urban scholarship.

A questionnaire was administered in order to determine the influence of seven factors–effort expectancy, self-efficacy, perceived privacy, perceived security, trust in technology, price value and trust in government–on behaviour intention, specifically the decision to adopt smart-city technologies. Results show that each of these factors significantly influenced citizen intention to use smart-city services. They also reveal perceived security and perceived privacy to be strong determinants of trust in technology, and price value a determinant of trust in government. In turn, both types of trust are shown to increase user intention to both adopt and use smart-city services.

"Yelland, Nicola",2013,Engaging the Disengaged: Inclusive approaches to teaching the least advantaged,"Learning objectives To recognise the characteristics of millennial kids. To understand the contemporary nature of a digital divide. To make connections between the digital divide and social inclusion. To think about curriculums and pedagogical reforms that flow from the use of new technologies that support digital and social inclusion for families from low socioeconomic areas. Introduction When the digital divide was first conceptualised (Gore 1998) it focused on the ‘haves' and ‘have nots' with regard to having access to computer technology or not. While access remains a contentious issue it is readily apparent that the focus eventually shifted to the quality of access to the internet via dial-up or broadband. This was because those who had access via dial-up had their actions considerably restricted by the poorer quality of the connection while those on broadband had a broader range of possibilities available to them, resulting in a new divide. Today, while access is not universal, it needs to be considered in terms of the quality of the activities that being connected to the internet via a computer, or any device, affords as well as the expectations that teachers have of their students in these new learning contexts. In contemporary times digital engagement and social inclusion are important issues of concern in globalised contexts. This chapter argues that discussions of equity and social inclusion need to consider qualitatively different types of use of new technologies. It asserts that pedagogies concerned with socially disadvantaged students need to recognise that there are qualitatively different types of activities that can be conducted with new media and support students to become fluent in all of them and not just those that fulfil the criteria for access. This means taking a new approach and creating contexts for teaching and learning that value the life experiences of students and support them to encounter, and have success with, higher levels of sophisticated activities that are respectful of their needs and interests.","Engaging the Disengaged: Inclusive approaches to teaching the least advantagedLearning objectives To recognise the characteristics of millennial kids.

However, the real-world impacts of this transformation have been considerably slower than other domains of digital innovation. In this work, we study the interplay between the core properties of digital platforms and the urban innovation contexts that aim to promote digital transition as a means to generate value for cities and its citizens. The research methodology is based on a literature review, which aimed to characterise the key limitations preventing smart city initiatives from attaining the same level of fast paced innovation as other areas of computational science, and seek for alternative innovation practices. The results suggest that innovation practices in the context of smart city initiatives seem to be framed by a key trade-off between the idea that only global solutions may be able to capture the full benefits of digital innovation and the idea that each city is unique and must pave its own way towards digital transition. From the analysis of those results, we derive five design principles for new service-based platforms.

The selection of smart city verticals (or areas of focus for smart city programs) within processes of urban governance has implications for which aspects of the urban agenda become prioritized. Through a study of seven UK smart cities, the paper investigates the framing of city problems, selection of smart verticals, and decision-making logics. The findings highlight that the selection of smart city verticals within the case study cities is rooted in four key considerations: challenges in service delivery, pragmatism, entrepreneurialism, and broader national and global events and policy agendas. These considerations transcend different spatial scales and governance arrangements, raising questions around democratic accountability and transparency.

{Di Bernardo,2023,{Moving towards a people-centric smart city,"European cities are getting smarter. Smart technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Everything (IoE), and other AI-based technologies, are being injected more directly into the lives of citizens. Smart cities are seen as evolving ecosystems in which multiple actors act, react and interact over time to foster innovative solutions and provide better services for citizens. Despite the growing interest, existing research has to make key advances, important gaps persist as scholars lag behind theoretical development and rarely take into account the most important element of a city: people. Business and management scholars have focused on how to define strategies in smart cities, local policy, and others investigated the challenges of building a smart city. Few concerns deal with humans. In addressing these shortcomings, we tried to highlight why any smart city should be a community that learns, adapts, co-creates, and innovates. The purpose of this study is to investigate the human perspective that goes beyond the focus on technology related to smart cities in Europe, through an analysis in depth on how and how much citizens make cities smart. The focus is on people and their well-being combined with the shared knowledge and development that arises from each player in the ecosystem. To get an overall vision of the people-centric smart city we carry out an exploratory literature review with a PRISMA protocol that guides the identification of the studies to be included in the review. We finally provide implications for scholars and practitioners and suggest future research opportunities.","{Moving towards a people-centric smart cityEuropean cities are getting smarter.

"McFarlane, Colin and S{\""{o",2017,{On alternative smart cities: From a technology-intensive to a knowledge-intensive smart urbanism,"Smart urbanism seems to be everywhere you turn. But in practice the agenda is an uncertain one, usually only partially developed, and often more about corporate-led urban development than about urban social justice. Rather than leave smart urbanism to the corporate and political elites, there are opportunities now for critical urban scholarship to not only critique how it is currently constituted, but to give shape to a globally oriented alternative smart urban agenda. An ambition like this means taking the ‘urban' in ‘smart urban' much more seriously. It means foregrounding the knowledges, political priorities and needs of those either actively excluded or included in damaging ways in mainstream smart urban discourses. We outline steps towards an alternative smart urbanism. We seek to move beyond the specific to the general and do so by drawing on radically different initiatives across the Global North and South. These initiatives provide tantalizing openings to a more socially just use of digital technology, where urban priorities and justice drive the use—or lack of use—of technology.","{On alternative smart cities: From a technology-intensive to a knowledge-intensive smart urbanismSmart urbanism seems to be everywhere you turn.

The increasing use of web-based Geographic Information Systems (GIS) applications raises awareness of spatial issues that impact on defined municipal areas, whilst interactive mapping provides opportunities for addressing spatial concerns virtually. Most of the literature does, however, focus on the experience of developed countries where capacity and resources permit a sophisticated understanding of ICT. Yet, evidence suggests that these tools are also used in some developing countries, with India often cited as one of the leading countries in achieving ICT prominence, but little seems to be published about this experience in Southern Africa. There are a number of innovative initiatives underway in South African local governments but most of these interventions are in their infancy. In contrast, there are a number of examples in developed countries that may provide some guidance for developing cities.

To achieve a smooth and effective transition to SSC, policies and delivery mechanisms should be put in place, and the readiness of both the government and the society should be assessed. This study focuses on digital participatory planning (DPP) as a precondition for social sustainability in SSC and aims to summarise and assess the current relevant local policies and endeavours in Oman; and to develop a generic framework to evaluate the readiness for DPP. In doing so, selective key literature, policies and initiatives were critically reviewed covering the SSC concept, establishing the link between the SSC and DPP, and eliciting a list of comprehensive DPP readiness factors. The results indicated that the Omani government has a clear will to move towards SSC and the country has already witnessed few initiatives supporting this direction. However, there is a lack of a clear action plan regarding DPP. Therefore, more work is required to systemise efforts. The study provides a generic framework to assess the readiness of the government and society for DPP and concludes with recommendations for policymakers.","{Towards sustainable smart cities: A study on digital participatory planning in OmanMany cities are undergoing a transition towards sustainable smart cities (SSCs) that are built on advanced information technology infrastructure and support social justice.

Accordingly, many IoT-based smart concepts appeared in our daily lives such as smart home, smart healthcare and smart city. There are several factors accelerating or hindering the adoption of such new services and concepts. So, the acceptance of IoT-based smart services is critical and should be analyzed carefully. In this study, we aimed to prepare a proper starting point for future studies on end user acceptance of smart city services and IoT technologies by presenting a comprehensive systematic review of literature. We got 34 articles focusing on the adoption of IoT-based services with a model-based approach among initially resulted 237 papers. Our findings indicate that the adoption of smart services is getting more and more popular in recent years, especially in Asian countries. We also see that most reviewed studies prefer to develop integrated adoption models and deploy the factors of technology acceptance model (TAM). Additionally, our review results show that the researchers studying on this field generally use demographics in adoption models, mostly as control variables. This paper presents valuable findings lightening up the way of researchers who want to develop an adoption model for IoT-based smart services.","{A systematic review on smart city services and IoT-based technologiesDue to the technological developments, Internet of things (IoT) has become a real phenomenon.

In this context, two promising phenomena have gained interest from the academia, the public sector and the media: “smart cities” and “urban sharing”. Smart cities rely on the extensive use of information and communications technology (ICT) to increase efficiencies in urban areas, while urban sharing builds on the collaborative use of idling resources enabled by ICT in densely populated cities. The concepts have many similar features and share common goals, yet cities with smart city agendas often fail to take a stance on urban sharing. Thus, its potentials are going largely unnoticed by local governments. This article addresses this issue by exploring cases of London and Berlin–two ICT-dense cities with clearly articulated smart city agendas and an abundance of sharing platforms. Drawing on urban governance literature, we develop a conceptual framework that specifies the roles that cities assume when governing urban sharing: city as regulator, city as provider, city as enabler and city as consumer. We find that both cities indirectly support urban sharing through smart agenda programmes, which aim to facilitate ICT-enabled technical innovation and emergence of start-ups. However, programmes, strategies, support schemes and regulations aimed directly at urban sharing initiatives are few. We also find that Berlin is sceptical towards urban sharing organisations, while London took more of a collaborative approach.

The making of a smart city imaginary in Kolkata, India","‘Smart' imaginaries have been enthusiastically embraced by urban planners and policymakers around the world. Indians are no exception. Between 2015–2018, following national government guidelines to use participatory and inclusive processes, many cities developed proposals for a smart city challenge. Successful proposals received financial and technical support from the national government. We examine the making of the smart city proposal submitted by New Town Kolkata (NTK). We ask how (un)democratic was the making of the proposal, along three aspects: distributive, participatory, and responsive. Based on an analysis of documents and interviews with policymakers and citizens, we find that NTK's smart city imaginary largely failed to be distributive. It rarely accounted for the specific needs of poorer and vulnerable citizens. City officials invested considerable effort in using participatory techniques, but citizen participation was tightly controlled through top-down design and practice of the techniques. The latter often facilitated one-way flow of information from the city administration to the citizens. The proposal was responsive to some citizens' voices, but only those belonging to the more affluent classes. A messy diversity of citizens' voices was thus closed down, as the city officials filtered and cherry-picked citizens' voices that were well-aligned with the official technocratic vision of ‘global' smart urbanism. The paper shows how democracy can be put in the service of technocracy, within a rhetoric of citizen participation and social inclusion that embodies smart urbanism.","{Smart as (un)democratic?

"Capdevila, Ignasi and Zarlenga, Mat{\'{i",2015,{Smart city or smart citizens? The Barcelona case,"Purpose – In recent years, the term “smart city” has attracted a lot of attention from policy makers, business leaders and citizenship in general. Although there is not a unique definition of what a smart city is, it is generally accepted that “smart” urban policies refer to local governments' initiatives that use information and communication technologies in order to increase the quality of life of their inhabitants while contributing to a sustainable development. So far, “smart city” approaches have generally been related to top-down processes of technology diffusion. The purpose of this paper is to present a broader view on “smart” initiatives to analyze both top-down and bottom-up dynamics in a smart city. The authors argue that these two perspectives are complementary and its combination can reinforce the collaboration between different city stakeholders. Top-down and bottom-up initiatives are not opposed forces but, on the contrary, can have a synergistic effect on the innovation capacity of the city. Both perspectives are illustrated by providing examples of different “smart” aspects in the city of Barcelona: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. Design/methodology/approach – To illustrate the arguments, the authors analyze the case of the city of Barcelona providing examples of top-down and bottom-up initiatives in four different smart city aspects: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. The research method is based on a case study (Yin, 1984). The primary data consisted on interviews to city council representatives as well as managers of local public institutions, like economic development offices, and local organizations like for instance coworking spaces. The authors interviewed also specialists on the innovation history of the city in order to validate the data. In addition, the authors used secondary data such as reports on the 22@, and documentation on the Barcelona innovation policies, as well as doing a compilation of press articles and the online content of the institutional webpages. All together, the authors have followed a data triangulation strategy to seek data validation based on the cross-verification of the analyzed data sources. Findings – The analysis suggests that the top-down and bottom-up perspectives are complementary and their combination can reinforce the collaboration between different city stakeholders. Top-down and bottom-up initiatives are not opposed forces but, on the contrary, can have a synergistic effect on the innovation capacity of the city. Both perspectives are illustrated by providing examples of different “smart” aspects in the city of Barcelona: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. Research limitations/implications – Nevertheless, the analysis has its limitations. Even if the authors have emphasized the importance of the bottom-up initiatives, citizens do not have often the resources to act without governmental intervention. This is the case of services that require high-cost infrastructures or regulatory changes. Also, as it usually happens in the case of disruptive technology, it is hard for citizens to understand the possibilities of its use. In these cases, firms and institutions must play an important role in the first phases of the diffusion of innovations, by informing and incentivizing its use. It is also important to note that some of the emerging usages of technology are confronted to legal or regulatory issues. For instance, distributed and shared Wi-Fi networks might be in opposition to economic interests of internet providers, that often difficult its expansion. It is also the case of services of the sharing economy that represent a menace to established institutions (like the tensions between Uber and taxi companies, or Airbnb and hotels). In these cases, city halls like it is the case in Barcelona, tend to respond to these emergent uses of technology by regulating to ensure protection to existing corporate services. Practical implications – In conclusion, the transformational process that leads a city to become a smart city has to take in consideration the complexity and the plurality of the urban reality. Beyond considering citizens as being users, testers or consumers of technology, local administrations that are able to identify, nourish and integrate the emerging citizens' initiatives would contribute to the reinforcement of a smart city reality. Originality/value – The contribution of the paper is to go beyond the generalized technologic discourse around smart cities by adding the layer of the citizens' initiatives.","{Smart city or smart citizens?

The AI and Digital Transformation Competency Framework unpacks the major AI and digital transformation competencies needed in the public sector. The framework aims to provide guidance not just for civil servants, but for interrnational organisations and regional and national actors to support capacity development. Each Competency Domain is structured around three Proficiency Levels: Basic, Medium and Advanced, and includes an ' AIIspecific level' that aims to identify and unpack the major AI elements.",1

Metropolitan municipalities in South Africa have joined the technology revolution that embraces smart services delivery through various ICTs and advances the idea of e-governance using the Stakeholder Inclusive Approach. To comprehend how the City of Johannesburg (CoJ) encourages inclusion in smart services, the researchers use an explorative qualitative design that works well with the inclusive stakeholder approach, which supports a collaborative process in ICT adoption. The study discovered through qualitative thematic analysis that inclusiveness is a comprehensive process that considers the demands of different stakeholders in the adoption and implementation of ICT. One issue that leads to ICT efficiencies in the CoJ is data fragmentation from numerous municipal agencies. Inclusionary participation has been widespread in virtual Integrated Development Planning (IDP) forums and other cutting-edge services provided by the CoJ. There have been some exceptional examples of free wifi supply. The study's conclusion reiterates the importance of comprehensive inclusion in ICT adoption and implementation as it links communities with the municipality and stresses the need for city officials to commit to upskilling programmes to improve the delivery of public goods and services delivery.

Le{\'{o,2020,{Technology as Ideology in Urban Governance,"This article argues that the turn toward smart cities, emphasizing solutions, services, and infrastructures driven by digital technologies, has reinforced a dominant ideology shaping urban decision making, frameworks, and outcomes. Two core dimensions of this ideology of technology in urban governance interact to consequentially reshape urban processes: (1) the priority of attracting high-technology industries as engines for urban economies and (2) the tendency to reframe urban problems into technological problems, to be addressed by technological solutions. Together, these mechanisms operate in conjunction to privilege technological needs, capacities, and priorities in urban governance, contributing to the widespread exclusion of people and problems beyond the scope of technology. Although not unprecedented, this ideology of technology has acquired renewed potency with neoliberalized urbanism, urban restructuring, and the ongoing information revolution. Furthermore, these changes intensify the ongoing transformation of cities (and space more generally) into digitized spaces tailored for capital accumulation in the context of digital and surveillance capitalism. To illustrate these dynamics, we briefly describe recent events in San Francisco, one of the key sites in the current techno-economic paradigm.

This study explores the acceptance of use of mobile phone data (MPD) in different areas, and how it is related to different types of trust. Based on a representative survey of citizens in the two smart cities, Oslo and Tallinn, four similar trust cultures are located. The acceptance of use of MPD differed significantly between the trust cultures and, as expected, was significantly stronger in groups with higher levels of trust, either generally or in terms of reliance on technologies. The acceptance of use of MPD for commercial product development was low for all groups. Findings suggest that future users of MPD need to be aware of the significant scepticism toward and rejection of the use of such data in large parts of the population. Unless visions of the smart city are grounded in the needs and wants of citizens, such plans are not likely to succeed, and negative understandings and images of a panoptic state may take stronger hold.

"Goodspeed, Robert",2015,{Smart cities: Moving beyond urban cybernetics to tackle wicked problems,"This article makes three related arguments. First, that although many definitions of the smart city have been proposed, corporate promoters say a smart city uses information technology to pursue efficient systems through real-time monitoring and control. Second, this definition is not new and equivalent to the idea of urban cybernetics debated in the 1970s. Third, drawing on a discussion of Rio de Janeiro's Operations Center, I argue that viewing urban problems as wicked problems allows for more fundamental solutions than urban cybernetics, but requires local innovation and stakeholder participation. Therefore the last section describes institutions for municipal innovation and IT-enabled collaborative planning.","{Smart cities: Moving beyond urban cybernetics to tackle wicked problemsThis article makes three related arguments.

Vod{\'{a,2021,{Advanced technologies and their use in smart city management,"Building Smart City management concepts is based on the implementation and use of advanced technologies. The primary impulse for writing the article was the ambition to identify the current advanced technologies of Smart City management. The aim of the article is to propose a general model for the implementation of advanced technologies for Smart City management, based on the knowledge gained from the analysis of literature and case studies. In order to fulfill the set goal, it is necessary to obtain answers to two research questions. The findings were obtained through a secondary analysis of the literature, i.e., relevant articles from the scientific databases Web of Science and Scopus analysis of case studies of the best Smart Cities practices. According to the Smart City Index 2020 and IESE Cities in Motion, the leaders among the Smart Cities are Singapore and London, followed by Helsinki. In addition to the analyses, the article also uses methods of summarization, comparison, creativity, logic, induction and deduction. Smart Cities use 12 identified advanced technologies in their practice. Strategic management in Singapore, London and Helsinki adapts technology to the needs and requirements of its citizens, thus connecting the technological aspect with the managerial and social aspects. The contributions of the work include results for fellow researchers and a model for strategic management of new Smart Cities. The results of the article provide fellow researchers with the findings of a secondary analysis of relevant articles, from which they can draw when writing their own publications without the need for time-consuming search of the articles about this topic in databases. The general model of implementation of advanced technologies serves as a basis for strategic management of new Smart Cities that want to implement a technological base and at the same time do not want to forget the managerial and social aspects. Testing the model in practice with a new Slovak Smart City is part of future research activities.","{Advanced technologies and their use in smart city managementBuilding Smart City management concepts is based on the implementation and use of advanced technologies.

Bridging Digital Divides for Socially Sustainable and Inclusive Cities,"This paper aims to emphasize the need for enhancing inclusivity and accessibility within smart-city societies. It represents the first attempt to apply Amartya Sen's capability approach by exploring the implications of digital divides for promoting inclusive and climate-friendly cities that prioritize well-being, equity, and societal participation. Sen's framework recognizes individual variations in converting resources into valuable ‘functionings', and herein emphasizes the importance of aligning personal, social, and environmental conversion factors for individuals to fully navigate, participate in, and enjoy the benefits provided by smart cities. Adopting the capability approach and employing a cross-disciplinary analysis of the scientific literature, the primary objective is to broaden understanding of how to improve inclusivity and accessibility within smart-city societies, with a specific focus on marginalized community members facing first- and second-level digital divides. This paper underscores the importance of adopting a systemic perspective on climate-smart city navigation and stresses the importance of establishing a unified governing body responsible for monitoring, evaluating, and enhancing smart-city functionality. The paper concludes by summarizing some policy recommendations to boost social inclusion and address climate change in smart cities, such as creating capability-enhancing institutions, safeguarding redundancy in public-choice options, empowering citizens, and leveraging academic knowledge in smart-city policy formulation.","{Smart Cities for All?

We examine how youth understand the impact of digital technologies on urban transformations and whether their technology skills and digital literacy give them a sense of ownership over the future of their city. Research was conducted within the context of a six-week summer educational program involving seventy-nine youth of color from public high schools in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The program mixed digital skill building with urban fieldwork to prototype solutions to long-standing urban problems: the sort of problems that smart city policies also seek to change. Our research points to a conundrum for youth. Although they embraced technological innovations, they indicated that digital technologies failed to serve the public or address pressing concerns they identified as problematic within the city: crime, drugs, and homelessness. Instead, in their view, digital technologies delivered the most benefit to private spaces in the home and workplace. Furthermore, the youth did not envision that emergent technologies would improve their neighborhoods or communities but only their employment prospects. This research suggests that the emergent smart city is reproducing actual as well as perceived urban inequities: Wealthy residential neighborhoods and spaces of the new economy become “smart,” but much of the city remains left behind. These patterns create a paradox for youth who invest in digital skills while remaining on the margins of technology-driven, smart urban change.

Such a scenario may lead to a ‘talent-in and talent-out' situation that reduces the entrepreneurial potential of the cities. Thus, city governments in emerging economies need to focus on building not only a regulatory environment, but also create a conducive environment for the key stakeholders in the ecosystem to encourage and promote citizen-led IoT interventions that would result in building inclusive smart cities.","{Smart cities and the citizen-driven internet of things: A qualitative inquiry into an emerging smart cityThis paper builds on institutional theory to understand the role that the institutional environment plays in emerging economies which encourage citizens to create Internet of Things (IoT)-based interventions.

This has important implications for the development and implementation of future smart cities. The last two decades of smart city research has presented smart cities as a generic, universal aspiration without taking into consideration such local cultural differences. Future smart cities have several tasks ahead of them. The first is selecting culturally appropriate technologies from the vast array of global technologies now on offer. The second task is adapting such technology and the third task is in managing the acceptance of such technology. The above process is not linear but must be iterative, with technology acceptance considered simultaneously alongside the selection and adoption of such technologies. This study integrates the substantial literature on Technology Acceptance Modelling into the smart city discourse to begin to address this need. It also further develops our understanding of technology acceptance using the Structural Equation Modelling Method. A new synthetic model is proposed consisting of twelve factors, which have been selected based on a targeted literature review. A survey-based method was used to develop and cross-validate the model sampling a diverse population from various Iranian cities. The result of the above process is a new model named the Urban Services Technology Acceptance Model (USTAM). The validated model includes key factors related to technology such as Self-Efficacy, Operation, Work Facilitation, Relative Advantage and Compatibility. The USTAM is a useful tool for the prediction of technology acceptance in the implementation of smart cities. The final model is significant for various reasons. Firstly, it is significant for ensuring that selected technology is appropriate to local cultural contexts. Secondly it is significant to ensure that integration of technologies at metropolitan scales is managed effectively. The final significant reason is that it is well-suited to helping developing economies participate in the smart city boom in a resource efficient manner. The proposed model can potentially help cities achieve this by guiding them in the selection of appropriate technologies. The proposed model is developed with specific reference to Iran and Bangladesh. The authors suggest that the model is useful for cities of different cultural identities and characteristics, who wish to initiate their own distinctive smart city strategies.","{Implementing citizen centric technology in developing smart cities: A model for predicting the acceptance of urban technologiesLocal urban identity, culture and knowledge ecosystems continue to shape innovative capacity and technological acceptance despite global exchange in talent, trade and technology.

Our research questions are: () what are the main topics in the literature related to social sustainability in smart cities? and () what are the gaps that require further investigation? Our review shows that inclusion and equity are crucial components that must be considered. More specifically, civic engagement is an effective method for smart cities to better understand and respond to all residents' social, economic, and environmental demands, enabling a more inclusive and equitable smart community.",1

"Dashkevych, Oleg and Portnov, Boris A.",2022,{Criteria for Smart City Identification: A Systematic Literature Review,"The transition towards greater smartness is an emerging trend in the development of modern cities. This transition manifests itself in the widespread adoption of information and communication technologies (ICTs), cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), and other technological tools aimed at improving the level of city smartness. Although numerous studies have focused on the smart city (SC) phenomenon, knowledge about empirical criteria that can be used to define a city as “smart” and to measure the degree of a city's “smartness” remains limited. The present study aims to bridge this knowledge gap by a systematic literature review of recent studies, in which various empirical criteria are used for SC identification. The study helps to identify a total of 48 SC identification metrics, which are further split into three main categories—smart digital technology, living conditions, and environmental (ecological) sustainability. Among these groups of criteria, the “smart digital technology” group of metrics appears to be the most popular, while criteria pertinent to “ecological sustainability” are applied considerably less often. As the study also reveals, only about half of the criteria used by empirical studies for SC identification actually relate to urban residents' needs, with the rest being general technological measures. Therefore, for a balanced SC assessment, we suggest a ranking system based on the nine most important metrics, which equally represent all the main aspects of the SC phenomenon while placing an emphasis on the improvement of the quality of life of local residents. The proposed system is applied to several major cities across the globe to demonstrate its use and usefulness.","{Criteria for Smart City Identification: A Systematic Literature ReviewThe transition towards greater smartness is an emerging trend in the development of modern cities.

This paper explores alternative ways in which citizens are positioned within different imaginaries of the smart city. The premise is that most mainstream discourses implicitly assume that smart city projects will empower and improve the lives of citizens. However, their role is often ambiguous. While some visions of the smart city are characterised by the absence of citizen's voices, others are populated by active citizens operating as urban sensors. Furthermore there are fearful visions of a future in which citizens will be subjugated by technologies that will hamper their freedom.

"Vanolo, Alberto",2016,{Is there anybody out there? The place and role of citizens in tomorrow's smart cities,"Imagining tomorrow's life implies, to a large degree, imagining the kind of cities we will inhabit in the future. In this framework, the smart city is actually a popular vision in discourses on urban development. This paper explores alternative ways in which citizens are positioned within different imaginaries of the smart city. The premise is that most mainstream discourses implicitly assume that smart city projects will empower and improve the lives of citizens. However, their role is often ambiguous. While some visions of the smart city are characterised by the absence of citizen's voices, others are populated by active citizens operating as urban sensors. Furthermore there are fearful visions of a future in which citizens will be subjugated by technologies that will hamper their freedom. This paper analyses the role of citizens in four alternative smart city imaginaries. The thesis proposed is that all four imaginaries are characterised by citizens playing a subaltern role, and hence the smart city is a relatively poor concept if intended as a model of the urban life of the future.","{Is there anybody out there?

As decision makers strive to find a technological fix, smart city strategies are often based on technological orthodoxies which are conceptually and empirically shallow. The motivation behind this paper is to address the conceptual adolescence which relates to the wholesale digitisation of the city by pursuing a twin argument about the democratic and environmental consequences. The authors draw on interdisciplinary theory and insights from urban studies, infrastructure, informatics, and the sociology of the Internet to critique the way the 'smart city' is taken forward. It is concluded that private firms market smart city services and solutions based on an ideological legacy of 'ubiquitous computing', 'universal infrastructure', and 'green technology'. Based on evidence from three UK cities-Manchester, Birmingham, and Glasgow-it is argued that the underlying principle of future city strategies is to expand the market for new technology products and services to support 'green growth' with disregard for their wider impacts. For citizens, becoming a consumer of the technologies is often presented as progressive 'participation' or 'empowerment' with unknown or hidden consequences both political and environmental. The city systems become a digital marketplace where citizen-consumers' participation is increasingly involuntary and the hegemony of global technology firms is inflated. What follows is that the city's 'intelligent systems' are defined through a digital consumer experience that has inherent biases and leaves parts of the city and its population unaccounted for. This renders the city less resilient in the face of future social and climatic risks. {\textcopyright","{Smart cities and green growth: Outsourcing democratic and environmental resilience to the global technology sectorClimate change and advances in urban technology propel forward the 'smart city'.

"Dirsehan, Taşkın and van Zoonen, Liesbet",2022,IET Smart Cities,"Most studies in the literature aim to discuss and examine the technologies in smart cities. Much less is known about the dynamics of their acceptance by citizens. Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature review of studies examining the acceptance of smart city technologies (SCTs), focussing particularly on Technology User Acceptance Models (TAM). Using a novel framework of SCTs based on the technology visibility and citizen interaction, we categorise them as individual-based explicit SCTs, collective-purpose explicit SCTs, digitising SCTs, and infrastructure SCTs. We assess that studies about citizen acceptation of SCTs have been mainly focussed on individual technologies. Also, the review shows that the field is nascent and fragmented, and that a wide variety of variables have been used to predict the adoption of individual-based explicit SCTs, with the classic ones of TAM (perceived use and perceived usefulness) unmistakably being relevant in the smart city context as well. As a result of the fragmentation of the field, our review was not yet able to identify generalisable knowledge about the acceptance of the smart city and its technologies by citizens.

"Martin, Chris J. and Evans, James and Karvonen, Andrew",2018,{Smart and sustainable? Five tensions in the visions and practices of the smart-sustainable city in Europe and North America,"Smart cities are increasingly advocated by governments and the private sector as the primary means to deliver urban sustainability. Particularly in Europe and North America, the smart city is envisioned as a place where digital technologies are deployed to ‘solve' urban sustainability problems. Such visions have been broadly critiqued in the urban studies literature for reflecting techno-utopian, neoliberal approaches to urban development that exert corporate control over cities, but there has been little empirical verification of these critiques. More recently, a disparate and interdisciplinary body of literature has emerged documenting the impacts of smart city initiatives in practice. This paper provides a state-of-the-art, empirically informed analysis of smart-sustainability, which considers established critiques of smart city policy and visions alongside the increasing body of evidence concerning the actual experiences of smart city initiatives. Through a systematic review of the smart city literature pertaining to Europe and North America, we identify and test five tensions between the smart city and the goals of sustainable urban development. These tensions involve: (1) reinforcing neoliberal economic growth; (2) focusing on more affluent populations; (3) disempowering and marginalising citizens; (4) neglecting environmental protection; and, (5) failing to challenge prevailing consumerist cultures. On the basis of these findings we propose how digital technologists, urban developers, municipalities and citizens might address these tensions. A key finding is that the potential to empower and include citizens represents the key to unlocking forms of smart-sustainable urban development that emphasise environmental protection and social equity, rather than merely reinforcing neoliberal forms of urban development.","{Smart and sustainable?

"Del-Real, Cristina and Ward, Chandra and Sartipi, Mina",2023,"{What do people want in a smart city? Exploring the stakeholders' opinions, priorities and perceived barriers in a medium-sized city in the United States","Many cities in the United States are pursuing agendas to implement ICT-based solutions to tackle urban challenges, thus achieving the ‘smart city' label. While the discussion on this urban development paradigm has revolved around the intensive use of technologies, the academic literature increasingly calls for shifting the focus to the people living in the cities. This paper argues that to achieve a people-centred smart city, cities should include the perspectives of all the local stakeholders. Under this assumption, this paper provides the views of the local stakeholders in a medium-sized city in Tennessee, Chattanooga. Particularly, this study explores their perceived smart city concept, the ethical standards that should guide smart city projects, the desired future projects in their community, and the barriers to implementing them. The data was collected using a combination of participatory budgeting, five focus groups, and twenty-eight interviews with city dwellers, entrepreneurs, university faculty, non-profit members, and government officials. The results suggest that, far from the image of a highly technological city, the stakeholders envision a city dedicated to improving the quality of life and environmental sustainability. Furthermore, to achieve this smart city, the projects need to be based on full transparency and the promotion of social inclusion. In contrast to the dominant trend towards the privatization of urban space, this study finds that the stakeholders prefer public based smart city projects such as ICT-based public transport services. However, its successful implementation will have to overcome the barriers caused by funding constraints, public acceptance, and political interests. Cities may use the results of this study to design more responsible smart city projects that strike an optimal point between citizen engagement and technological applications and innovations while supporting all stakeholders' needs. Highlights Stakeholders' opinions on smart city projects in Chattanooga were examined Chattanooga can be considered an example of a medium-sized smart city Public-based, transparent and socially inclusive projects are preferred Preferences on smart city projects varied across groups of stakeholders Including all city stakeholders' visions can reduce social cleavages.","{What do people want in a smart city?

Finding the opportunities to innovatively use this data help governments and authorities to forecast, respond, and plan for future scenarios. Access to real-time data and information can provide effective services that improve productivity, resulting in environmental, social, and economic benefits. It also assists in the decision-making process and provides opportunities for community engagement and participation by improving digital literacy and culture. This paper aims to review and analyze current practices of data-driven smart applications that contribute to the smooth functioning of urban city systems and the problems they face. The research methodology is qualitative: a systematic and extensive literature review carried out by PRISMA method. Data and information from different case studies carried out globally assisted in the inductive approach. Content analysis identified smart city indicators and related criteria in the case study examples. The study concluded that smart people, smart living, and smart governance methods that have come into practice at a later stage are as important as smart mobility, smart environments, and smart economy measures that were implemented early on, and cities are opening up to new, transparent participatory governance approaches where citizens play a key role. It also illustrates that the current new wave of smart cities with real time data are promoting citizen participation focusing on human, social capital as an essential component in future cities.","{Implementing Data-Driven Smart City Applications for Future CitiesCities are investing in data-driven smart technologies to improve performance and efficiency and to generate a vast amount of data.

"Mutambik, Ibrahim",2024,{Culturally Informed Technology: Assessing Its Importance in the Transition to Smart Sustainable Cities,"Since the idea of the smart city was first introduced, over two decades ago, there has been an increasing focus on sustainability as a core strategic priority. However, as the relevance, importance and even definition of sustainability is a function of cultural context, planners must take account of local and regional cultural factors in the selection and adaption of digital infrastructures, as well as in the management and encouragement of public acceptance. Achieving this is not a sequential process, but a concurrent one, as these factors are interdependent. This raises the question of what factors affect and mediate the technology, choice, and public acceptance of smart sustainable cities. This paper attempts to address this question by proposing a new model which advances our current, and considerable, understanding of Technology Acceptance Modelling—using an analysis based on Structural Equation Modelling. This new model, called the Culturally Informed Technology Acceptance Model, was validated using data from a survey of residents of a variety of Saudi Arabian cities. The proposed model is designed around important factors that can be influenced by cultural context, such as digital literacy, process improvements, cost savings and privacy, and is a useful tool for understanding the role of culture in the public acceptance of smart sustainable technology. This design focus is for a number of reasons, such as helping development bodies ensure that the technologies used align with the socio-cultural context. It will also help in the management of at-scale technology roll out in a way that is resource-efficient. Although the Culturally Informed Technology Acceptance Model has been developed and validated using data from Saudi Arabia, the authors believe that it could be adapted to meet the needs of countries/cities that are looking to implement smart city strategies matched to their own distinct socio-cultural identity.","{Culturally Informed Technology: Assessing Its Importance in the Transition to Smart Sustainable CitiesSince the idea of the smart city was first introduced, over two decades ago, there has been an increasing focus on sustainability as a core strategic priority. However, as the relevance, importance and even definition of sustainability is a function of cultural context, planners must take account of local and regional cultural factors in the selection and adaption of digital infrastructures, as well as in the management and encouragement of public acceptance. Achieving this is not a sequential process, but a concurrent one, as these factors are interdependent. This raises the question of what factors affect and mediate the technology, choice, and public acceptance of smart sustainable cities. This paper attempts to address this question by proposing a new model which advances our current, and considerable, understanding of Technology Acceptance Modelling—using an analysis based on Structural Equation Modelling.

New smart cities have deepened social and digital inequalities among the technologically savvy residents and those who are usually left behind due to their age, lack of abilities, or resources. The reflective framework for inclusive smart cities offers a comprehensive and holistic approach from the perspective of who is included or excluded, what is the value of digital inclusion, and what are the key premises of inclusive digital governance. What is the implication of the main finding? The framework is meant to act as a starting point in the design of inclusive digital urban policies and strategies and can also be employed to assess the directions taken to date by city governments towards more inclusive practices. While cities on a global scale embrace smartness as a roadmap for efficient urban governance, disparities persist in the domain of digital accessibility, literacy, and skills, with manifestations of digital exclusion, ageism, and ableism prevalent in most digital urban experiences. Despite their commitment to bridging the digital divide, governments lack comprehensive frameworks to inform policymaking and action for inclusion in smart cities. This review paper aims to deepen the understanding of the multifaceted challenges confronting the governance of inclusion in smart cities. Drawing from a review of research encompassing digital inclusion, digital transitions, smart cities, and urban governance, we discuss who is included and excluded in the governance of smart cities; what are the necessary conditions to be met for smart cities to be considered inclusive; and how can smart city governance deliver public value and equal benefits for all. As a novel contribution, this paper outlines a reflective framework to inform citizen inclusion in the governance of smart cities.

Recent research highlighted that COVID-19 heightened the existing structural inequities and further exacerbated the technology-related social divide, especially for racialized communities, including new immigrants, refugees, and ethnic minorities. The intersection of challenges associated with racial identity (eg, racial discrimination and cultural differences), socioeconomic marginalization, and age- and gender-related barriers affects their access to health and social services, education, economic activity, and social life owing to digital inequity. Objective: Our aim is to understand the current state of knowledge on digital equity and the digital divide (which is often considered a complex social-political challenge) among racialized communities in urban cities of high-income countries and how they impact the social interactions, economic activities, and mental well-being of racialized city dwellers. Methods: We will conduct an integrative review adapting the Whittemore and Knafl methodology to summarize past empirical or theoretical literature describing digital equity issues pertaining to urban racialized communities. The context will be limited to studies on multicultural cities in high-income countries (eg, Calgary, Alberta) in the last 10 years. We will use a comprehensive search of 8 major databases across multiple disciplines and gray literature (eg, Google Scholar), using appropriate search terms related to digital “in/equity” and “divide.” A 2-stage screening will be conducted, including single citation tracking and a hand search of reference lists. Results will be synthesized using thematic analysis guidelines. Results: As of August 25, 2022, we have completed a systematic search of 8 major academic databases from multiple disciplines, gray literature, and citation or hand searching. After duplicate removal, we identified 8647 articles from all sources. Two independent reviewers are expected to complete the 2-step screening (title, abstract, and full-text screening) using Covidence followed by data extraction and analysis in 4 months (by December 2022). Data will be extracted regarding digital equity–related initiatives, programs, activities, research findings, issues, barriers, policies, recommendations, etc. Thematic analysis will reveal how barriers and facilitators of digital equity affect or benefit racialized population groups and what social, material, and systemic issues need to be addressed to establish digital equity for racialized communities in the context of a multicultural city. Conclusions: This project will inform public policy about digital inequity alongside conventional systemic inequities (eg, education and income levels); promote digital equity by exploring and examining the pattern, extent, and determinants and barriers of digital inequity across sociodemographic variables and groups; and analyze its interconnectedness with spatial dimensions and variations of the urban sphere (geographic differences).

The research included a field-based study in Hyderabad, a south Indian smart city, using a qualitative explorative research methodology. The research found that, although a supportive regulatory environment helps to create a positive regulatory and cognitive institutional context, normative institutions continue to discourage the positive environment that this context has created. Such a scenario may lead to a ‘talent-in and talent-out' situation that reduces the entrepreneurial potential of the cities. Thus, city governments in emerging economies need to focus on building not only a regulatory environment, but also create a conducive environment for the key stakeholders in the ecosystem to encourage and promote citizen-led IoT interventions that would result in building inclusive smart cities.","{Smart cities and the citizen-driven internet of things: A qualitative inquiry into an emerging smart cityThis paper builds on institutional theory to understand the role that the institutional environment plays in emerging economies which encourage citizens to create Internet of Things (IoT)-based interventions.

But concrete empirical evidence of this potential is visibly lacking. In parallel, researchers have brought attention to the emergence of the so-called ‘smart city 2.0'. This is framed as a decentralised, people-centric approach where smart technologies are employed as tools to tackle social problems, address resident needs and foster collaborative participation. This contrasts to the techno-economic and centralised approach of the dominating ‘smart city 1.0' or first-generation paradigm, which is primarily focused on diffusing smart technologies for corporate and economic interests. Utilising this dichotomy as an analytical framework, this paper examines Aizuwakamatsu Smart City in Fukushima, Japan to demonstrate how a smart city can be framed and implemented as a tool for tackling endogenous social challenges. Findings unearth a myriad of novel approaches to utilising data and ICT to respond to resident needs, improve livelihoods and widely share smart city benefits.

Recognising these ideological and epistemological differences (between the smart city and the urban food movement) is important for conceptualisations of 'smart food city' governance. Based on theoretical reflections, review material and findings from a European project on city-region food systems, the paper argues that smart technology can be an important part of the solution to city food challenges but in combination with social innovations to enable flexible modes of governance that are inclusive, technologically and socially-orientated and linked to specific city-region contexts.

The rapid urbanization and increasing population have put a lot of strains on city infrastructures and service deliveries. The current urbanization requires strong strategies and innovative planning to modernize the urban life. Many cities are enhancing quality and performance of urban services by being digitalized, intelligent and smarter. The policymakers and city authorities are exploring solutions to deliver the new services in an efficient, responsive and sustainable manner for a large population. The study explores all the possible services among various city dimensions which can make a city smart. The ideas related to smart services are collected from the peer vetted creative crowdsourcing process performed online in India. A directed qualitative conventional content analysis is used to analyze the collected ideas. The unique ideas are clustered into 19 different service categories. The findings suggest multi-dimensional service classification along with required basic infrastructural development. Further, the Smart City Transformation Framework (SCTF) is proposed to help the policy makers, urban developers, government officials and service providers in terms of understanding and to draw more insights from the suggested smart solutions for development of smart cities. There are four key areas (Planning, Physical infrastructure, ICT infrastructure and Deploying Smart solutions) discussed in the proposed framework to illustrate the city transformation. The proposed SCTF is supported by literature and examples adopted by various smart cities across the world to illustrate its effectiveness. Moreover, a mind map is designed to illustrate the interrelationships among the collected ideas in an attractive and procedural visualization for city transformation process.","{Moving towards smart cities: Solutions that lead to the Smart City Transformation FrameworkA city is a large and permanent human ecosystem which provides a lot of services and opportunities to its citizens.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper has taken a sincere endeavor to understand to what extent the success of the smart cities depends on the users' experience of the IT-enabled services, the backbone of smart cities, and how using IT-enabled services can improve the quality of the users' lifestyle. Initially, few hypotheses have been developed from literature review, followed by structured questionnaires. Once the data were collected, they were analyzed using different statistical tools. This paper will be useful for the policymakers, specifically those who are involved in technology and IT-governance-related areas, in policymaking for the proposed smart cities in India. Findings: This study tries to find how the IT-enabled services would transform the lives of residents both socially and technologically; to what extent the prospective citizens will be engaged to use the modern services; to what extent the threat of privacy and security issues affects the overall performance of the proposed smart cities of India; and how gaining trust of the citizens could help in successful adoption of IT services.

"Capdevila, Ignasi and Zarlenga, Mat{\'{i",2015,{Smart city or smart citizens? The Barcelona case,"Purpose – In recent years, the term “smart city” has attracted a lot of attention from policy makers, business leaders and citizenship in general. Although there is not a unique definition of what a smart city is, it is generally accepted that “smart” urban policies refer to local governments' initiatives that use information and communication technologies in order to increase the quality of life of their inhabitants while contributing to a sustainable development. So far, “smart city” approaches have generally been related to top-down processes of technology diffusion. The purpose of this paper is to present a broader view on “smart” initiatives to analyze both top-down and bottom-up dynamics in a smart city. The authors argue that these two perspectives are complementary and its combination can reinforce the collaboration between different city stakeholders. Top-down and bottom-up initiatives are not opposed forces but, on the contrary, can have a synergistic effect on the innovation capacity of the city. Both perspectives are illustrated by providing examples of different “smart” aspects in the city of Barcelona: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. Design/methodology/approach – To illustrate the arguments, the authors analyze the case of the city of Barcelona providing examples of top-down and bottom-up initiatives in four different smart city aspects: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. The research method is based on a case study (Yin, 1984). The primary data consisted on interviews to city council representatives as well as managers of local public institutions, like economic development offices, and local organizations like for instance coworking spaces. The authors interviewed also specialists on the innovation history of the city in order to validate the data. In addition, the authors used secondary data such as reports on the 22@, and documentation on the Barcelona innovation policies, as well as doing a compilation of press articles and the online content of the institutional webpages. All together, the authors have followed a data triangulation strategy to seek data validation based on the cross-verification of the analyzed data sources. Findings – The analysis suggests that the top-down and bottom-up perspectives are complementary and their combination can reinforce the collaboration between different city stakeholders. Top-down and bottom-up initiatives are not opposed forces but, on the contrary, can have a synergistic effect on the innovation capacity of the city. Both perspectives are illustrated by providing examples of different “smart” aspects in the city of Barcelona: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. Research limitations/implications – Nevertheless, the analysis has its limitations. Even if the authors have emphasized the importance of the bottom-up initiatives, citizens do not have often the resources to act without governmental intervention. This is the case of services that require high-cost infrastructures or regulatory changes. Also, as it usually happens in the case of disruptive technology, it is hard for citizens to understand the possibilities of its use. In these cases, firms and institutions must play an important role in the first phases of the diffusion of innovations, by informing and incentivizing its use. It is also important to note that some of the emerging usages of technology are confronted to legal or regulatory issues. For instance, distributed and shared Wi-Fi networks might be in opposition to economic interests of internet providers, that often difficult its expansion. It is also the case of services of the sharing economy that represent a menace to established institutions (like the tensions between Uber and taxi companies, or Airbnb and hotels). In these cases, city halls like it is the case in Barcelona, tend to respond to these emergent uses of technology by regulating to ensure protection to existing corporate services. Practical implications – In conclusion, the transformational process that leads a city to become a smart city has to take in consideration the complexity and the plurality of the urban reality. Beyond considering citizens as being users, testers or consumers of technology, local administrations that are able to identify, nourish and integrate the emerging citizens' initiatives would contribute to the reinforcement of a smart city reality. Originality/value – The contribution of the paper is to go beyond the generalized technologic discourse around smart cities by adding the layer of the citizens' initiatives.","{Smart city or smart citizens?

"Datta, Ayona",2018,{The digital turn in postcolonial urbanism: Smart citizenship in the making of India's 100 smart cities,"The smart city as a “digital turn” in critical urban geography has gone largely unnoticed in postcolonial urbanism. This paper seeks to address this gap by examining the emergence of new forms of postcolonial citizenship at the intersection of digital and urban publics. In particular, I investigate the production of a “smart citizen” in India's 100 smart cities challenge – a state-run inter-urban competition that seeks to transform 100 existing cities through ICT-driven urbanism. By examining the publicly available documents and online citizen consultations as well as observations of stakeholder workshops in four of the proposed smart cities, I illustrate how a global technocratic imaginary of “smart citizenship” exists alongside its vernacular translation of a “chatur citizen” – a politically engaged citizen rooted in multiple publics and spatialities. This takes place through three key processes – enumerations, performances and breaches. Enumerations are coercions by the state of an urban population that has so far been largely hidden from analogue technologies of governance and governmentality. Articulations are the performances of smart citizenship across digital and material domains that ironically extend historic social inequalities from the urban to the digital realm. Finally, breaches are the ruptures of the impenetrable technocratic walls around the global smart city, which provides a window into alternative and possible futures of postcolonial citizenship in India. Through these three processes, I argue that subaltern citizenship in the postcolony exists not in opposition, but across urban and digital citizenships. I conclude by offering the potential of a future postcolonial citizen who opens up entangled performances of compliance and connivance, authority and insecurity, visibility and indiscernibility across political, social, urban and digital publics.","{The digital turn in postcolonial urbanism: Smart citizenship in the making of India's  smart citiesThe smart city as a “digital turn” in critical urban geography has gone largely unnoticed in postcolonial urbanism.

Sen's framework recognizes individual variations in converting resources into valuable ‘functionings', and herein emphasizes the importance of aligning personal, social, and environmental conversion factors for individuals to fully navigate, participate in, and enjoy the benefits provided by smart cities. Adopting the capability approach and employing a cross-disciplinary analysis of the scientific literature, the primary objective is to broaden understanding of how to improve inclusivity and accessibility within smart-city societies, with a specific focus on marginalized community members facing first- and second-level digital divides. This paper underscores the importance of adopting a systemic perspective on climate-smart city navigation and stresses the importance of establishing a unified governing body responsible for monitoring, evaluating, and enhancing smart-city functionality. The paper concludes by summarizing some policy recommendations to boost social inclusion and address climate change in smart cities, such as creating capability-enhancing institutions, safeguarding redundancy in public-choice options, empowering citizens, and leveraging academic knowledge in smart-city policy formulation.","{Smart Cities for All?

Yet despite numerous examples of this 'urban labelling' phenomenon, we know surprisingly little about so-called smart cities, particularly in terms of what the label ideologically reveals as well as hides. Due to its lack of definitional precision, not to mention an underlying self-congratulatory tendency, the main thrust of this article is to provide a preliminary critical polemic against some of the more rhetorical aspects of smart cities. The primary focus is on the labelling process adopted by some designated smart cities, with a view to problematizing a range of elements that supposedly characterize this new urban form, as well as question some of the underlying assumptions/ contradictions hidden within the concept. To aid this critique, the article explores to what extent labelled smart cities can be understood as a high-tech variation of the 'entrepreneurial city', as well as speculates on some general principles which would make them more progressive and inclusive.","{Will the real smart city please stand up?

Nevertheless, this mainstream understanding of the smart city may obscure emerging new power dynamics and locally contextualised processes associated with smart urban development, especially in cities at the global periphery. Inspired by post-colonial theories, this article makes the case for ‘provincialising' smart urbanism by dislodging technology from the centre of analysis, accentuating perspectives of cities outside the locations where the smart city knowledge is traditionally produced and attending to power relationships. In our case study of Taipei, this provincialising approach helps unveil various logics, intentionalities, assemblages and power dynamics through which the smart city is employed as a political strategy to facilitate urban regime transition. We argue that the current non-affiliated Ko administration exploits the veneer of technological superiority and political neutrality of its smart city agenda to set a new growth agenda, form new development coalitions, establish new institutions and incorporate rising populist momentum into policy-making. Focusing on the politics of being smart, our findings illustrate how smart city experiments reshape power dynamics and regime formation through reorganising actors and interest groups, reconfiguring government institutions, reallocating resource distribution and, in the end, bolstering governing legitimacy.","{Provincialising smart urbanism in Taipei: The smart city as a strategy for urban regime transitionThe appeal of revolutionising urban governance through information technologies has prompted cities across the globe to pursue smart city initiatives.

Increasingly, smart cities are considered as social innovation processes to achieve sustainable and inclusive urban development, being influenced by broader socio-economic and institutional contexts of cities. This paper explores ‘smart city transitions' across varied urban contexts, in particular, how smart city transitions are enacted and how they contribute to inclusive urban transformation and public value. Using a multiple case studies approach, the research investigated infrastructure planning practices in Amsterdam in the Netherlands, Seoul in Korea, Portland in the U.S. and Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) in Vietnam, cities that were known for strong efforts to establish integrated platforms to enhance societal benefits. Our analysis showed that each city has addressed its goals around sustainability, equity and affordability by reinforcing the engagement of multiple actors with the support of integrated platforms that facilitate open and multi-directional information flow in a transparent manner. In Amsterdam, innovative solutions for sustainable use of resources have been invented and distributed through multi-level social networks, contributing to the transformation into a circular economy. In Seoul and HCMC, the city's persistent efforts to utilize an open and integrated platform resulted in proactive engagement and collaboration of public and private actors in improving quality, equity and efficiency of transit services. Portland has tackled inequitable access and mistrust issues by setting principles for data governance and facilitating equity in the adoption of innovative technologies. Our research revealed that four cities established different forms of integrated platforms such as a centrally-controlled platform and a community-centred platform in order to address specific socio-economic issues within an institutional setting of each city. We concluded that building an integrated platform is not easy, but it is a critical prerequisite for the process of sustainable transformation to truly achieve smart cities across the globe.","{Smart city as a social transition towards inclusive development through technology: a tale of four smart citiesSmart city initiatives have the potential to address many contemporary urban challenges, utilizing information and technology.

"Chong, Miyoung and Habib, Abdulrahman and Evangelopoulos, Nicholas and Park, Han Woo",2018,{Dynamic capabilities of a smart city: An innovative approach to discovering urban problems and solutions,"With the recent increase in urban population worldwide, and the emergence of big data analytics, there is a growing interest in research on how cities are actively reconstructing themselves into a smart and sustainable city. Research studies have shown that the smart city system primarily focuses on integrating three components: economic, environmental, and social. The social component includes participatory democracy with citizen engagement. In many cases, smart cities focus on discovering answers for various urban problems through the adoption of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) designed to collect citizen feedback, or provide knowledge resources that can improve the quality of urban life. However, there are very few studies that attempt to close the information loop and link problems to solutions in one, unified framework. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate such a unified approach. Using the theoretical lens of dynamic capabilities, we expand the definition of a smart city to include the notion of an urban organization with dynamic capabilities, which operates within cycles of 'sense', 'seize', ‘align', and ‘transform' functions. Our case study focuses on the 'sense' and 'seize' steps, describing a medium-size city in Texas, where an open-ended survey is used as a collection instrument for citizen input and concept-based analytics are employed to convert such input into actionable insights. Our approach has the potential to assist policy makers in designing a comprehensive strategy toward the goal of the smart city.","{Dynamic capabilities of a smart city: An innovative approach to discovering urban problems and solutionsWith the recent increase in urban population worldwide, and the emergence of big data analytics, there is a growing interest in research on how cities are actively reconstructing themselves into a smart and sustainable city.

In many cases, smart cities focus on discovering answers for various urban problems through the adoption of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) designed to collect citizen feedback, or provide knowledge resources that can improve the quality of urban life. However, there are very few studies that attempt to close the information loop and link problems to solutions in one, unified framework. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate such a unified approach. Using the theoretical lens of dynamic capabilities, we expand the definition of a smart city to include the notion of an urban organization with dynamic capabilities, which operates within cycles of 'sense', 'seize', ‘align', and ‘transform' functions. Our case study focuses on the 'sense' and 'seize' steps, describing a medium-size city in Texas, where an open-ended survey is used as a collection instrument for citizen input and concept-based analytics are employed to convert such input into actionable insights. Our approach has the potential to assist policy makers in designing a comprehensive strategy toward the goal of the smart city.",1

Through a study of seven UK smart cities, the paper investigates the framing of city problems, selection of smart verticals, and decision-making logics.

Addressing the gap of ICT skills is one of the fundamental options to grow and develop the capacity of people to effectively participate in economic activities. The general objective of this qualitative study was to explore how digital literacy skills can advance the lives of people currently searching for employment. Data were obtained using semi-structured interviews with participants who were not employed and with diverse school backgrounds. The results indicate a need to strengthen existing digital literacy programmes for NEET people. Most of the interviewed NEET people experienced challenges when seeking work on digital platforms, because they are not skilled in digital literacy. Analysis of the data from interview transcripts revealed that there is an array of challenges which prevent NEET people from efficiently using ICTs when searching for work opportunities. These include the high cost of Internet connections and the lack of knowledge of how to use these digital platforms. The study concludes that digital literacy is one of the skills which remains critical for work seekers to increase their chances of achieving continuous work opportunities, and eventually obtain employment or become employers themselves.

The results indicate a need to strengthen existing digital literacy programmes for NEET people. Most of the interviewed NEET people experienced challenges when seeking work on digital platforms, because they are not skilled in digital literacy. Analysis of the data from interview transcripts revealed that there is an array of challenges which prevent NEET people from efficiently using ICTs when searching for work opportunities. These include the high cost of Internet connections and the lack of knowledge of how to use these digital platforms. The study concludes that digital literacy is one of the skills which remains critical for work seekers to increase their chances of achieving continuous work opportunities, and eventually obtain employment or become employers themselves. It is hoped that this study will contribute to the continuous discussions about the lack of digital literacy skills among young people who are economically inactive.",1
"Couclelis, Helen",2004,{The construction of the digital city,"In this paper I discuss the digital city as a comprehensive, web-based representation, or reproduction, of several aspects or functions of a specific real city, open to nonexperts. Much more than a technical and practical issue, the digital city has dimensions that are social, cultural, political, ideological, and of course also theoretical. I explore these broader conceptual underpinnings of the digital city idea. More specifically: where do urban ideologies, urban structures and functions, and digital urban representations meet? How may the digital city relate to the real city? On the basis of what choices might the digital city be constructed? What might the digital city mean to people? To be answered, these highly involved and interrelated questions require a coherent conceptual framework. By considering an overview of digital-city realizations, issues, and critiques, I adumbrate a theory of the digital city, seen as lying at the intersection of three domains: a physical urban area, the communities of people associated with that area, and the possibilities and constraints (technological, but also socioeconomic and ideological) of the evolving information society. A rough sketch is all that can be offered at this point because proper theories of the digital city cannot be developed independently of comprehensive theories of the real 21st-century city. I close with a brief discussion of what these ideas might imply for digital-city designers.","{The construction of the digital cityIn this paper I discuss the digital city as a comprehensive, web-based representation, or reproduction, of several aspects or functions of a specific real city, open to nonexperts.

Despite efforts to promote its practice, there has been wide criticism about the concept and the way it has been adopted and implemented. The roles of various players, especially the central role of the private sector, is often challenged in the academic literature. A variety of expectations from various stakeholders make the potential implementation strategies even more complex. The current paper reviews the research in the field to date to find that there are conflicting views in smart city planning, which limit our knowledge about the ‘real' smart city and its implications for building creative and inclusive urban space. Such uncertainty at the conceptual level, and the heightened importance given by policy makers and markets to its adoption, highlights the need for proper scrutiny. The paper clusters the various views pertaining to the building of smart cities and, thereby, proposes a 3RC framework, consisting of Restrictive, Reflective, Rationalistic and Critical schools, which critically analyses various stages in the development of the field.

Current research on smart city technologies is typically focused on the areas of technology and applications. As a result, a holistic strategic framework is lacking, as partner organizations often fail to adopt and comply with the necessary interoperability standards, which can undermine the effective and rapid roll-out and transformation of smart city project strategies. This study aims to develop an ICT framework on the determinants of smart city adoption that is developed to help society and policymakers achieve the goals pursued under the smart city initiative, such as maximizing synergies between different ICT infrastructure activities and avoiding large-scale investments without increasing their potential or focusing on short-term solutions without considering long-term needs. Based on data from the literature review and expert interviews, combined with a case study of the United Arab Emirates, this paper identifies the relevant determinants, which are conceptually grouped into seven basic dimensions. For each of these dimensions, relevant sub-dimensions are specified. The framework was developed and validated through three methods: interviews with experts, a desktop study of 62 smart cities, and finally a case study of the Salik system in Dubai based on the concept of the framework. By identifying key adoption determinants, the framework provides a useful analytical perspective for policymakers and researchers involved in the strategic feasibility roll-out and transformation of smart cities.","{Hybrid Approach for Developing Strategic ICT Framework for Smart Cities—A Case Study of Dubai's Toll Gates (Salik)Information and communication technologies (ICT), systems, and people are driving innovative approaches and actions to address issues such as urbanization, demographic change, and carbon footprints of cities.

But concrete empirical evidence of this potential is visibly lacking. In parallel, researchers have brought attention to the emergence of the so-called ‘smart city 2.0'. This is framed as a decentralised, people-centric approach where smart technologies are employed as tools to tackle social problems, address resident needs and foster collaborative participation.

Utilising this dichotomy as an analytical framework, this paper examines Aizuwakamatsu Smart City in Fukushima, Japan to demonstrate how a smart city can be framed and implemented as a tool for tackling endogenous social challenges. Findings unearth a myriad of novel approaches to utilising data and ICT to respond to resident needs, improve livelihoods and widely share smart city benefits.

Results show that the COVID- pandemic has increased attention to the interactions between smart cities and the SDGs, particularly those related to health and climate action. However, it has also cemented many new unethical practices. This review highlights governance/policy challenges that should be addressed to ensure smart cities can better contribute to the SDGs. It concludes that multi-scale and transparent governance mechanisms and regulatory frameworks are crucial for ensuring that smart city solutions support the transition toward sustainable and resilient cities.",1

Insights from a quasi-natural experiment based on Chinese pilot policy,"Purpose: With the help of a quasi-natural experiment on Chinese policies, this study aims to understand the actual contribution of Smart City (SC) policies to the development of information and communications technology (ICT) in different cities. It also discusses the social and digital differences that such policies may generate, with a particular focus on the potential for exacerbating urban inequalities. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve this, the study employs a principal component analysis (PCA) to develop an ICT development indicator system. It then employs a difference-in-differences (DID) model to analyze panel data from 209 Chinese cities over the period from 2007 to 2019, examining the impact of SC policies on ICT development across various urban settings. Findings: Our findings show that SC policies have significantly contributed to the enhancement of ICT development, especially in ICT usage. However, SC policies may inadvertently reinforce developmental disparities among cities. Compared to less developed areas, the benefits of SC policies are more pronounced in economically booming cities. This is likely due to the agglomeration of the ICT industry and the strong allure of developed urban centers for high-caliber talent. Originality/value: This study contributes to the related literature by explaining the role of SC policies in driving ICT development and by focusing on the often-overlooked impact of SC policies on urban inequality. These findings can provide guidance to policymakers on the need to recognize and address existing urban inequalities.","{Does building smart cities necessarily enhance urban ICT development?

To understand the contemporary nature of a digital divide. To make connections between the digital divide and social inclusion. To think about curriculums and pedagogical reforms that flow from the use of new technologies that support digital and social inclusion for families from low socioeconomic areas. Introduction When the digital divide was first conceptualised (Gore 1998) it focused on the ‘haves' and ‘have nots' with regard to having access to computer technology or not. While access remains a contentious issue it is readily apparent that the focus eventually shifted to the quality of access to the internet via dial-up or broadband. This was because those who had access via dial-up had their actions considerably restricted by the poorer quality of the connection while those on broadband had a broader range of possibilities available to them, resulting in a new divide. Today, while access is not universal, it needs to be considered in terms of the quality of the activities that being connected to the internet via a computer, or any device, affords as well as the expectations that teachers have of their students in these new learning contexts. In contemporary times digital engagement and social inclusion are important issues of concern in globalised contexts. This chapter argues that discussions of equity and social inclusion need to consider qualitatively different types of use of new technologies. It asserts that pedagogies concerned with socially disadvantaged students need to recognise that there are qualitatively different types of activities that can be conducted with new media and support students to become fluent in all of them and not just those that fulfil the criteria for access. This means taking a new approach and creating contexts for teaching and learning that value the life experiences of students and support them to encounter, and have success with, higher levels of sophisticated activities that are respectful of their needs and interests.","Engaging the Disengaged: Inclusive approaches to teaching the least advantagedLearning objectives To recognise the characteristics of millennial kids.

China, the US and the EU each take different approaches to digital skills and literacy at home and pair them with different global engagement strategies. This paper explores the way forward for digital skills in Africa, drawing on the examples of Rwanda, Senegal and South Africa. Africa's demand for investment in digital skills and literacy is particularly high because of its rapid demographic growth and wide digital divide. But, as the continent plays catch-up with major digital powers, it is vulnerable to harms such as online disinformation, cybercrime, data breaches and digital surveillance driven by commercial and state interests. Despite the growing threats that digital technologies present for individuals and societies, African governments have mainly focused on hard skills, while less effort and resources have been invested in soft skills (eg. media literacy, ability to navigate government e-services, social skills to behave online, et cetera), which are key to navigate the internet safely and responsibly.

Using publicly available information on smart, alongside supplemental interviews, it sketches the type of smart city approach and initiatives that are taking hold in Newcastle, and explores the discrepancies between this and more abstract visions of the smart city. The chapter suggests that while Australian cities are broadly using smart as a way of retaining or driving economic growth and revitalisation, this is implemented in ways specific to each city's specific needs. By demanding that smart solutions are tailored to the specific needs of their city and by retaining ownership of infrastructure, the analysis specifically suggests the need for nuance in interpretations of the corporate role in the smart city.","Inside Smart Cities: Place, Politics and Urban InnovationThis chapter explores smart city roll-out in Newcastle, a regional centre in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales (NSW) which is rapidly becoming a showcase for smart urbanism in Australia.

"Caragliu, Andrea and {Del Bo",2023,{Smart cities and the urban digital divide,"The debate on urban smartness as an instrument for managing more efficient cities has been revolving around the notion that Smart Cities might be causing an increase in inequalities. This effect would be caused by the role played in smart urban transformations by Multi-National Corporations, which would be influencing local policymakers' agendas. In this work we empirically verify whether smart urban characteristics are associated with an increase in urban inequalities along the digital divide dimension among urban dwellers. To this aim, we exploit a large database of 181 European cities, with data on smart urban characteristics, along with measures of the digital divide obtained with the use of survey data carried out at the European Union level. Results show a negative causal relation between the level of urban smartness and the digital divide within-EU cities. Our findings are robust to a number of robustness checks.","{Smart cities and the urban digital divideThe debate on urban smartness as an instrument for managing more efficient cities has been revolving around the notion that Smart Cities might be causing an increase in inequalities.

The internet, smartphones, and various digital tools have opened up countless opportunities, connecting people globally and transforming the way we interact with the world. However, not everyone has equal access to these digital technologies, leading to a phenomenon known as digital inequality. Digital inequality refers to the disparities in access to digital technologies and the resulting gaps in opportunities, resources, and information. It encompasses various dimensions, including geographical, socioeconomic, and racial/ethnic disparities. Unequal access to digital technologies can exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities, limiting individuals' potential, and hindering societal progress. Geographically, there are significant disparities between rural and urban areas, as well as between developing and developed countries. Rural areas often lack the necessary infrastructure and internet connectivity, making it challenging for residents to access digital resources and services. Similarly, developing countries face infrastructure limitations, making it difficult for their citizens to benefit from the digital revolution.","{Digital Inequality: Examining the unequal access to digital technologies and the resulting disparities in opportunities, resources, and informationTechnologically advanced world, digital technologies have become an integral part of our daily lives, shaping the way we communicate, work, learn, and access information.

"Meijer, Albert and Bol{\'{i",2016,{Governing the smart city: a review of the literature on smart urban governance,"Academic attention to smart cities and their governance is growing rapidly, but the fragmentation in approaches makes for a confusing debate. This article brings some structure to the debate by analyzing a corpus of 51 publications and mapping their variation. The analysis shows that publications differ in their emphasis on (1) smart technology, smart people or smart collaboration as the defining features of smart cities, (2) a transformative or incremental perspective on changes in urban governance, (3) better outcomes or a more open process as the legitimacy claim for smart city governance. We argue for a comprehensive perspective: smart city governance is about crafting new forms of human collaboration through the use of ICTs to obtain better outcomes and more open governance processes. Research into smart city governance could benefit from previous studies into success and failure factors for e-government and build upon sophisticated theories of socio-technical change. This article highlights that smart city governance is not a technological issue: we should study smart city governance as a complex process of institutional change and acknowledge the political nature of appealing visions of socio-technical governance. Points for practitioners: The study provides practitioners with an in-depth understanding of current debates about smart city governance. The article highlights that governing a smart city is about crafting new forms of human collaboration through the use of information and communication technologies. City managers should realize that technology by itself will not make a city smarter: building a smart city requires a political understanding of technology, a process approach to manage the emerging smart city and a focus on both economic gains and other public values.","{Governing the smart city: a review of the literature on smart urban governanceAcademic attention to smart cities and their governance is growing rapidly, but the fragmentation in approaches makes for a confusing debate.

"Capdevila, Ignasi and Zarlenga, Mat{\'{i",2015,{Smart city or smart citizens? The Barcelona case,"Purpose – In recent years, the term “smart city” has attracted a lot of attention from policy makers, business leaders and citizenship in general. Although there is not a unique definition of what a smart city is, it is generally accepted that “smart” urban policies refer to local governments' initiatives that use information and communication technologies in order to increase the quality of life of their inhabitants while contributing to a sustainable development. So far, “smart city” approaches have generally been related to top-down processes of technology diffusion. The purpose of this paper is to present a broader view on “smart” initiatives to analyze both top-down and bottom-up dynamics in a smart city. The authors argue that these two perspectives are complementary and its combination can reinforce the collaboration between different city stakeholders. Top-down and bottom-up initiatives are not opposed forces but, on the contrary, can have a synergistic effect on the innovation capacity of the city. Both perspectives are illustrated by providing examples of different “smart” aspects in the city of Barcelona: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. Design/methodology/approach – To illustrate the arguments, the authors analyze the case of the city of Barcelona providing examples of top-down and bottom-up initiatives in four different smart city aspects: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. The research method is based on a case study (Yin, 1984). The primary data consisted on interviews to city council representatives as well as managers of local public institutions, like economic development offices, and local organizations like for instance coworking spaces. The authors interviewed also specialists on the innovation history of the city in order to validate the data. In addition, the authors used secondary data such as reports on the 22@, and documentation on the Barcelona innovation policies, as well as doing a compilation of press articles and the online content of the institutional webpages. All together, the authors have followed a data triangulation strategy to seek data validation based on the cross-verification of the analyzed data sources. Findings – The analysis suggests that the top-down and bottom-up perspectives are complementary and their combination can reinforce the collaboration between different city stakeholders. Top-down and bottom-up initiatives are not opposed forces but, on the contrary, can have a synergistic effect on the innovation capacity of the city. Both perspectives are illustrated by providing examples of different “smart” aspects in the city of Barcelona: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. Research limitations/implications – Nevertheless, the analysis has its limitations. Even if the authors have emphasized the importance of the bottom-up initiatives, citizens do not have often the resources to act without governmental intervention. This is the case of services that require high-cost infrastructures or regulatory changes. Also, as it usually happens in the case of disruptive technology, it is hard for citizens to understand the possibilities of its use. In these cases, firms and institutions must play an important role in the first phases of the diffusion of innovations, by informing and incentivizing its use. It is also important to note that some of the emerging usages of technology are confronted to legal or regulatory issues. For instance, distributed and shared Wi-Fi networks might be in opposition to economic interests of internet providers, that often difficult its expansion. It is also the case of services of the sharing economy that represent a menace to established institutions (like the tensions between Uber and taxi companies, or Airbnb and hotels). In these cases, city halls like it is the case in Barcelona, tend to respond to these emergent uses of technology by regulating to ensure protection to existing corporate services. Practical implications – In conclusion, the transformational process that leads a city to become a smart city has to take in consideration the complexity and the plurality of the urban reality. Beyond considering citizens as being users, testers or consumers of technology, local administrations that are able to identify, nourish and integrate the emerging citizens' initiatives would contribute to the reinforcement of a smart city reality. Originality/value – The contribution of the paper is to go beyond the generalized technologic discourse around smart cities by adding the layer of the citizens' initiatives.","{Smart city or smart citizens?

"Luz, Ayuns and Sheriffdeen, Kayode and Frank, Edwin",2024,"{Digital Inequality: Examining the unequal access to digital technologies and the resulting disparities in opportunities, resources, and information","Technologically advanced world, digital technologies have become an integral part of our daily lives, shaping the way we communicate, work, learn, and access information. The internet, smartphones, and various digital tools have opened up countless opportunities, connecting people globally and transforming the way we interact with the world. However, not everyone has equal access to these digital technologies, leading to a phenomenon known as digital inequality. Digital inequality refers to the disparities in access to digital technologies and the resulting gaps in opportunities, resources, and information. It encompasses various dimensions, including geographical, socioeconomic, and racial/ethnic disparities. Unequal access to digital technologies can exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities, limiting individuals' potential, and hindering societal progress. Geographically, there are significant disparities between rural and urban areas, as well as between developing and developed countries. Rural areas often lack the necessary infrastructure and internet connectivity, making it challenging for residents to access digital resources and services. Similarly, developing countries face infrastructure limitations, making it difficult for their citizens to benefit from the digital revolution.","{Digital Inequality: Examining the unequal access to digital technologies and the resulting disparities in opportunities, resources, and informationTechnologically advanced world, digital technologies have become an integral part of our daily lives, shaping the way we communicate, work, learn, and access information.

Like many other developing countries, smart projects in Morocco have been facing several challenges since their launch in 2016. The adoption of smart services requires the commitment and involvement of Moroccan citizens. This chapter focuses on a systematic literature review of the main studies dealing with factors that appear to improve end-user acceptance of services provided by Moroccan smart cities. A specific method known as PRISMA is being adopted to select and synthesize relevant studies in this field. The results obtained from the systematic review indicate that the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) is the most utilized theory in the literature. Additionally, the examination of existing studies has revealed that successful implementation of smart projects requires decision-makers to consider the following factors: performance expectancy, ease of use, social influence, perceived cost, awareness, trust in technology, and trust in the government.","AI and Data Engineering Solutions for Effective MarketingIn many developing countries, smart city initiatives are in their infancy.

"Trencher, Gregory",2019,{Towards the smart city 2.0: Empirical evidence of using smartness as a tool for tackling social challenges,"While scholars critique the first-generation of the corporate smart city for failing to tackle people-oriented agendas and authentically respond to the needs of residents, many point to a potential to move beyond narrow environmental and economic objectives and tackle social issues. But concrete empirical evidence of this potential is visibly lacking. In parallel, researchers have brought attention to the emergence of the so-called ‘smart city 2.0'. This is framed as a decentralised, people-centric approach where smart technologies are employed as tools to tackle social problems, address resident needs and foster collaborative participation. This contrasts to the techno-economic and centralised approach of the dominating ‘smart city 1.0' or first-generation paradigm, which is primarily focused on diffusing smart technologies for corporate and economic interests. Utilising this dichotomy as an analytical framework, this paper examines Aizuwakamatsu Smart City in Fukushima, Japan to demonstrate how a smart city can be framed and implemented as a tool for tackling endogenous social challenges. Findings unearth a myriad of novel approaches to utilising data and ICT to respond to resident needs, improve livelihoods and widely share smart city benefits. Yet they also point to a need to transcend polarised discourses around alternative models of smart cities and appreciate the messy reality of hybrid, on-the-ground smart urbanisation and the co-existence of contrasting yet complementary visions and approaches.","{Towards the smart city .: Empirical evidence of using smartness as a tool for tackling social challengesWhile scholars critique the first-generation of the corporate smart city for failing to tackle people-oriented agendas and authentically respond to the needs of residents, many point to a potential to move beyond narrow environmental and economic objectives and tackle social issues.

We assess that studies about citizen acceptation of SCTs have been mainly focussed on individual technologies. Also, the review shows that the field is nascent and fragmented, and that a wide variety of variables have been used to predict the adoption of individual-based explicit SCTs, with the classic ones of TAM (perceived use and perceived usefulness) unmistakably being relevant in the smart city context as well.

"Bibri, Simon Elias and Krogstie, John",2019,{Generating a vision for smart sustainable cities of the future: a scholarly backcasting approach,"Sustainable cities have been the leading global paradigm of urbanism. Undoubtedly, sustainable development has, since its widespread diffusion in the early 1990s, positively influenced city planning and development. This pertains to the immense opportunities that have been explored and the enormous benefits that have been realized in relation to sustainable urban forms, especially compact cities and eco-cities. However, such forms are still associated with a number of problems, issues, and challenges. This mainly involves the question of how they should be monitored, understood, analyzed, and planned to improve, advance, and maintain their contribution to sustainability and thus to overcome the kind of wicked problems, unsettled issues, and complex challenges they embody. This in turn brings us to the current question related to the weak connection between and the extreme fragmentation of sustainable cities and smart cities as approaches and landscapes, respectively, despite the proven role of advanced ICT, coupled with the untapped potential of big data technology and its novel applications, in supporting sustainable cities as to enhancing and optimizing their performance under what is labeled “smart sustainable cities.” In this respect, there has recently been a conscious push for sustainable cities to become smart and thus more sustainable by particularly embracing what big data technology and its novel applications has to offer in the hopes of reaching the optimal level of sustainability. In the meantime, we are in the midst of an expansion of time horizons in city planning and development. In this context, sustainable cities across the globe have adopted ambitious smart goals that extend far into the future. Essentially, there are multiple visions of, and pathways to achieving, smart sustainable cities based on how they can be conceptualized and operationalized. The aim of this paper is to generate a vision for smart sustainable cities of the future by answering the 6 guiding questions for step 3 of the futures study being conducted. This study aims to analyze, investigate, and develop a novel model for smart sustainable cities of the future using backcasting as a scholarly approach. It involves a series of papers of which this paper is the second one, following the earlier papers with steps 1 and 2. Visionary images of a long-term future can stimulate an accelerated movement towards achieving the long-term goals of sustainability. The proposed model is believed to be the first of its kind and thus has not been, to the best of one's knowledge, produced, nor is it being currently investigated, elsewhere.","{Generating a vision for smart sustainable cities of the future: a scholarly backcasting approachSustainable cities have been the leading global paradigm of urbanism.

This mainly involves the question of how they should be monitored, understood, analyzed, and planned to improve, advance, and maintain their contribution to sustainability and thus to overcome the kind of wicked problems, unsettled issues, and complex challenges they embody. This in turn brings us to the current question related to the weak connection between and the extreme fragmentation of sustainable cities and smart cities as approaches and landscapes, respectively, despite the proven role of advanced ICT, coupled with the untapped potential of big data technology and its novel applications, in supporting sustainable cities as to enhancing and optimizing their performance under what is labeled “smart sustainable cities.” In this respect, there has recently been a conscious push for sustainable cities to become smart and thus more sustainable by particularly embracing what big data technology and its novel applications has to offer in the hopes of reaching the optimal level of sustainability. In the meantime, we are in the midst of an expansion of time horizons in city planning and development. In this context, sustainable cities across the globe have adopted ambitious smart goals that extend far into the future. Essentially, there are multiple visions of, and pathways to achieving, smart sustainable cities based on how they can be conceptualized and operationalized. The aim of this paper is to generate a vision for smart sustainable cities of the future by answering the  guiding questions for step  of the futures study being conducted. This study aims to analyze, investigate, and develop a novel model for smart sustainable cities of the future using backcasting as a scholarly approach. It involves a series of papers of which this paper is the second one, following the earlier papers with steps  and . Visionary images of a long-term future can stimulate an accelerated movement towards achieving the long-term goals of sustainability. The proposed model is believed to be the first of its kind and thus has not been, to the best of one's knowledge, produced, nor is it being currently investigated, elsewhere.",1

Key challenges include addressing multiple literacies such as health literacy, financial literacy and eSafety for low-literate learners in low-resource settings with low internet bandwidth, lack of ICT facilities and intermittent electricity. Design/methodology/approach: This research implemented an educational model based on the proposed framework to train over 1,000 indigenous people using an integrated curriculum for digital literacies at remote settlements. The model uses mobile technology adapted for remote areas, context enabled curriculum, along with flexible learning schedules. Findings: The education model exemplifies a viable strategy to overcome persistent challenges by taking tablet-based digital literacies directly to communities. It engages different actors such as existing civil societies, schools and government organizations to provide digital literacy and awareness thereby improving both digital and life skills. It demonstrates the potential value of a comprehensive Digital Literacy framework as a powerful lever for Digital Inclusion. Practical Implications: Policy makers can use this transformational model to extend the reach and effectiveness of Digital Inclusion through the last mile enhancing existing training and service centers that offer the traditional model of Digital Literacy Education. Originality/value: This innovative mobile learning model based on the proposed Digital Framework for Inclusion instilled motivation, interest and confidence while providing effective digital training and conducting exams directly in the tribal settlements for low-literate learners in remote settings.

Using the 3RC framework, this paper critically analyses smart cities using experiences from Nairobi (Kenya), Johannesburg (South Africa), Lagos (Nigeria), Kigali (Rwanda) and Casablanca (Morocco). Are smart cities a panacea to Africa's quest for sustainable urbanization? Our analyses demonstrate that, if carefully planned and implemented, smart city interventions have the potential to transform the ways African cities are planned, managed, and governed. At the same time, smart city interventions in Africa are being implemented in contexts characterized by socio-economic inequalities, chaotic transport systems and massive governance failures among other challenges. We demonstrate that if ineffectively deployed, smart urban technologies might deepen existing inequalities and amplify spatial exclusion through privatization and marketization of urban space. Therefore, the adoption of smart city ideas in Africa must be rooted in contextual realities and properly calibrated to create urban spaces that are sustainable and inclusive.","{A critical analysis of ‘smart cities' as an urban development strategy in AfricaSmart cities are becoming a popular urban development strategy to address complex and multiple challenges confronting cities globally, including in Africa.

The methodological approach of this research includes a systematic review of the literature on smart cities, focusing on those aimed at conceptual development and provide empirical evidence base. The review identifies that the literature reveals three types of drivers of smart cities—community, technology, policy—which are linked to five desired outcomes—productivity, sustainability, accessibility, wellbeing, liveability, governance. These drivers and outcomes altogether assemble a smart city framework, where each of them represents a distinctive dimension of the smart cities notion.

Numerous scholars have investigated the benefits of digital literacies since 1995. The primary objective of this paper is to investigate good practices and lessons learned on how digital literacy may serve as a policy instrument for social innovation and socio-economic transformations. The empirical approach is interpretive, through an understanding of digital literacy categorized into three primary pillars: (i) the evolution and foundational concepts of digital literacy, (ii) frameworks and measures of digital literacy, and (iii) the capacity and skills associated with digital literacy. The paper also examines how digital literacy capacity and skills shape social innovation initiatives in Singapore and the UAE, impacting the socio-economic transformation of individuals, families, and communities. Our interpretive approach from field observations and policy implementation, offers a multi-dimensional perspective on digital literacy research, and its socio-economic impact on people and communities. These insights can assist researchers new to this field to gain a more thorough understanding of digital literacy's broad ecosystem and its extensive impact on communities and nations as a key driver of socio-economic change.","{Digital literacies as policy catalysts of social innovation and socio-economic transformation: Interpretive analysis from Singapore and the UAEEven before the COVID- global pandemic, the world saw the adoption and proliferation of numerous digital tools and technologies, or a global digital transformation.

Much less is known about the dynamics of their acceptance by citizens. Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature review of studies examining the acceptance of smart city technologies (SCTs), focussing particularly on Technology User Acceptance Models (TAM). Using a novel framework of SCTs based on the technology visibility and citizen interaction, we categorise them as individual-based explicit SCTs, collective-purpose explicit SCTs, digitising SCTs, and infrastructure SCTs. We assess that studies about citizen acceptation of SCTs have been mainly focussed on individual technologies. Also, the review shows that the field is nascent and fragmented, and that a wide variety of variables have been used to predict the adoption of individual-based explicit SCTs, with the classic ones of TAM (perceived use and perceived usefulness) unmistakably being relevant in the smart city context as well. As a result of the fragmentation of the field, our review was not yet able to identify generalisable knowledge about the acceptance of the smart city and its technologies by citizens.

The authors draw on interdisciplinary theory and insights from urban studies, infrastructure, informatics, and the sociology of the Internet to critique the way the 'smart city' is taken forward.

Tracking these promises and ideas, this paper explores “smart urbanism” in ten cities from all over Israel. Based on interviews with leading figures in municipalities, smart city consultants and key figures in technological companies (n = 40), the aims of this paper are to assess the efforts of cities to become smart by responding to the following questions: 1. What is guiding the decision-making process in developing technological initiatives? 2. Does context play a role in implementing technological initiatives? 3. How are the residents perceived, and what tools are being used to address residents' digital differences? The key argument of this paper is threefold: first, in the process of becoming a smart city, the roles of public and private actors are blurred, influencing the process of decision making. Second, despite contextual differences, cities adopt similar digital initiatives. Third, technological initiatives that focus on social needs and address inequality in the digital age are still at the margins. The final discussion suggests that most municipalities are still at an early stage of digitization implementation and have the ability to shape and form a vision for the cities as socio-technological ecosystems in a way that will serve their publics as a whole. The paper ends with a call for shifting the focus from the city to society in developing digital initiatives and cultivating smart social urbanism.","{From smart cities to smart social urbanism: A framework for shaping the socio-technological ecosystems in citiesAdvocated mostly by technology companies, the smart city concept promises participation, democratization and innovative urbanism.

This has important implications for the development and implementation of future smart cities. The last two decades of smart city research has presented smart cities as a generic, universal aspiration without taking into consideration such local cultural differences. Future smart cities have several tasks ahead of them. The first is selecting culturally appropriate technologies from the vast array of global technologies now on offer. The second task is adapting such technology and the third task is in managing the acceptance of such technology. The above process is not linear but must be iterative, with technology acceptance considered simultaneously alongside the selection and adoption of such technologies. This study integrates the substantial literature on Technology Acceptance Modelling into the smart city discourse to begin to address this need. It also further develops our understanding of technology acceptance using the Structural Equation Modelling Method. A new synthetic model is proposed consisting of twelve factors, which have been selected based on a targeted literature review. A survey-based method was used to develop and cross-validate the model sampling a diverse population from various Iranian cities. The result of the above process is a new model named the Urban Services Technology Acceptance Model (USTAM). The validated model includes key factors related to technology such as Self-Efficacy, Operation, Work Facilitation, Relative Advantage and Compatibility. The USTAM is a useful tool for the prediction of technology acceptance in the implementation of smart cities. The final model is significant for various reasons. Firstly, it is significant for ensuring that selected technology is appropriate to local cultural contexts. Secondly it is significant to ensure that integration of technologies at metropolitan scales is managed effectively. The final significant reason is that it is well-suited to helping developing economies participate in the smart city boom in a resource efficient manner. The proposed model can potentially help cities achieve this by guiding them in the selection of appropriate technologies. The proposed model is developed with specific reference to Iran and Bangladesh. The authors suggest that the model is useful for cities of different cultural identities and characteristics, who wish to initiate their own distinctive smart city strategies.","{Implementing citizen centric technology in developing smart cities: A model for predicting the acceptance of urban technologiesLocal urban identity, culture and knowledge ecosystems continue to shape innovative capacity and technological acceptance despite global exchange in talent, trade and technology.

Through a study of seven UK smart cities, the paper investigates the framing of city problems, selection of smart verticals, and decision-making logics. The findings highlight that the selection of smart city verticals within the case study cities is rooted in four key considerations: challenges in service delivery, pragmatism, entrepreneurialism, and broader national and global events and policy agendas. These considerations transcend different spatial scales and governance arrangements, raising questions around democratic accountability and transparency.

However, a shared definition of SC is not available and it is hard to identify common global trends. This paper provides with a comprehensive understanding of the notion of SC through the elaboration of a taxonomy of pertinent application domains, namely: natural resources and energy, transport and mobility, buildings, living, government, and economy and people. It also explores the diffusion of smart initiatives via an empirical study aimed at investigating the ratio of domains covered by a city's best practices to the total of potential domains of smart initiatives and at understanding the role that various economic, urban, demographic, and geographical variables might have in influencing the planning approach to create a smarter city. Results reveal that the evolution patterns of a SC highly depend on its local context factors. In particular, economic development and structural urban variables are likely to influence a city's digital path, the geographical location to affect the SC strategy, and density of population, with its associated congestion problems, might an important component to determine the routes for the SC implementation. This work provides policy makers and city managers with useful guidelines to define and drive their SC strategy and planning actions towards the most appropriate domains of implementation. {\textcopyright","{Current trends in smart city initiatives: Some stylised factsThe concept of Smart City (SC) as a means to enhance the life quality of citizen has been gaining increasing importance in the agendas of policy makers.

Five tensions in the visions and practices of the smart-sustainable city in Europe and North America,"Smart cities are increasingly advocated by governments and the private sector as the primary means to deliver urban sustainability. Particularly in Europe and North America, the smart city is envisioned as a place where digital technologies are deployed to ‘solve' urban sustainability problems. Such visions have been broadly critiqued in the urban studies literature for reflecting techno-utopian, neoliberal approaches to urban development that exert corporate control over cities, but there has been little empirical verification of these critiques. More recently, a disparate and interdisciplinary body of literature has emerged documenting the impacts of smart city initiatives in practice. This paper provides a state-of-the-art, empirically informed analysis of smart-sustainability, which considers established critiques of smart city policy and visions alongside the increasing body of evidence concerning the actual experiences of smart city initiatives. Through a systematic review of the smart city literature pertaining to Europe and North America, we identify and test five tensions between the smart city and the goals of sustainable urban development. These tensions involve: (1) reinforcing neoliberal economic growth; (2) focusing on more affluent populations; (3) disempowering and marginalising citizens; (4) neglecting environmental protection; and, (5) failing to challenge prevailing consumerist cultures. On the basis of these findings we propose how digital technologists, urban developers, municipalities and citizens might address these tensions. A key finding is that the potential to empower and include citizens represents the key to unlocking forms of smart-sustainable urban development that emphasise environmental protection and social equity, rather than merely reinforcing neoliberal forms of urban development.","{Smart and sustainable?

This study was done based on the results of a direct examination of official government documents using a thematic analysis approach and an analytical tool called Nvivo 12 Plus. This research was able to show what the Indonesian government's plans are and what they could do to build smart cities in the new capital city (IKN/Nusantara). The findings of this study map out six smart city support systems, which are the government's priority plans, including urban systems, safety and security, livability and urban life, government services, the environment and sustainability, and access and mobility. They all focus on technology adaptation, digitization, renewable energy, and sustainability. Despite these priority plans, there are still significant challenges to rethinking the prospects and potential for developing smart cities in the new capital city, especially the issues of human resources, budget capacity, infrastructure, and government bureaucratic adaptation patterns. This study proposes to set up a smart governance system to adapt to the new system, primarily to accommodate those problems and challenges.

This has important implications for the development and implementation of future smart cities. The last two decades of smart city research has presented smart cities as a generic, universal aspiration without taking into consideration such local cultural differences. Future smart cities have several tasks ahead of them. The first is selecting culturally appropriate technologies from the vast array of global technologies now on offer. The second task is adapting such technology and the third task is in managing the acceptance of such technology. The above process is not linear but must be iterative, with technology acceptance considered simultaneously alongside the selection and adoption of such technologies. This study integrates the substantial literature on Technology Acceptance Modelling into the smart city discourse to begin to address this need. It also further develops our understanding of technology acceptance using the Structural Equation Modelling Method. A new synthetic model is proposed consisting of twelve factors, which have been selected based on a targeted literature review. A survey-based method was used to develop and cross-validate the model sampling a diverse population from various Iranian cities. The result of the above process is a new model named the Urban Services Technology Acceptance Model (USTAM). The validated model includes key factors related to technology such as Self-Efficacy, Operation, Work Facilitation, Relative Advantage and Compatibility. The USTAM is a useful tool for the prediction of technology acceptance in the implementation of smart cities. The final model is significant for various reasons. Firstly, it is significant for ensuring that selected technology is appropriate to local cultural contexts. Secondly it is significant to ensure that integration of technologies at metropolitan scales is managed effectively. The final significant reason is that it is well-suited to helping developing economies participate in the smart city boom in a resource efficient manner. The proposed model can potentially help cities achieve this by guiding them in the selection of appropriate technologies. The proposed model is developed with specific reference to Iran and Bangladesh. The authors suggest that the model is useful for cities of different cultural identities and characteristics, who wish to initiate their own distinctive smart city strategies.","{Implementing citizen centric technology in developing smart cities: A model for predicting the acceptance of urban technologiesLocal urban identity, culture and knowledge ecosystems continue to shape innovative capacity and technological acceptance despite global exchange in talent, trade and technology.

Through a study of seven UK smart cities, the paper investigates the framing of city problems, selection of smart verticals, and decision-making logics. The findings highlight that the selection of smart city verticals within the case study cities is rooted in four key considerations: challenges in service delivery, pragmatism, entrepreneurialism, and broader national and global events and policy agendas. These considerations transcend different spatial scales and governance arrangements, raising questions around democratic accountability and transparency.

It represents the first attempt to apply Amartya Sen's capability approach by exploring the implications of digital divides for promoting inclusive and climate-friendly cities that prioritize well-being, equity, and societal participation. Sen's framework recognizes individual variations in converting resources into valuable ‘functionings', and herein emphasizes the importance of aligning personal, social, and environmental conversion factors for individuals to fully navigate, participate in, and enjoy the benefits provided by smart cities. Adopting the capability approach and employing a cross-disciplinary analysis of the scientific literature, the primary objective is to broaden understanding of how to improve inclusivity and accessibility within smart-city societies, with a specific focus on marginalized community members facing first- and second-level digital divides. This paper underscores the importance of adopting a systemic perspective on climate-smart city navigation and stresses the importance of establishing a unified governing body responsible for monitoring, evaluating, and enhancing smart-city functionality. The paper concludes by summarizing some policy recommendations to boost social inclusion and address climate change in smart cities, such as creating capability-enhancing institutions, safeguarding redundancy in public-choice options, empowering citizens, and leveraging academic knowledge in smart-city policy formulation.","{Smart Cities for All?

The key argument of this paper is threefold: first, in the process of becoming a smart city, the roles of public and private actors are blurred, influencing the process of decision making. Second, despite contextual differences, cities adopt similar digital initiatives. Third, technological initiatives that focus on social needs and address inequality in the digital age are still at the margins.

In this context, two promising phenomena have gained interest from the academia, the public sector and the media: “smart cities” and “urban sharing”. Smart cities rely on the extensive use of information and communications technology (ICT) to increase efficiencies in urban areas, while urban sharing builds on the collaborative use of idling resources enabled by ICT in densely populated cities. The concepts have many similar features and share common goals, yet cities with smart city agendas often fail to take a stance on urban sharing. Thus, its potentials are going largely unnoticed by local governments. This article addresses this issue by exploring cases of London and Berlin–two ICT-dense cities with clearly articulated smart city agendas and an abundance of sharing platforms. Drawing on urban governance literature, we develop a conceptual framework that specifies the roles that cities assume when governing urban sharing: city as regulator, city as provider, city as enabler and city as consumer. We find that both cities indirectly support urban sharing through smart agenda programmes, which aim to facilitate ICT-enabled technical innovation and emergence of start-ups.

But concrete empirical evidence of this potential is visibly lacking. In parallel, researchers have brought attention to the emergence of the so-called ‘smart city 2.0'. This is framed as a decentralised, people-centric approach where smart technologies are employed as tools to tackle social problems, address resident needs and foster collaborative participation. This contrasts to the techno-economic and centralised approach of the dominating ‘smart city 1.0' or first-generation paradigm, which is primarily focused on diffusing smart technologies for corporate and economic interests. Utilising this dichotomy as an analytical framework, this paper examines Aizuwakamatsu Smart City in Fukushima, Japan to demonstrate how a smart city can be framed and implemented as a tool for tackling endogenous social challenges. Findings unearth a myriad of novel approaches to utilising data and ICT to respond to resident needs, improve livelihoods and widely share smart city benefits. Yet they also point to a need to transcend polarised discourses around alternative models of smart cities and appreciate the messy reality of hybrid, on-the-ground smart urbanisation and the co-existence of contrasting yet complementary visions and approaches.","{Towards the smart city .: Empirical evidence of using smartness as a tool for tackling social challengesWhile scholars critique the first-generation of the corporate smart city for failing to tackle people-oriented agendas and authentically respond to the needs of residents, many point to a potential to move beyond narrow environmental and economic objectives and tackle social issues.

"Ylipulli, Johanna and Vigren, Minna",2023,"Digital Literacy and Inclusion: Stories, Platforms, Communities","The profound digitalization of everyday environments and the deep social, political, and economic implications of this development mean there is an urgent need for not just advancing but rethinking digital citizenship, as well as reconsidering different actors' roles within this new order. In many societies, digital literacy already determines individuals' possibilities to effectively function as a part of society: everyday life actions such as accessing health services and using public transport are dependent on digital literacy. However, this is just one level of the ongoing transformation. More broadly, digital technology is deeply woven into everyday practices, social interactions, cultural experiences, economic transactions, and political decision-making (Manovich 2013; Williamson 2014). This results in that digital literacy, understood mainly as a set of adequate skills that help in navigating digitalized everyday environments, needs to be accompanied by notions of broader critical awareness of technologies' role in society.

While proponents argue that smart cities will bring positive social change by the adoption of ICTs, enriched governance and human capital among the citizenry, opponents point out about the negative effects and gaps exist in their planning and execution. Despite efforts to promote its practice, there has been wide criticism about the concept and the way it has been adopted and implemented. The roles of various players, especially the central role of the private sector, is often challenged in the academic literature. A variety of expectations from various stakeholders make the potential implementation strategies even more complex. The current paper reviews the research in the field to date to find that there are conflicting views in smart city planning, which limit our knowledge about the ‘real' smart city and its implications for building creative and inclusive urban space. Such uncertainty at the conceptual level, and the heightened importance given by policy makers and markets to its adoption, highlights the need for proper scrutiny. The paper clusters the various views pertaining to the building of smart cities and, thereby, proposes a 3RC framework, consisting of Restrictive, Reflective, Rationalistic and Critical schools, which critically analyses various stages in the development of the field.

This Chapter explores the literature about Smart City and Digital City from 1993 to the end of 2012 in order to investigate how these two concepts were born, how they have developed, which are the shared features and differences between them. To accomplish with these goals, three steps were followed: (1) to set up a search strategy for systematic literature review to collect a representative subset of papers about Smart City and Digital City using Google Scholar; (2) to store the selected subset in an ad-doc database to synthesize the literature review; (3) to organize the literature review subset to extract quantitative and qualitative data and information about Smart City and Digital City evolution. The author proposes a literature review taxonomy through five specific analysis: (1) time analysis, to explore the causes of the trend of Smart City and Digital City literature in the latest twenty years; (2) terminology analysis, to examine how and where these two ideas were born and what have been the main events influenced their development; (3) definitions analysis, to select and compare the most cited and validated definitions of Smart City and Digital City trying to identify similarities, differences or overlaps between these two concepts; (4) typology analysis, to investigate if Smart City and Digital City are included into a specific urban strategy pursued by government or if they face specific urban problems without a comprehensive framework; (5) geographic analysis, to understand where are the largest concentrations of Smart Cities and Digital Cities in the world and which are their main characteristics and best practices.","{Smart and Digital City: A Systematic Literature ReviewThe concept of Smart City embraces several definitions depending on the meanings of the word “smart”: intelligent city, knowledge city, ubiquitous city, sustainable city, digital city, etc. Many definitions of Smart City exist, but no one has been universally acknowledged yet.

(2) What is new about the inequality of access to and use of ICTs as compared to other scarce material and immaterial resources? (3) Do new types of inequality exist or rise in the information society? The results of digital divide research are classified under four successive types of access: motivational, physical, skills and usage. A shift of attention from physical access to skills and usage is observed. In terms of physical access the divide seems to be closing in the most developed countries; concerning digital skills and the use of applications the divide persists or widens.

As the world becomes increasingly reliant on digital technologies, the importance of ensuring equitable access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) has become a global priority. This review explores the current state of digital inclusion efforts in two distinct regions, Africa and the USA, to understand the challenges, successes, and lessons learned in bridging the digital divide. The first section of the review focuses on Africa, where disparities in digital access are particularly pronounced. Examining various initiatives, policies, and strategies implemented by governments, non-governmental organizations, and international partners, the review delves into the multifaceted approaches taken to extend connectivity to underserved populations. It highlights the role of innovative solutions such as community networks, mobile technologies, and public-private partnerships in fostering digital inclusion across diverse socioeconomic landscapes. In the second section, the review turns its attention to the United States, where digital inclusion efforts also face challenges despite higher overall connectivity rates. By analyzing federal and local initiatives, as well as private sector contributions, the review explores the nuances of digital inclusion in an advanced technological landscape. The examination encompasses efforts to address urban-rural disparities, promote digital literacy, and ensure affordable broadband access for marginalized communities. Comparative analysis between the two regions identifies commonalities and differences in the approaches to digital inclusion. The review assesses the impact of cultural, economic, and political factors on the effectiveness of initiatives, emphasizing the need for context-specific strategies. Furthermore, it evaluates the role of regulatory frameworks and policy interventions in shaping the trajectory of digital inclusion initiatives. Drawing from the experiences of both continents, this review contributes insights to inform future digital inclusion policies and practices globally. By synthesizing the lessons learned from Africa and the USA, policymakers, researchers, and practitioners can develop more nuanced and contextually relevant strategies to bridge the connectivity gap, fostering a more inclusive and equitable digital future for all.","{Corresponding author: Benny Ehimuan Digital inclusion initiatives: Bridging the connectivity gap in Africa and the USA-A reviewThis paper provides a comprehensive overview of digital inclusion initiatives aimed at mitigating the connectivity gap in Africa and the United States.

The possession of electronic gadgets, smooth internet connectivity, and other forms of digital communication can have a wide gap in availability among countries. This gap is mostly influenced by factors that are of infrastructural, political, cultural, demographical, generational, and socioeconomic nature. On account of developed and developing countries, the gap is disseminated and thoroughly complex. Although the developed nations around the globe proved to have narrowed digital divide as a major source of development and advancement in respective countries, it is quite challenging for emerging economies to adhere to the same processes for development. For an emerging economy, the prudent cost-benefit analysis carried out by the government can have varying effects on undertaking projects related to minimizing the digital divide. Nevertheless, the importance of narrowing the gap of the digital divide is unparalleled, and governments of emerging economies are realizing the benefits of it and investing their resources accordingly. Furthermore, information technology can be a catalyst in facilitating processes that save a lot of costs, bring holistic quality improvements, and implement effective and efficient government policies that lead to digitalization and sustainable consumption of resources. Consequently, governments are getting actively involved in the digitalization of their respective countries to turn their smart cities into more intelligent ones. Even so, it is important to understand that taking one policy to address all citizens is not realistic. Hence, understanding the foundational knowledge of the citizens, the demand of the population under various sectors, framing well-rounded policies with alternatives, and effectively and efficiently implementing them are extremely crucial.","{Addressing the complexity of the digital divide and the role of government in addressing it: Role of government in bridging the digital divideThe digital divide refers to the gap among citizens of a country or across borders due to the lack of ease of access to digital means for some and the difficulty for others.

Addressing the gap of ICT skills is one of the fundamental options to grow and develop the capacity of people to effectively participate in economic activities. The general objective of this qualitative study was to explore how digital literacy skills can advance the lives of people currently searching for employment. Data were obtained using semi-structured interviews with participants who were not employed and with diverse school backgrounds. The results indicate a need to strengthen existing digital literacy programmes for NEET people. Most of the interviewed NEET people experienced challenges when seeking work on digital platforms, because they are not skilled in digital literacy. Analysis of the data from interview transcripts revealed that there is an array of challenges which prevent NEET people from efficiently using ICTs when searching for work opportunities. These include the high cost of Internet connections and the lack of knowledge of how to use these digital platforms. The study concludes that digital literacy is one of the skills which remains critical for work seekers to increase their chances of achieving continuous work opportunities, and eventually obtain employment or become employers themselves. It is hoped that this study will contribute to the continuous discussions about the lack of digital literacy skills among young people who are economically inactive.","{Capitalizing on digital literacy skills for capacity development of people who are not in education, employment or training in South AfricaMost people from rural and township areas in South Africa do not have skills in utilizing information and communication technology (ICT), particularly those who are not in education, employment or training (NEET).

"Bajdor, Paula and Starostka-Patyk, Marta",2021,{Smart city: A bibliometric analysis of conceptual dimensions and areas,"In recent years, cities are expected to develop in line with the smart city (S.C.) idea. Cities, perceived as attractive places for people to live,must now meet many conditions. A city's duty is, among others, to meet the needs and expectations of both, its residents and newcomers, offering a wide range of opportunities for entrepreneurs, caring for the natural environment, constantly taking on new challenges, and meeting them for its further development. Thus, the management of a city involves undertaking activities in line with the smart city idea. However, to implement them, they use widely available means, defined as intelligent solutions, e.g., modern ICT technologies. In line with the smart city idea, a city is a center inhabited by people who create a civic and participatory society, having the ability to use the latest ICT solutions and having access to a range of services and solutions offered by the city.

Cities, perceived as attractive places for people to live,must now meet many conditions. A city's duty is, among others, to meet the needs and expectations of both, its residents and newcomers, offering a wide range of opportunities for entrepreneurs, caring for the natural environment, constantly taking on new challenges, and meeting them for its further development. Thus, the management of a city involves undertaking activities in line with the smart city idea. However, to implement them, they use widely available means, defined as intelligent solutions, e.g., modern ICT technologies. In line with the smart city idea, a city is a center inhabited by people who create a civic and participatory society, having the ability to use the latest ICT solutions and having access to a range of services and solutions offered by the city. Since the smart city idea is considered at many levels, it is still unknown what dimensions or areas related to this concept are the most valuable and stimulating for its implementation.

This has important implications for the development and implementation of future smart cities. The last two decades of smart city research has presented smart cities as a generic, universal aspiration without taking into consideration such local cultural differences. Future smart cities have several tasks ahead of them. The first is selecting culturally appropriate technologies from the vast array of global technologies now on offer. The second task is adapting such technology and the third task is in managing the acceptance of such technology. The above process is not linear but must be iterative, with technology acceptance considered simultaneously alongside the selection and adoption of such technologies. This study integrates the substantial literature on Technology Acceptance Modelling into the smart city discourse to begin to address this need. It also further develops our understanding of technology acceptance using the Structural Equation Modelling Method. A new synthetic model is proposed consisting of twelve factors, which have been selected based on a targeted literature review. A survey-based method was used to develop and cross-validate the model sampling a diverse population from various Iranian cities. The result of the above process is a new model named the Urban Services Technology Acceptance Model (USTAM). The validated model includes key factors related to technology such as Self-Efficacy, Operation, Work Facilitation, Relative Advantage and Compatibility. The USTAM is a useful tool for the prediction of technology acceptance in the implementation of smart cities. The final model is significant for various reasons. Firstly, it is significant for ensuring that selected technology is appropriate to local cultural contexts. Secondly it is significant to ensure that integration of technologies at metropolitan scales is managed effectively.

Using a novel framework of SCTs based on the technology visibility and citizen interaction, we categorise them as individual-based explicit SCTs, collective-purpose explicit SCTs, digitising SCTs, and infrastructure SCTs. We assess that studies about citizen acceptation of SCTs have been mainly focussed on individual technologies. Also, the review shows that the field is nascent and fragmented, and that a wide variety of variables have been used to predict the adoption of individual-based explicit SCTs, with the classic ones of TAM (perceived use and perceived usefulness) unmistakably being relevant in the smart city context as well. As a result of the fragmentation of the field, our review was not yet able to identify generalisable knowledge about the acceptance of the smart city and its technologies by citizens.

Much less is known about the dynamics of their acceptance by citizens. Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature review of studies examining the acceptance of smart city technologies (SCTs), focussing particularly on Technology User Acceptance Models (TAM). Using a novel framework of SCTs based on the technology visibility and citizen interaction, we categorise them as individual-based explicit SCTs, collective-purpose explicit SCTs, digitising SCTs, and infrastructure SCTs. We assess that studies about citizen acceptation of SCTs have been mainly focussed on individual technologies. Also, the review shows that the field is nascent and fragmented, and that a wide variety of variables have been used to predict the adoption of individual-based explicit SCTs, with the classic ones of TAM (perceived use and perceived usefulness) unmistakably being relevant in the smart city context as well. As a result of the fragmentation of the field, our review was not yet able to identify generalisable knowledge about the acceptance of the smart city and its technologies by citizens.

"Fromhold-Eisebith, Martina and Eisebith, G{\""{u",2019,{What can Smart City policies in emerging economies actually achieve? Conceptual considerations and empirical insights from India,"Smart City (SC) strategies that aim at fostering sustainable urban development through the systemic implementation of modern information and communication technologies (ICTs) continue to appeal to national and municipal governments despite of increasingly skeptical academic debates. Especially in Asian emerging economies aspirations to create SCs are widespread, yet seem hopelessly illusionary in many cases and might actually harm rather than benefit most citizens. This paper acknowledges these critical views, yet also accentuates constructive perspectives on SC achievements that offer rays of hope especially for cities in less developed countries. We propose to emphasize influential process qualities of SC strategies, which can instigate broader governance and institutional transformations locally, rather than mainly looking at the technical product features of final SC settings. Refined conceptual distinctions between the product and process view on achievable outcomes of SC schemes are suggested which also borrow from evolutionary geography perspectives. To illustrate our propositions, the example of India's Smart Cities Mission launched in 2015 is used. While the planned refurbishment of urban spaces in India is rightfully criticized by some, our own qualitative empirical research – a multiple case study analysis of five SC schemes in South India in spring 2018 – reveals several promising process qualities besides implementation deficiencies. Our study finds eight mechanisms of detrimental path dependency that obstruct SC progress, but also eight mechanisms of positive evolutionary change with respect to urban governance procedures. Making agents in emerging economies aware of these potential outcomes that reach beyond a mere urban technology focus can inspire more effective forthcoming SC strategies and policies.","{What can Smart City policies in emerging economies actually achieve?

How may the digital city relate to the real city? On the basis of what choices might the digital city be constructed? What might the digital city mean to people? To be answered, these highly involved and interrelated questions require a coherent conceptual framework. By considering an overview of digital-city realizations, issues, and critiques, I adumbrate a theory of the digital city, seen as lying at the intersection of three domains: a physical urban area, the communities of people associated with that area, and the possibilities and constraints (technological, but also socioeconomic and ideological) of the evolving information society.

"Hollands, Robert G.",2008,"{Will the real smart city please stand up?

Yet despite numerous examples of this 'urban labelling' phenomenon, we know surprisingly little about so-called smart cities, particularly in terms of what the label ideologically reveals as well as hides. Due to its lack of definitional precision, not to mention an underlying self-congratulatory tendency, the main thrust of this article is to provide a preliminary critical polemic against some of the more rhetorical aspects of smart cities. The primary focus is on the labelling process adopted by some designated smart cities, with a view to problematizing a range of elements that supposedly characterize this new urban form, as well as question some of the underlying assumptions/ contradictions hidden within the concept. To aid this critique, the article explores to what extent labelled smart cities can be understood as a high-tech variation of the 'entrepreneurial city', as well as speculates on some general principles which would make them more progressive and inclusive.","{Will the real smart city please stand up?

Yet despite numerous examples of this 'urban labelling' phenomenon, we know surprisingly little about so-called smart cities, particularly in terms of what the label ideologically reveals as well as hides. Due to its lack of definitional precision, not to mention an underlying self-congratulatory tendency, the main thrust of this article is to provide a preliminary critical polemic against some of the more rhetorical aspects of smart cities. The primary focus is on the labelling process adopted by some designated smart cities, with a view to problematizing a range of elements that supposedly characterize this new urban form, as well as question some of the underlying assumptions/ contradictions hidden within the concept. To aid this critique, the article explores to what extent labelled smart cities can be understood as a high-tech variation of the 'entrepreneurial city', as well as speculates on some general principles which would make them more progressive and inclusive.",1
"Nilssen, Maja",2019,{To the smart city and beyond? Developing a typology of smart urban innovation,"The smart city is an increasingly popular topic in urban development, arousing both excitement and skepticism. However, despite increasing enthusiasm regarding the smartness of cities, the concept is still regarded as somewhat evasive. Encouraged by the multifaceted character of the concept, this article examines how we can categorize the different dimensions often included in the smart city concept, and how these dimensions are coupled to innovation. Furthermore, the article examines the implications of the different understandings of the smart city concept for cities' abilities to be innovative. Building on existing scholarly contributions on the smartness of cities and innovation literature, the article develops a typology of smart city initiatives based on the extent and types of innovations they involve. The typology is structured as a smart city continuum, comprising four dimensions of innovation: (1) technological, (2) organizational, (3) collaborative, (4) experimental. The smart city continuum is then utilized to analyze empirical data from a Norwegian urban development project triggered by a critical juncture. The empirical data shows that the case holds elements of different dimensions of the continuum, supporting the need for a typology of smart cities as multifaceted urban innovation. The continuum can be used as an analytical model for different types of smart city initiatives, and thus shed light on what types of innovation are central in the smart city. Consequently, the article offers useful insights for both practitioners and scholars interested in smart city initiatives.","{To the smart city and beyond?

Nevertheless, policy makers, city planners, and practitioners appear to have quite different expectations from what smart cities can offer them. This has led to the emergence of different types of smart cities and pathways of development. This paper aims to answer the research question: When comparing a selection of smart city projects, can we classify pathways for their implementation? We do this by using a cross-case research design of four cities to explore commonalities and differences in development patterns. An input-output (IO) model of smart city development is used to retrieve which design variables are at play and lead to which output. The four cases pertain to the following smart city projects: Smart Dubai, Masdar City, Barcelona Smart City, and Amsterdam Smart City. Our analysis shows that Amsterdam is based on a business-driven approach that puts innovation at its core; for Masdar, technological optimism is the main essence of the pathway; social inclusion is the focus of Barcelona Smart City; and visionary ambitious leadership is the main driver for Smart Dubai. Based on these insights, a classification for smart city development pathways is established.

However, the pace of innovation in smart cities seems to be much slower than the rapid and profoundly disruptive transformations brought about by digital innovation in many other domains. To develop new insights about the main causes behind this relatively modest success, this study provides a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on the connection between major smart city challenges and the essential properties of digital innovation. The review involved the qualitative analysis of 44 research papers reporting on smart city innovation practices and outcomes. The results characterize five major challenge categories for smart city innovation: Strategic vision; Organizational Capabilities and Agility; Technology Domestication; Ecosystem Development; and Transboundary Innovation. This study also explores the connections between these challenges and concrete digital innovation practices in smart city initiatives. The main conclusion is that current innovation practices in smart cities are not properly aligned with what the research literature commonly describes as core properties of digital innovation and that this might be a major cause behind the limited progress in smart city initiatives.","{A Review on Key Innovation Challenges for Smart City InitiativesSmart city initiatives are being promoted across the world to address major urban challenges, and they all share a common belief in the transformative power of digital technologies.

The analysis leads to identify Dutch regions as the Top-10 in ICT, while Greece and Bulgaria occupy the Bottom-10. Therefore, results show that the regional digital divide reflects to some extent the income gap. However, regional policy seems to be having some positive implications for technology adoption. In particular, the rural-versus-urban dimension of the digital gap appears to be less important than it is usually claimed to.

Research studies have shown that the smart city system primarily focuses on integrating three components: economic, environmental, and social. The social component includes participatory democracy with citizen engagement. In many cases, smart cities focus on discovering answers for various urban problems through the adoption of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) designed to collect citizen feedback, or provide knowledge resources that can improve the quality of urban life. However, there are very few studies that attempt to close the information loop and link problems to solutions in one, unified framework. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate such a unified approach. Using the theoretical lens of dynamic capabilities, we expand the definition of a smart city to include the notion of an urban organization with dynamic capabilities, which operates within cycles of 'sense', 'seize', ‘align', and ‘transform' functions. Our case study focuses on the 'sense' and 'seize' steps, describing a medium-size city in Texas, where an open-ended survey is used as a collection instrument for citizen input and concept-based analytics are employed to convert such input into actionable insights.

"Masucci, Michele and Pearsall, Hamil and Wiig, Alan",2020,{The Smart City Conundrum for Social Justice: Youth Perspectives on Digital Technologies and Urban Transformations,"This article employs a social justice framing to examine youth perspectives of the smart city. We examine how youth understand the impact of digital technologies on urban transformations and whether their technology skills and digital literacy give them a sense of ownership over the future of their city. Research was conducted within the context of a six-week summer educational program involving seventy-nine youth of color from public high schools in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The program mixed digital skill building with urban fieldwork to prototype solutions to long-standing urban problems: the sort of problems that smart city policies also seek to change. Our research points to a conundrum for youth. Although they embraced technological innovations, they indicated that digital technologies failed to serve the public or address pressing concerns they identified as problematic within the city: crime, drugs, and homelessness. Instead, in their view, digital technologies delivered the most benefit to private spaces in the home and workplace. Furthermore, the youth did not envision that emergent technologies would improve their neighborhoods or communities but only their employment prospects. This research suggests that the emergent smart city is reproducing actual as well as perceived urban inequities: Wealthy residential neighborhoods and spaces of the new economy become “smart,” but much of the city remains left behind. These patterns create a paradox for youth who invest in digital skills while remaining on the margins of technology-driven, smart urban change.

Increasingly, smart cities are considered as social innovation processes to achieve sustainable and inclusive urban development, being influenced by broader socio-economic and institutional contexts of cities. This paper explores ‘smart city transitions' across varied urban contexts, in particular, how smart city transitions are enacted and how they contribute to inclusive urban transformation and public value. Using a multiple case studies approach, the research investigated infrastructure planning practices in Amsterdam in the Netherlands, Seoul in Korea, Portland in the U.S. and Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) in Vietnam, cities that were known for strong efforts to establish integrated platforms to enhance societal benefits. Our analysis showed that each city has addressed its goals around sustainability, equity and affordability by reinforcing the engagement of multiple actors with the support of integrated platforms that facilitate open and multi-directional information flow in a transparent manner. In Amsterdam, innovative solutions for sustainable use of resources have been invented and distributed through multi-level social networks, contributing to the transformation into a circular economy. In Seoul and HCMC, the city's persistent efforts to utilize an open and integrated platform resulted in proactive engagement and collaboration of public and private actors in improving quality, equity and efficiency of transit services. Portland has tackled inequitable access and mistrust issues by setting principles for data governance and facilitating equity in the adoption of innovative technologies. Our research revealed that four cities established different forms of integrated platforms such as a centrally-controlled platform and a community-centred platform in order to address specific socio-economic issues within an institutional setting of each city. We concluded that building an integrated platform is not easy, but it is a critical prerequisite for the process of sustainable transformation to truly achieve smart cities across the globe.","{Smart city as a social transition towards inclusive development through technology: a tale of four smart citiesSmart city initiatives have the potential to address many contemporary urban challenges, utilizing information and technology.

"Capdevila, Ignasi and Zarlenga, Mat{\'{i",2015,{Smart city or smart citizens? The Barcelona case,"Purpose – In recent years, the term “smart city” has attracted a lot of attention from policy makers, business leaders and citizenship in general. Although there is not a unique definition of what a smart city is, it is generally accepted that “smart” urban policies refer to local governments' initiatives that use information and communication technologies in order to increase the quality of life of their inhabitants while contributing to a sustainable development. So far, “smart city” approaches have generally been related to top-down processes of technology diffusion. The purpose of this paper is to present a broader view on “smart” initiatives to analyze both top-down and bottom-up dynamics in a smart city. The authors argue that these two perspectives are complementary and its combination can reinforce the collaboration between different city stakeholders. Top-down and bottom-up initiatives are not opposed forces but, on the contrary, can have a synergistic effect on the innovation capacity of the city. Both perspectives are illustrated by providing examples of different “smart” aspects in the city of Barcelona: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. Design/methodology/approach – To illustrate the arguments, the authors analyze the case of the city of Barcelona providing examples of top-down and bottom-up initiatives in four different smart city aspects: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. The research method is based on a case study (Yin, 1984). The primary data consisted on interviews to city council representatives as well as managers of local public institutions, like economic development offices, and local organizations like for instance coworking spaces. The authors interviewed also specialists on the innovation history of the city in order to validate the data. In addition, the authors used secondary data such as reports on the 22@, and documentation on the Barcelona innovation policies, as well as doing a compilation of press articles and the online content of the institutional webpages. All together, the authors have followed a data triangulation strategy to seek data validation based on the cross-verification of the analyzed data sources. Findings – The analysis suggests that the top-down and bottom-up perspectives are complementary and their combination can reinforce the collaboration between different city stakeholders. Top-down and bottom-up initiatives are not opposed forces but, on the contrary, can have a synergistic effect on the innovation capacity of the city. Both perspectives are illustrated by providing examples of different “smart” aspects in the city of Barcelona: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. Research limitations/implications – Nevertheless, the analysis has its limitations. Even if the authors have emphasized the importance of the bottom-up initiatives, citizens do not have often the resources to act without governmental intervention. This is the case of services that require high-cost infrastructures or regulatory changes. Also, as it usually happens in the case of disruptive technology, it is hard for citizens to understand the possibilities of its use. In these cases, firms and institutions must play an important role in the first phases of the diffusion of innovations, by informing and incentivizing its use. It is also important to note that some of the emerging usages of technology are confronted to legal or regulatory issues. For instance, distributed and shared Wi-Fi networks might be in opposition to economic interests of internet providers, that often difficult its expansion. It is also the case of services of the sharing economy that represent a menace to established institutions (like the tensions between Uber and taxi companies, or Airbnb and hotels). In these cases, city halls like it is the case in Barcelona, tend to respond to these emergent uses of technology by regulating to ensure protection to existing corporate services. Practical implications – In conclusion, the transformational process that leads a city to become a smart city has to take in consideration the complexity and the plurality of the urban reality. Beyond considering citizens as being users, testers or consumers of technology, local administrations that are able to identify, nourish and integrate the emerging citizens' initiatives would contribute to the reinforcement of a smart city reality. Originality/value – The contribution of the paper is to go beyond the generalized technologic discourse around smart cities by adding the layer of the citizens' initiatives.","{Smart city or smart citizens?

Insights from a quasi-natural experiment based on Chinese pilot policy,"Purpose: With the help of a quasi-natural experiment on Chinese policies, this study aims to understand the actual contribution of Smart City (SC) policies to the development of information and communications technology (ICT) in different cities. It also discusses the social and digital differences that such policies may generate, with a particular focus on the potential for exacerbating urban inequalities. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve this, the study employs a principal component analysis (PCA) to develop an ICT development indicator system. It then employs a difference-in-differences (DID) model to analyze panel data from 209 Chinese cities over the period from 2007 to 2019, examining the impact of SC policies on ICT development across various urban settings. Findings: Our findings show that SC policies have significantly contributed to the enhancement of ICT development, especially in ICT usage. However, SC policies may inadvertently reinforce developmental disparities among cities. Compared to less developed areas, the benefits of SC policies are more pronounced in economically booming cities. This is likely due to the agglomeration of the ICT industry and the strong allure of developed urban centers for high-caliber talent. Originality/value: This study contributes to the related literature by explaining the role of SC policies in driving ICT development and by focusing on the often-overlooked impact of SC policies on urban inequality. These findings can provide guidance to policymakers on the need to recognize and address existing urban inequalities.","{Does building smart cities necessarily enhance urban ICT development?

Like many other developing countries, smart projects in Morocco have been facing several challenges since their launch in 2016. The adoption of smart services requires the commitment and involvement of Moroccan citizens. This chapter focuses on a systematic literature review of the main studies dealing with factors that appear to improve end-user acceptance of services provided by Moroccan smart cities. A specific method known as PRISMA is being adopted to select and synthesize relevant studies in this field. The results obtained from the systematic review indicate that the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) is the most utilized theory in the literature. Additionally, the examination of existing studies has revealed that successful implementation of smart projects requires decision-makers to consider the following factors: performance expectancy, ease of use, social influence, perceived cost, awareness, trust in technology, and trust in the government.","AI and Data Engineering Solutions for Effective MarketingIn many developing countries, smart city initiatives are in their infancy.

This chapter focuses on a systematic literature review of the main studies dealing with factors that appear to improve end-user acceptance of services provided by Moroccan smart cities. A specific method known as PRISMA is being adopted to select and synthesize relevant studies in this field. The results obtained from the systematic review indicate that the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) is the most utilized theory in the literature. Additionally, the examination of existing studies has revealed that successful implementation of smart projects requires decision-makers to consider the following factors: performance expectancy, ease of use, social influence, perceived cost, awareness, trust in technology, and trust in the government.",1
"Kitchin, Rob",2014,{The real-time city? Big data and smart urbanism,"Smart cities' is a term that has gained traction in academia, business and government to describe cities that, on the one hand, are increasingly composed of and monitored by pervasive and ubiquitous computing and, on the other, whose economy and governance is being driven by innovation, creativity and entrepreneurship, enacted by smart people. This paper focuses on the former and, drawing on a number of examples, details how cities are being instrumented with digital devices and infrastructure that produce 'big data'. Such data, smart city advocates argue enables real-time analysis of city life, new modes of urban governance, and provides the raw material for envisioning and enacting more efficient, sustainable, competitive, productive, open and transparent cities. The final section of the paper provides a critical reflection on the implications of big data and smart urbanism, examining five emerging concerns: the politics of big urban data, technocratic governance and city development, corporatisation of city governance and technological lock-ins, buggy, brittle and hackable cities, and the panoptic city. {\textcopyright","{The real-time city?

"Domingo, Ennatu and Muscat, Sabine and Arnold, Stephanie and Chetty, Pria",2024,{The geopolitics of digital literacy and skills cooperation with Africa Funded by the European Union,"Compared to digital infrastructure or governance frameworks, digital skills and literacy are often overlooked in geopolitical discussions. Yet, they will have a huge influence on economies and societies. Governments across the world are trying to develop a whole-of-society approach to digital literacy and skills to accelerate their inclusive digital transformation, ensure sustainable and inclusive economic growth and equip their citizens with the competencies needed to respond to future challenges. China, the US and the EU each take different approaches to digital skills and literacy at home and pair them with different global engagement strategies. This paper explores the way forward for digital skills in Africa, drawing on the examples of Rwanda, Senegal and South Africa. Africa's demand for investment in digital skills and literacy is particularly high because of its rapid demographic growth and wide digital divide. But, as the continent plays catch-up with major digital powers, it is vulnerable to harms such as online disinformation, cybercrime, data breaches and digital surveillance driven by commercial and state interests. Despite the growing threats that digital technologies present for individuals and societies, African governments have mainly focused on hard skills, while less effort and resources have been invested in soft skills (eg. media literacy, ability to navigate government e-services, social skills to behave online, et cetera), which are key to navigate the internet safely and responsibly. This paper argues that African governments do not need to reinvent the wheel to develop comprehensive digital literacy frameworks and policies. The EU-whose approach to digital literacy articulated in its DigComp Framework combines both economic and citizenship aspects-can be a key partner.","{The geopolitics of digital literacy and skills cooperation with Africa Funded by the European UnionCompared to digital infrastructure or governance frameworks, digital skills and literacy are often overlooked in geopolitical discussions.

The methodological approach of this research includes a systematic review of the literature on smart cities, focusing on those aimed at conceptual development and provide empirical evidence base. The review identifies that the literature reveals three types of drivers of smart cities—community, technology, policy—which are linked to five desired outcomes—productivity, sustainability, accessibility, wellbeing, liveability, governance.

Recent research highlighted that COVID-19 heightened the existing structural inequities and further exacerbated the technology-related social divide, especially for racialized communities, including new immigrants, refugees, and ethnic minorities. The intersection of challenges associated with racial identity (eg, racial discrimination and cultural differences), socioeconomic marginalization, and age- and gender-related barriers affects their access to health and social services, education, economic activity, and social life owing to digital inequity. Objective: Our aim is to understand the current state of knowledge on digital equity and the digital divide (which is often considered a complex social-political challenge) among racialized communities in urban cities of high-income countries and how they impact the social interactions, economic activities, and mental well-being of racialized city dwellers. Methods: We will conduct an integrative review adapting the Whittemore and Knafl methodology to summarize past empirical or theoretical literature describing digital equity issues pertaining to urban racialized communities. The context will be limited to studies on multicultural cities in high-income countries (eg, Calgary, Alberta) in the last 10 years. We will use a comprehensive search of 8 major databases across multiple disciplines and gray literature (eg, Google Scholar), using appropriate search terms related to digital “in/equity” and “divide.” A 2-stage screening will be conducted, including single citation tracking and a hand search of reference lists. Results will be synthesized using thematic analysis guidelines. Results: As of August 25, 2022, we have completed a systematic search of 8 major academic databases from multiple disciplines, gray literature, and citation or hand searching. After duplicate removal, we identified 8647 articles from all sources. Two independent reviewers are expected to complete the 2-step screening (title, abstract, and full-text screening) using Covidence followed by data extraction and analysis in 4 months (by December 2022).

"Bibri, Simon Elias and Krogstie, John",2019,{Generating a vision for smart sustainable cities of the future: a scholarly backcasting approach,"Sustainable cities have been the leading global paradigm of urbanism. Undoubtedly, sustainable development has, since its widespread diffusion in the early 1990s, positively influenced city planning and development. This pertains to the immense opportunities that have been explored and the enormous benefits that have been realized in relation to sustainable urban forms, especially compact cities and eco-cities. However, such forms are still associated with a number of problems, issues, and challenges. This mainly involves the question of how they should be monitored, understood, analyzed, and planned to improve, advance, and maintain their contribution to sustainability and thus to overcome the kind of wicked problems, unsettled issues, and complex challenges they embody. This in turn brings us to the current question related to the weak connection between and the extreme fragmentation of sustainable cities and smart cities as approaches and landscapes, respectively, despite the proven role of advanced ICT, coupled with the untapped potential of big data technology and its novel applications, in supporting sustainable cities as to enhancing and optimizing their performance under what is labeled “smart sustainable cities.” In this respect, there has recently been a conscious push for sustainable cities to become smart and thus more sustainable by particularly embracing what big data technology and its novel applications has to offer in the hopes of reaching the optimal level of sustainability. In the meantime, we are in the midst of an expansion of time horizons in city planning and development. In this context, sustainable cities across the globe have adopted ambitious smart goals that extend far into the future. Essentially, there are multiple visions of, and pathways to achieving, smart sustainable cities based on how they can be conceptualized and operationalized. The aim of this paper is to generate a vision for smart sustainable cities of the future by answering the 6 guiding questions for step 3 of the futures study being conducted. This study aims to analyze, investigate, and develop a novel model for smart sustainable cities of the future using backcasting as a scholarly approach. It involves a series of papers of which this paper is the second one, following the earlier papers with steps 1 and 2. Visionary images of a long-term future can stimulate an accelerated movement towards achieving the long-term goals of sustainability. The proposed model is believed to be the first of its kind and thus has not been, to the best of one's knowledge, produced, nor is it being currently investigated, elsewhere.","{Generating a vision for smart sustainable cities of the future: a scholarly backcasting approachSustainable cities have been the leading global paradigm of urbanism.

Smart cities are seen as evolving ecosystems in which multiple actors act, react and interact over time to foster innovative solutions and provide better services for citizens. Despite the growing interest, existing research has to make key advances, important gaps persist as scholars lag behind theoretical development and rarely take into account the most important element of a city: people. Business and management scholars have focused on how to define strategies in smart cities, local policy, and others investigated the challenges of building a smart city. Few concerns deal with humans. In addressing these shortcomings, we tried to highlight why any smart city should be a community that learns, adapts, co-creates, and innovates. The purpose of this study is to investigate the human perspective that goes beyond the focus on technology related to smart cities in Europe, through an analysis in depth on how and how much citizens make cities smart. The focus is on people and their well-being combined with the shared knowledge and development that arises from each player in the ecosystem.

The results are presented with respect to each smart city characteristic. As expected, most strategies emphasize the role of information and communication technologies in improving the functionality of urban systems and advancing knowledge transfer and innovation networks.

Addressing the gap of ICT skills is one of the fundamental options to grow and develop the capacity of people to effectively participate in economic activities. The general objective of this qualitative study was to explore how digital literacy skills can advance the lives of people currently searching for employment. Data were obtained using semi-structured interviews with participants who were not employed and with diverse school backgrounds. The results indicate a need to strengthen existing digital literacy programmes for NEET people. Most of the interviewed NEET people experienced challenges when seeking work on digital platforms, because they are not skilled in digital literacy. Analysis of the data from interview transcripts revealed that there is an array of challenges which prevent NEET people from efficiently using ICTs when searching for work opportunities. These include the high cost of Internet connections and the lack of knowledge of how to use these digital platforms. The study concludes that digital literacy is one of the skills which remains critical for work seekers to increase their chances of achieving continuous work opportunities, and eventually obtain employment or become employers themselves. It is hoped that this study will contribute to the continuous discussions about the lack of digital literacy skills among young people who are economically inactive.","{Capitalizing on digital literacy skills for capacity development of people who are not in education, employment or training in South AfricaMost people from rural and township areas in South Africa do not have skills in utilizing information and communication technology (ICT), particularly those who are not in education, employment or training (NEET).

Due to its lack of definitional precision, not to mention an underlying self-congratulatory tendency, the main thrust of this article is to provide a preliminary critical polemic against some of the more rhetorical aspects of smart cities. The primary focus is on the labelling process adopted by some designated smart cities, with a view to problematizing a range of elements that supposedly characterize this new urban form, as well as question some of the underlying assumptions/ contradictions hidden within the concept. To aid this critique, the article explores to what extent labelled smart cities can be understood as a high-tech variation of the 'entrepreneurial city', as well as speculates on some general principles which would make them more progressive and inclusive.","{Will the real smart city please stand up?

Five tensions in the visions and practices of the smart-sustainable city in Europe and North America,"Smart cities are increasingly advocated by governments and the private sector as the primary means to deliver urban sustainability. Particularly in Europe and North America, the smart city is envisioned as a place where digital technologies are deployed to ‘solve' urban sustainability problems. Such visions have been broadly critiqued in the urban studies literature for reflecting techno-utopian, neoliberal approaches to urban development that exert corporate control over cities, but there has been little empirical verification of these critiques. More recently, a disparate and interdisciplinary body of literature has emerged documenting the impacts of smart city initiatives in practice. This paper provides a state-of-the-art, empirically informed analysis of smart-sustainability, which considers established critiques of smart city policy and visions alongside the increasing body of evidence concerning the actual experiences of smart city initiatives. Through a systematic review of the smart city literature pertaining to Europe and North America, we identify and test five tensions between the smart city and the goals of sustainable urban development. These tensions involve: (1) reinforcing neoliberal economic growth; (2) focusing on more affluent populations; (3) disempowering and marginalising citizens; (4) neglecting environmental protection; and, (5) failing to challenge prevailing consumerist cultures. On the basis of these findings we propose how digital technologists, urban developers, municipalities and citizens might address these tensions. A key finding is that the potential to empower and include citizens represents the key to unlocking forms of smart-sustainable urban development that emphasise environmental protection and social equity, rather than merely reinforcing neoliberal forms of urban development.","{Smart and sustainable?

",2024,A Digital Transformation Framework for Smart Municipalities,"Smart cities, as defined by Sustainable Development Goal 11, strive to make cities more inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. Digital technologies addresses urbanisation concerns, such as rising energy use, pollution, waste disposal, and social inequities. The Internet of Things (IoT) and data-driven technologies are essential drivers, with a focus on infrastructure and decision-making in smart cities and municipalities. Digital Transformation (DT) is a prerequisite for becoming a Smart Municipality. The research objective of this paper is to investigate the role of digital technologies in improving urban processes, focusing on Smart City dimensions for municipalities, namely smart governance, environment, living, and technology. Municipalities in South Africa, particularly in the Eastern Cape, used digital adoption to boost productivity and skill development. However, the need for standardised DT principles presents problems for transitioning municipalities into data-driven organisations. The paper also examines the global energy issue and how smart cities can contribute to energy solutions. Finally, the paper addresses the following research question: ‘How can lessons learned from the Eastern Cape Municipalities digital adoption be scaled to other developing nations facing similar challenges in energy management and urban planning?’ Using a survey method, it provides guidelines in the DT framework, offering empirical insights into Smart Municipality digitalisation.","A Digital Transformation Framework for Smart MunicipalitiesSmart cities, as defined by Sustainable Development Goal , strive to make cities more inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable.

Using the 3RC framework, this paper critically analyses smart cities using experiences from Nairobi (Kenya), Johannesburg (South Africa), Lagos (Nigeria), Kigali (Rwanda) and Casablanca (Morocco). Are smart cities a panacea to Africa's quest for sustainable urbanization? Our analyses demonstrate that, if carefully planned and implemented, smart city interventions have the potential to transform the ways African cities are planned, managed, and governed. At the same time, smart city interventions in Africa are being implemented in contexts characterized by socio-economic inequalities, chaotic transport systems and massive governance failures among other challenges. We demonstrate that if ineffectively deployed, smart urban technologies might deepen existing inequalities and amplify spatial exclusion through privatization and marketization of urban space. Therefore, the adoption of smart city ideas in Africa must be rooted in contextual realities and properly calibrated to create urban spaces that are sustainable and inclusive.","A critical analysis of ‘smart cities’ as an urban development strategy in AfricaSmart cities are becoming a popular urban development strategy to address complex and multiple challenges confronting cities globally, including in Africa.

However, one of the most recent urban development models (smart city concept) envisioned as appropriate solution and promoted as conduit to good quality of life and socio-economic efficiency has been criticised on the ground of its economic imperative and over dependency on highly skilled digital platform to be successful. In this paper, the author proposes sharing city concept as African alternative and supplement to smart city concept. Using smart city potentials and urban challenges discussed around it, the paper adopted a systematic literature review design and evaluated sharing city concept against the backdrop outlined by smart city opponents and urban challenges peculiar to it.

However, while SC has enhanced the living conditions of city dwellers in the developed world, the concept is still either missing or poorly deployed in the developing world. This paper presents a review of the SC concept from the perspective of its application to cities in developing nations, the opportunities it avails, and challenges related to its applicability to these cities. Building upon a systematic review of literature, this paper shows that there are neither canonical definitions, models or frameworks of references for the SC concept.

Drawing inspiration from other authors, we propose a conceptual model for a SC initiative in Africa and demonstrate the need to prioritize research and capacity development. We also discuss the potential opportunities for such SC implementations in sub-Saharan Africa. As a case study, we consider the city of Lubumbashi in the Democratic Republic of Congo and discuss ways of making it a smart city by building around successful smart city initiatives. It is our belief that for Lubumbashi, as with any other city in Sub-Saharan Africa, the first step to developing a smart city is to build knowledge and create an intellectual capital.","Smart Cities and Villages: Concept Review and Implementation Perspectives in Developing CitiesThe""Smart City""(SC) concept has been around for decades with deployment scenarios revealed in major cities of developed countries.

G. Mboup,2017,Smart Infrastructure Development Makes Smart Cities—Promoting Smart Transport and ICT in Dakar,"A smart city is viewed as a sustainable, inclusive and prosperous city that promotes a people-centric approach based on three core components and seven dimensions. The three core components are Smart City Foundation, Smart ICT and Smart Institutions and Laws, which in turn are the pillars of the seven dimensions of a smart city: Infrastructure Development, Environmental Sustainability, Social Development, Social Inclusion, Disasters Exposure, Resilience, and Peace and Security. The three components together with the seven dimensions make a Smart Economy. Infrastructure development has several elements across various social, economic and environmental dimensions. Here, our analysis focuses on those connecting people to several categories of services, particularly transport and ICT infrastructures. The first section analyses the classical option of connecting people to services through non-motorized means or motorized means of transport. The interaction between the development of urban spatial patterns and transport is thus a key factor shaping accessibility in cities both in physical and in socioeconomic terms. To access to services such as work, to the health centers, to the school or to the market among several other destinations, the share of motorized means is 40 % (public an private) compared to 60 % for the non-motorized means, mainly by walking. The public transport sector is predominantly informal (95 % against 5 % for the formal sector). Turning informal transport sector challenges to opportunities in the smart city making is a call along with the enhancement of the public sector with the introduction of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and other higher efficient means of public transport. In the absence of affordable, reliable public transport, the poor are no choice rather walking to access to services. It is urgent to make streets friendly to pedestrians with sufficient public spaces for social interactions. Today, it is recognized that the information and communication technology (ICT) development is an important enabler of accessing to services and must be integrated in the planning and management of transport systems. For these past 15 years, the Senegalese government has taken various steps to create an environment favorable to the development and use of ICT at all levels.

They clearly stated that they are choosing smart development as the underlying concept for their future growth as a way to foster economic development in smart way to avoid the paths of rapid industrialization and pollution of cities as it took place in Europe and United States. The first of these smart cities, Dholera, is already under construction and it attracts journalists and urban planners from all over the world. The aim of this paper is to critically discuss the theoretical backgrounds and the practices of smart cities and examine the ways the concept is implemented. The paper is based on thorough study of literature and examining the two case studies of Dholera (India) and Songdo (South Korea). Smart city is a contested concept without a unified definition. It stems from the idea of digital and information city promoted using information and communication technologies (ICT) to develop cities. By installation of ICT municipalities obtain large sets of data which are then transformed into effective urban policies. One of the pilot projects of this kind was Rio de Janeiro and building the Center of Operations by IBM Company. City made a great investment into the smart information system before two huge events took place – FIFA World Cup in 2014 and Olympic Games in 2016. The project raised many questions including whether and how it improved the life of its citizens and in what way it made the city smart. The other definition of smart city is the idea of smartness in city development in broader sense. It focuses on smart use of resources, smart and effective management and smart social inclusion. Within this view, the ICTs are one component of the concept, by no means its bread and butter. Technologies can be used in a variety of ways. Problem occurs when smart city is viewed as means to make investments from city budgets by any price, by promoting use of smart technologies as the only way forward, as necessity.
