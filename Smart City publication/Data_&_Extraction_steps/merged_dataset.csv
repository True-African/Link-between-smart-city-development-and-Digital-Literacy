"Chew, Zheng Jun and Zhu, Meiling",2015.0,2015 IEEE SENSORS - Proceedings,"A batteryless power management circuit incorporating an energy aware interface (EAI) for wireless sensor nodes (WSNs) powered by piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) has been proposed and implemented. Traditional power management usually requires two DC-DC converters, each for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and voltage regulation functionalities. The proposed circuit requires only one DC-DC converter for both the MPPT and voltage regulation. The EAI also provides a means to voltage regulation. This allows the circuit to have higher efficiency as the energy transfer does not have to go through two stages to reach the load. A PEH connected to the proposed circuit was tested under various vibration conditions. The circuit was found to have end-to-end efficiency of about 66% under most of the test conditions.",https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSENS.2015.7370663,inproceedings

Africa's urban population is growing much faster than in Europe and is expected to surpass the rural population by 2050, when city will increase to 62% [1] and even today about 30% of citizens have no access to electricity or heating fuels. [2] The new global sustainable development goals has set as a target [3] universal access to affordable, reliable energy, and sustainable for 2030 [4]. In the implementation of Smart Cities, Africa must not be left behind: promote fair, resilient and sustainable energy systems, responsible energy industries and access for the poor to clean energy, efficient and affordable services, must be a priority also for the European Community. Access to green energy and electricity, is crucial for reducing poverty and driving sustainable economic development, it is necessary an innovative and long-term sustainable approach to design energy services to meet the needs of people living in energy poverty and not only. Africa will be 'the next big market' due to the rapid growth of emerging economies. Smart cities in Africa will be a challenge for the energy supply, use of renewable sources, a better quality of life, reduced energy consumption, less environmental impact. The key elements to achieve sustainability in developing countries will be the introduction of smart grids, smart metering, the Internet of Things (IoT), dissemination of information and communication technology (ICT): a new vision in which the citizen becomes a hub, being both consumer and producer of green energy, renewable energy spread widely in the area (solar, hydro, wind), through integration in smart grid.

Like many other developing countries, smart projects in Morocco have been facing several challenges since their launch in 2016. The adoption of smart services requires the commitment and involvement of Moroccan citizens. This chapter focuses on a systematic literature review of the main studies dealing with factors that appear to improve end-user acceptance of services provided by Moroccan smart cities. A specific method known as PRISMA is being adopted to select and synthesize relevant studies in this field. The results obtained from the systematic review indicate that the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) is the most utilized theory in the literature. Additionally, the examination of existing studies has revealed that successful implementation of smart projects requires decision-makers to consider the following factors: performance expectancy, ease of use, social influence, perceived cost, awareness, trust in technology, and trust in the government.",https://doi.org/10.4018/979-8-3693-3172-9.ch006,incollection

"Kiberu, Vincent M. and Mars, Maurice and Scott, Richard E.",2017.0,African Journal of Primary Health Care and Family Medicine,"Background: Most developing countries, including Uganda, have embraced the use of e-Health and m-Health applications as a means to improve primary healthcare delivery and public health for their populace. In Uganda, the growth in the information and communications technology industry has benefited the rural communities and also created opportunities for new innovations, and their application into healthcare has reported positive results, especially in the areas of disease control and prevention through disease surveillance. However, most are mere proof-of-concepts, only demonstrated in use within a small context and lack sustainability. This study reviews the literature to understand e-Health's current implementation status within Uganda and documents the barriers and opportunities to sustainable e-Health intervention programmes in Uganda. Methods: A structured literature review of e-Health in Uganda was undertaken between May and December 2015 and was complemented with hand searching and a document review of grey literature in the form of policy documents and reports obtained online or from the Ministry of Health's Resource Centre. Results: The searches identified a total of 293 resources of which 48 articles met the inclusion criteria of being in English and describing e-Health implementation in Uganda. These were included in the study and were examined in detail. Conclusion: Uganda has trialled several e-Health and m-Health solutions to address healthcare challenges. Most were donor funded, operated in silos and lacked sustainability. Various barriers have been identified. Evidence has shown that e-Health implementations in Uganda have lacked prior planning stages that the literature notes as essential, for example strategy and need readiness assessment. Future research should address these shortcomings prior to introduction of e-Health innovations.",https://doi.org/10.4102/phcfm.v9i1.1277,misc

"GOLDSTEIN, Brett and DYSON, Lauren",2013.0,Beyond Transparency - Open Data and Future of Civic Innovation,"In 2005, I was working at TriMet, the public transit agency in Port- land, Oregon, as an IT manager for Geographic Information Services. Earlier that year, while traveling, I found it very frustrating to try and find transit directions in the unfamiliar cities I was visiting. This was especially true when transportation agencies that provided differing services or areas were not consolidated. It was much easier at that time to get driving directions from popular online mapping services, and I realized this was probably encouraging car usage over public transit. In my role at TriMet, I worked with transit data every day, so I knew such data was available and the potential was there. We offered our own online transit trip planning tool, as many agencies do. The trouble was, the average citizen often didn't know where to go to find this in- formation, especially if he or she was unfamiliar with the local transit system. The general public was used to going to certain online desti- nations for driving directions—Google Maps, MapQuest, and Yahoo were all widely used at the time—but the data they needed to plan a trip using public transit wasn't available where they were looking.

"Foxcroft, Llewellyn C. and van Wilgen, Brian W. and Abrahams, Brent and Esler, Karen J. and Wannenburgh, Andrew",2020.0,Biological Invasions in South Africa,"Increasing resources are being allocated both to the management and research of biological invasions in South Africa. However, as with many natural resource management and conservation programmes globally, the question remains as to what extent the science provides the necessary answers for management, and whether it influences decision-making. This frequently presents as a gap between knowledge generation and application of research outcomes (‘knowing-doing gap'). The ideal scenario, a two-way transfer of knowledge along a continuum between science and management (‘knowing-doing continuum'), would allow for dialogue between all role-players that will not only transfer research results in support of management, but communicate management needs to scientists. This chapter explores how well this continuum has operated in South Africa with regard to biological invasions. Professionals employed in different positions along a continuum of basic or applied research to technology transfer and implementation are currently assessed with different performance measures. This drives different behaviours, which in turn can impede smooth integration. To counteract this, different types of communication structures have been developed, although many have not persisted. The most successful and enduring appear to be voluntary forums or conference series where researchers and managers are regularly exposed to each other's challenges. Scientists who are embedded within management agencies (for example, Scientific Services units within national parks and provincial conservation agencies) appear to be well-placed to bridge the gaps that exist, but mechanisms to evolve into a true knowing-doing continuum still need to be sought for the South African context. To be more relevant, researchers need to draw on the experience of managers, better understand the context within which managers operate, and by which they are constrained, while policy-makers may have to become more willing to adapt approaches when research suggests that such changes would be warranted if certain goals are to be achieved.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-32394-3_28,incollection
"Szreter, Simon",2004.0,British Medical Bulletin,"Throughout history and prehistory trade and economic growth have always entailed serious population health challenges. The post-war orthodoxies of demographic and epidemiological transition theory and the Washington consensus have each encouraged the view that industrialization necessarily changes all this and that modern forms of rapid economic growth will reliably deliver enhanced population health. A more careful review of the historical demographic and anthropometric evidence demonstrates that this is empirically false, and a fallacious oversimplification. All documented developed nations endured the 'four Ds' of disruption, deprivation, disease and death during their historic industrializations. The well-documented British historical case is reviewed in detail to examine the principal factors involved. This shows that political and ideological divisions and conflict-and their subsequent resolution in favour of the health interests of the working-class majorities-were key factors in determining whether industrialization exerted a positive or negative net effect on population health.",https://doi.org/10.1093/bmb/ldh005,misc

The disease is very common in Africa including Ethiopia. Schistosoma mansoni is a major public health problem in Ethiopia especially among children. This review is aimed to indicate the prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni among children at the national and regional levels. Methods and material: The PRISMA guidelines were followed. An electronic search of PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, MEDLINE, and Google search were carried out using key terms. Articles published from the proceeding of professional associations such as the Ethiopian medical laboratory association, the Ethiopian public health association, and annual national research conferences were also searched to find additional eligible studies. Data were extracted independently by two investigators, and cross-checked by a third reviewer. The quality of included studies was assessed using JBI quality assessment criteria. Data were extracted using Microsoft excel and finally analyzed using STATA version 12. The pooled prevalence was done using a random-effects model. Result: Overall 49 studies involving 20,493 children (10,572 male and 9, 921 females) were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni infection was 37.13% (95%CI:30.02–44.24). High heterogeneity was observed with I2 of 99.4%, P < 0.000. According to subgroup analysis, the pooled prevalence was high in the SNNPR (41.49%: 95%CI: 19.52–63.46) followed by the Amhara region (41.11%: 95%CI: 30.41–51.8), the Tigray region (31.40%: 95%CI:11.72–51.09), and the Oromia region (28.98%: 95%CI: 18.85–39.1). Year from 2011 to 2015 contributed to the highest prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni infection among children (46.31%: 95%:34.21–59.05).

In this context, smart city infrastructure plays an important role in enabling new ways of measuring, experiencing and engaging with local and temporal dynamics of urban systems.

"Martin, Alicia R. and Teferra, Solomon and M{\""{o",2018.0,Current Opinion in Genetics and Development,"Human genetic studies have long been vastly Eurocentric, raising a key question about the generalizability of these study findings to other populations. Because humans originated in Africa, these populations retain more genetic diversity, and yet individuals of African descent have been tremendously underrepresented in genetic studies. The diversity in Africa affords ample opportunities to improve fine-mapping resolution for associated loci, discover novel genetic associations with phenotypes, build more generalizable genetic risk prediction models, and better understand the genetic architecture of complex traits and diseases subject to varying environmental pressures. Thus, it is both ethically and scientifically imperative that geneticists globally surmount challenges that have limited progress in African genetic studies to date. Additionally, African investigators need to be meaningfully included, as greater inclusivity and enhanced research capacity afford enormous opportunities to accelerate genomic discoveries that translate more effectively to all populations. We review the advantages, challenges, and examples of genetic architecture studies of complex traits and diseases in Africa. For example, with greater genetic diversity comes greater ancestral heterogeneity; this higher level of understudied diversity can yield novel genetic findings, but some methods that assume homogeneous population structure and work well in European populations may work less well in the presence of greater heterogeneity in African populations. Consequently, we advocate for methodological development that will accelerate studies important for all populations, especially those currently underrepresented in genetics.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gde.2018.08.005,misc

"Evans, Olaniyi",2018.0,"Digital Policy, Regulation and Governance ","Purpose: The increased adoption of internet-enabled phones in Africa has caused much speculation and optimism concerning its effects on financial inclusion. Policymakers, the media and various studies have all flaunted the potentials of internet and mobile phones for financial inclusion. An important question therefore is “Can the internet and mobile phones spur the inclusion of the financially excluded poor? This study therefore aims to examine the relationship and causality between internet, mobile phones and financial inclusion in Africa for the 2000-2016 period. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical analysis followed these three steps: examination of the stationarity of the variables; testing for the cointegration; and evaluation of the effects of the internet and mobile phones on financial inclusion in Africa for the 2000-2016 period using three outcomes of panel FMOLS approach and Granger causality tests. Findings: The empirical evidence shows that internet and mobile phones have significant positive relationship with financial inclusion, meaning that rising levels of internet and mobile phones are associated with increased financial inclusion. There is also uni-directional causality from internet and mobile phones to financial inclusion, implying that internet and mobile phones cause financial inclusion. The study also shows that macroeconomic factors such as capital formation, primary enrollment, bank credit, broad money, population growth, remittances, agriculture and interest rate, as well as institutional factors such as regulatory quality are important underlying factors for financial inclusion in Africa. Originality/value: In the literature, there is a dearth of research on the internet, mobile phones and financial inclusion, especially in Africa. Most of the related studies are conceptual and micro-based, with little empirical attention to the relationship and causality between internet, mobile phones and financial inclusion. In fact, this dearth of rigorous empirical studies has been attributed as the main cause of inadequate policy guidance in enhancing information communication technologies (Roycroft and Anantho, 2003), despite saturation levels in developed economies. This study fills the gap by evaluating the effects of the Internet and mobile phones on financial inclusion for 44 African countries for the 2000-2016 period.",https://doi.org/10.1108/DPRG-04-2018-0018,misc

Interest in the use of AI for urban innovation continues to grow. Particularly, the rise of smart cities—urban locations that are enabled by community, technology, and policy to deliver productivity, innovation, livability, wellbeing, sustainability, accessibility, good governance, and good planning—has increased the demand for AI-enabled innovations. There is, nevertheless, no scholarly work that provides a comprehensive review on the topic. This paper generates insights into how AI can contribute to the development of smarter cities. A systematic review of the literature is selected as the methodologic approach. Results are categorized under the main smart city development dimensions, i.e., economy, society, environment, and governance. The findings of the systematic review containing 93 articles disclose that: (a) AI in the context of smart cities is an emerging field of research and practice. (b) The central focus of the literature is on AI technologies, algorithms, and their current and prospective applications. (c) AI applications in the context of smart cities mainly concentrate on business efficiency, data analytics, education, energy, environmental sustainability, health, land use, security, transport, and urban management areas.

To understand the contemporary nature of a digital divide. To make connections between the digital divide and social inclusion. To think about curriculums and pedagogical reforms that flow from the use of new technologies that support digital and social inclusion for families from low socioeconomic areas. Introduction When the digital divide was first conceptualised (Gore 1998) it focused on the ‘haves' and ‘have nots' with regard to having access to computer technology or not. While access remains a contentious issue it is readily apparent that the focus eventually shifted to the quality of access to the internet via dial-up or broadband. This was because those who had access via dial-up had their actions considerably restricted by the poorer quality of the connection while those on broadband had a broader range of possibilities available to them, resulting in a new divide. Today, while access is not universal, it needs to be considered in terms of the quality of the activities that being connected to the internet via a computer, or any device, affords as well as the expectations that teachers have of their students in these new learning contexts. In contemporary times digital engagement and social inclusion are important issues of concern in globalised contexts. This chapter argues that discussions of equity and social inclusion need to consider qualitatively different types of use of new technologies. It asserts that pedagogies concerned with socially disadvantaged students need to recognise that there are qualitatively different types of activities that can be conducted with new media and support students to become fluent in all of them and not just those that fulfil the criteria for access. This means taking a new approach and creating contexts for teaching and learning that value the life experiences of students and support them to encounter, and have success with, higher levels of sophisticated activities that are respectful of their needs and interests.",https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781107300910.004,incollection

Yet despite numerous examples of this 'urban labelling' phenomenon, we know surprisingly little about so-called smart cities, particularly in terms of what the label ideologically reveals as well as hides. Due to its lack of definitional precision, not to mention an underlying self-congratulatory tendency, the main thrust of this article is to provide a preliminary critical polemic against some of the more rhetorical aspects of smart cities. The primary focus is on the labelling process adopted by some designated smart cities, with a view to problematizing a range of elements that supposedly characterize this new urban form, as well as question some of the underlying assumptions/ contradictions hidden within the concept. To aid this critique, the article explores to what extent labelled smart cities can be understood as a high-tech variation of the 'entrepreneurial city', as well as speculates on some general principles which would make them more progressive and inclusive.",https://doi.org/10.4067/S0250-71612014000100013,misc

Taking feedback from students at the end of the semester, however, has the disadvantage of not benefitting the students that have already taken the course. To benefit the current students, feedback should be given in real time and addressed in real time. This would enable students and lecturers to address teaching and learning issues in the most beneficial way for the students. Analysing students' feedback using sentiment analysis techniques can identify the students' positive or negative feelings, or even more refined emotions, that students have towards the current teaching. Feedback can be collected in a variety of ways, with previous research using student response systems such as clickers, SMS and mobile phones.

New demands of citizens (such as participation in the decision-making processes and activities, and the need for services designed for minorities and excluded social groups) produce a paradigm shift in the sense of ""Human Cities."" Smart Cities and digital inclusion efforts are moving rapidly. Multiple initiatives are taking place all around the world using different technologies to address accessibility, safety (especially for women), and social inclusion of vulnerable groups. However, these efforts remain widely dispersed. Without better collaboration between local governments, citizens, and other authorities, there is a notorious risk of leaving behind people with disabilities and the elderly. In the Smart City's context, the mobility of people plays a crucial role in mitigating the social exclusion of vulnerable groups. It ensures their access to basic services and their social and employment relationships. One of the most vulnerable groups of citizens is the elderly. They demand special requirements in the design of smart mobility. At the same time, Smart City's technologies can be used to maintain the elderly's quality of life. This leads to the concept of Interconnected Public Spaces.

Based on a systematic literature review of 289 international peer-reviewed survey-based and experimental studies, we analyze both definitions and measurements of OPP. We find a series of disconnections: Measures preponderantly address online activities, yet merely a small share of definitions focuses on the online sphere. While only few definitions account for passive activities (e.g., reading news about politics), many operationalizations include measures capturing such passive behaviors. Expressive activities are most popular in measures of OPP, but definitions rarely reflect this focus. Finally, while measures of OPP are prone to be platform-specific, definitions tend to neglect this characteristic.

There is a need for diverse data collection methods, considering demographic and financial aspects, understanding social dynamics, employing dynamic models, recognizing interconnected systems, and giving due attention to the often-neglected recovery phase. This study proposes a comprehensive DPRMT concept framework leveraging decision-makers with a holistic and efficient approach that offers real-time, detailed, and data-driven modeling solutions to achieve insights into disaster-affected areas and communities. It is also helpful to optimize response planning, resource allocation, and scenario testing by capturing the dynamic and complex human behaviors and understanding interconnected systems and entities that are often overlooked in previous disaster risk management studies.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2024.104629,misc

"Buttazzoni, Adrian and Veenhof, Marta and Minaker, Leia",2020.0,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,"Urban infrastructure systems responsible for the provision of energy, transportation, shelter, and communication to populations are important determinants of health and health equity. The term “smart city” has been used synonymously with other terms, such as “digital city”, “sustainable city”, and “information city”, even though definitional distinctions exist between terms. In this review, we use “smart cities” as a catch-all term to refer to an emerging concept in urban governance practice and scholarship that has been increasingly applied to achieve public health aims. The objective of this systematic review was to document and analyze the inclusion of equity considerations and dimensions (i.e., a measurement, analytical, or dialectical focus on systematic disparities in health between groups) in smart city interventions aimed to improve human health and well-being. Systematic searches were carried out in the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Psychological Information Database (PsycINFO), the PubMed database from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, Elsevier's database Scopus, and Web of Science, returning 3219 titles. Ultimately, 28 articles were retained, assessed, and coded for their inclusion of equity characteristics using the Cochrane PROGRESS-Plus tool (referring to (P) place of residence, (R) race, (O) occupation, (G) gender, (R) religion, (E) education, (S) socio-economic status (SES), and (S) social capital). The most frequently included equity considerations in smart city health interventions were place of residence, SES, social capital, and personal characteristics; conversely, occupation, gender or sex, religion, race, ethnicity, culture, language, and education characteristics were comparatively less featured in such interventions. Overall, it appears that most of intervention evaluations assessed in this review are still in the early testing phases, and thus did not include or feature robust evaluative designs or commercially available technologies.",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17072325,misc

"Facente, Shelley N. and Grebe, Eduard and Maher, Andrew D. and Fox, Douglas and Scheer, Susan and Mahy, Mary and Dalal, Shona and Lowrance, David and Marsh, Kimberly",2022.0,JMIR Public Health and Surveillance,"Background: HIV assays designed to detect recent infection, also known as ""recency assays,"" are often used to estimate HIV incidence in a specific country, region, or subpopulation, alone or as part of recent infection testing algorithms (RITAs). Recently, many countries and organizations have become interested in using recency assays within case surveillance systems and routine HIV testing services to measure other indicators beyond incidence, generally referred to as ""non-incidence surveillance use cases."" Objective: This review aims to identify published evidence that can be used to validate methodological approaches to recency-based incidence estimation and non-incidence use cases. The evidence identified through this review will be used in the forthcoming technical guidance by the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) on the use of HIV recency assays for identification of epidemic trends, whether for HIV incidence estimation or non-incidence indicators of recency. Methods: To identify the best methodological and field implementation practices for the use of recency assays to estimate HIV incidence and trends in recent infections for specific populations or geographic areas, we conducted a systematic review of the literature to (1) understand the use of recency testing for surveillance in programmatic and laboratory settings, (2) review methodologies for implementing recency testing for both incidence estimation and non-incidence use cases, and (3) assess the field performance characteristics of commercially available recency assays. Results: Among the 167 documents included in the final review, 91 (54.5%) focused on assay or algorithm performance or methodological descriptions, with high-quality evidence of accurate age- and sex-disaggregated HIV incidence estimation at national or regional levels in general population settings, but not at finer geographic levels for prevention prioritization. The remaining 76 (45.5%) described the field use of incidence assays including field-derived incidence (n=45), non-incidence (n=25), and both incidence and non-incidence use cases (n=6). The field use of incidence assays included integrating RITAs into routine surveillance and assisting with molecular genetic analyses, but evidence was generally weaker or only reported on what was done, without validation data or findings related to effectiveness of using non-incidence indicators calculated through the use of recency assays as a proxy for HIV incidence. Conclusions: HIV recency assays have been widely validated for estimating HIV incidence in age- and sex-specific populations at national and subnational regional levels; however, there is a lack of evidence validating the accuracy and effectiveness of using recency assays to identify epidemic trends in non-incidence surveillance use cases. More research is needed to validate the use of recency assays within HIV testing services, to ensure findings can be accurately interpreted to guide prioritization of public health programming.",https://doi.org/10.2196/34410,misc

"Weitekamp, Michael R.",2003.0,Portable Health Administration,"Historically, health care management information systems (MISs) focused primarily on finance and the transactions related to revenue cycle and supply management. Automating processes improved transaction time and accuracy, required fewer employees, and yielded a favorable ""return on investment"" (ROI). This functionality was available by ""outsourcing"" contracts, often to financial services companies or service bureaus using mainframe computers. The cost of onsite computer hardware, software, and the personnel to run them was, therefore, minimal. Eventually, as the cost of hardware dropped, as powerful minicomputers and microcomputers arrived, and as software became more ""expert,"" many of these transactional tasks were brought in house. Functionality was added incrementally to automate such processes as patient registration, scheduling, admission, transfer, and discharge. Other ""islands"" and ""best-of-breed"" automation existed in areas such as laboratory services, radiology, and critical care units, but rarely did these systems talk to each other. Powerful environmental forces continue to forge tighter linkages between the financing and delivery of health care and accountability for outcomes. Refinements of MIS to realize even greater productivity gains in business operations and drive operating margin is imperative. Central to most MIS planning is a movement away from a paper-based medical record to a ""computerized patient record"" (CPR) or ""electronic medical record"" (EMR). The potential advantages of such a record are numerous. In most modem health care facilities, organization of MIS is moving to a more centralized model, away from smaller shops dedicated to data processing, computer services, medical records, and desktop support. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-012780590-0/50047-X,incollection

In this paper we present a new protocol called Low Energy Adaptive Tier Clustering Hierarchy (LEATCH), which offers a good compromise between delay and energy consumption and resolves some coverage problems. For our purpose, a two level hierarchical approach has been proposed to organize a sensor network into a set of clusters, every cluster divided into small clusters that are called Mini Clusters. As the way the clusters are organized, for each mini cluster we define a Mini Cluster-Head (MCH). Every MCH communicates with the cluster-head directly, it aggregates its mini-cluster information. In addition, we have made some changes in the procedure of cluster head and mini cluster head election. LEATCH promises better performances than the conventional LEACH protocol which is one of the most known hierarchical routing protocols using the probabilistic model to manage the energy consumption in WSNs.

Roadside licence check surveys represent the most direct means of estimating the prevalence of unlicensed driving. The current study involved the Queensland Police Service (QPS) checking the licences of 3,112 drivers intercepted at random breath testing operations across Queensland between February and April 2010. Data was matched with official licensing records from Transport and Main Roads (TMR) via the drivers' licence number. In total, 2,914 (93.6%) records were matched, with the majority of the 198 unmatched cases representing international or interstate licence holders (n = 156), leaving 42 unknown cases. Among the drivers intercepted at the roadside, 20 (0.6%) were identified as being unlicensed at the time, while a further 11 (0.4%) were driving unaccompanied on a Learner Licence. However, the examination of TMR licensing records revealed that an additional 9 individuals (0.3%) had a current licence sanction but were not identified as unlicensed by QPS. Thus, in total 29 of the drivers were unlicensed at the time, representing 0.9% of all the drivers intercepted and 1% of those for whom their licence records could be checked. This is considerably lower than the involvement of unlicensed drivers in fatal and serious injury crashes in Queensland, which is consistent with other research confirming the increased crash risk of the group. However, the number of unmatched records suggest that it is possible the on-road survey may have under-estimated the prevalence of unlicensed driving, so further development of the survey method is recommended.",http://casr.adelaide.edu.au/rsr/RSR2011/2DPaper 155 Watson.pdf https://eprints.qut.edu.au/50487/,misc

Although clustering based routing approaches are appropriate for small-scale networks, they do not fit large scale WSNs as it is the case in LEACH [1]. Indeed, clustering suffers from the adverse effects of isolated nodes in the network and some coverage problems. To deal with these issues, we present LEATCH-L, a Low Energy Adaptive Tier Clustering Hierarchy for Large scale WSNs. The proposed approach makes the major functions of LEACH applicable to large-scale WSNs whose dimension is much larger than the largest transmission radius of the sensor nodes. The latter imposes a dynamic decomposable structure on the network topology which results in a set of smaller subnetworks. Such decompositions are implemented through a smart m-level hierarchical clustering process. Moreover, the proposed approach involves a two level data aggregation.

LEACH uses localized coordination to enable scalability and robustness for dynamic networks, and incorporates data fusion into the routing protocol to reduce the amount of information that must be transmitted to the base station. Simulations show that LEACH can achieve as much as a factor of 8 reduction in energy dissipation compared with conventional routing protocols.

"Ganesan, Sangeetha and Shanmugaraj, G. and Indumathi, A.",2023.0,Risk Detection and Cyber Security for the Success of Contemporary Computing,"With regard to intrusion detection systems (IDS), several research communities have shown interest in cyber security in recent years. IDS software keeps an eye out for malicious activity on a single computer or a network of computers. It is becoming increasingly important to detect intrusions and prevent them. Several methods to avoid or find intrusion in a network have been proposed in the past. However, the majority of the IDS detection methods currently in use are ineffective at solving this issue. Accuracy is the key factor in how well an intrusion detection system performs. In recent works, various techniques have been employed to enhance performance. In addition to this, machine learning (ML) has been used in many applications to produce results that are accurate in the relevant field. Determining how machine learning and data mining can be used to detect IDS in a network in the near future is the focus of this work. This literature review focuses on ML and data mining (DM) techniques for cyber analytics to support intrusion detection.",https://doi.org/10.4018/978-1-6684-9317-5.ch004,incollection

"Bibri, Simon Elias",2018.0,Sustainable Cities and Society,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the key components of the ICT infrastructure of smart sustainable cities as an emerging urban development approach due to its great potential to advance environmental sustainability. As one of the prevalent ICT visions or computing paradigms, the IoT is associated with big data analytics, which is clearly on a penetrative path across many urban domains for optimizing energy efficiency and mitigating environmental effects. This pertains mainly to the effective utilization of natural resources, the intelligent management of infrastructures and facilities, and the enhanced delivery of services in support of the environment. As such, the IoT and related big data applications can play a key role in catalyzing and improving the process of environmentally sustainable development. However, topical studies tend to deal largely with the IoT and related big data applications in connection with economic growth and the quality of life in the realm of smart cities, and largely ignore their role in improving environmental sustainability in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. In addition, several advanced technologies are being used in smart cities without making any contribution to environmental sustainability, and the strategies through which sustainable cities can be achieved fall short in considering advanced technologies. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to review and synthesize the relevant literature with the objective of identifying and discussing the state-of-the-art sensor-based big data applications enabled by the IoT for environmental sustainability and related data processing platforms and computing models in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. Also, this paper identifies the key challenges pertaining to the IoT and big data analytics, as well as discusses some of the associated open issues. Furthermore, it explores the opportunity of augmenting the informational landscape of smart sustainable cities with big data applications to achieve the required level of environmental sustainability. In doing so, it proposes a framework which brings together a large number of previous studies on smart cities and sustainable cities, including research directed at a more conceptual, analytical, and overarching level, as well as research on specific technologies and their novel applications. The goal of this study suits a mix of two research approaches: topical literature review and thematic analysis. In terms of originality, no study has been conducted on the IoT and related big data applications in the context of smart sustainable cities, and this paper provides a basis for urban researchers to draw on this analytical framework in future research. The proposed framework, which can be replicated, tested, and evaluated in empirical research, will add additional depth to studies in the field of smart sustainable cities. This paper serves to inform urban planners, scholars, ICT experts, and other city stakeholders about the environmental benefits that can be gained from implementing smart sustainable city initiatives and projects on the basis of the IoT and related big data applications.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-73981-6,book

"Ragnedda, Massimo",2017.0,The Third Digital Divide: A Weberian Approach to Digital Inequalities,"Drawing on the thought of Max Weber, in particular his theory of stratification, this book engages with the question of whether the digital divide simply extends traditional forms of inequality, or whether it also includes new forms of social exclusion, or perhaps manifests counter-trends that alleviate traditional inequalities whilst constituting new modalities of inequality. With attention to the manner in which social stratification in the digital age is reproduced and transformed online, the author develops an account of stratification as it exists in the digital sphere, advancing the position that, just as in the social sphere, inequalities in the online world go beyond the economic elements of inequality. As such, study of the digital divide should focus not simply on class dynamics or economic matters, but cultural aspects-such as status or prestige-and political aspects-such as group affiliations. Demonstrating the enduring relevance of Weber's distinctions with regard to social inequality, The Third Digital Divide: A Weberian approach to rethinking digital inequalities explores the ways in which online activities and digital skills vary according to crucial sociological dimensions, explaining these in concrete terms in relation to the dynamics of social class, social status and power.

"VERBA, SIDNEY and SCHLOZMAN, KAY LEHMAN and BRADY, HENRY E.",2021.0,Voice and Equality,"In this book, Verba, Schlozman and Brady investigate political participation and its processes in the United States. A healthy democracy is conditioned on participation and the processes that determine who is given voice and how much. Using an assessment approach to the representativeness of participation that is broader than voting, including contributions, volunteerism, and contacts to officials, the authors explore the barriers to and adequacy of representation. The authors present a conception of the participatory process - the Civic Volunteerism Model. They focus on the components of motivation and capacity, but also consider the issue of recruitment. People can be expected not to participate for reasons that fall in three categories: they won't (engagement), they can't (resources), or no one asked (recruitment). Since participation is voluntary, the process involves choice; that choice, however, is constrained by resources. Therefore, the model demostrated that the resources factor is the strongest determinant for participation. Resources affecting the likelihood of participation are a of collection factors - including income, education, time, and civic skills. Civic skills, interestingly, are usually obtained in nonpolitical settings such as church or an organization. Given the rise in campaign spending, the authors make careful distinctions between giving time and giving money. Verba, Schlozman and Brady stress that many social characteristics, such as poverty and education level, are often bundled with minority groups. Since education and income are causally related to participatory activities or are 'participation factors,' a disproportionately fewer number of messages are coming minority groups. Further, the homogenity of the group influences the complexity of representation; public representation may be sufficient from one perspective, but quite insufficient from another. In this way participation factors also create distortion in those elected to represent a group – representation distortion. This can manifest itself descriptively or substantively, with a representative either being unlike their constituents ethnically and culturally or showing policy preferences that do not reflect the needs of their constituency. For example, a wealthy, well-educated young African American woman is likely not the best representative for a target group of lower income, high school attainment, single mothers who also happen to be African American. Nonetheless, those with higher education or income are more likely to be recruited to take part in politics.",https://doi.org/10.2307/j.ctv1pnc1k7,book

With interdisciplinary contributors from six continents, working in diverse fields such as digital media studies, social computing, community informatics and cultural studies, the collection brings together theoretical and applied research evidence on three vulnerable population categories: ethnic minorities, older people and people with disabilities. Each section is accompanied by a critical commentary on the research insights presented, from third sector community and policy experts. The collection explores whether vulnerable populations face similar experiences and challenges in relation to their digital inclusion status, stressing the central presence of intersectionality, and arguing for the inclusion of the age, ethnicity/immigration status and disability aspects of one's identity. At the same time, it argues for multi-directional action that tackles intersectional discrimination in the digital realm on behalf of more than one single population category or group.

To ensure digital training programmes are adequately managed, a standardized data collection strategy is required to measure an internationally accepted Digital Literacy Index. This index must be defined by a dynamic definition of Digital Literacy responsive to the fluid needs of the digital economy. This requires the introduction of a G20 standard-setting body informing a nationally representative data collection strategy. Furthermore, the adopted standards which inform the data collection process must be cognizant of the evolving demands of employers. _________________________________________________________________________ Challenge Recent G20 communiques of 2015 and 2016 have made pronouncements on addressing the digital divide but have largely focused on infrastructure development, financial inclusion or digital trade. Insufficient attention has been paid to the need for digital skills t, partly due to the difficulties in defining and measuring Digital Literacy. Digital Literacy, as with general literacy, provides an individual with the capability to achieve other valued outputs in life, especially in the modern digital economy. Unlike, literacy, the definition of Digital Literacy is contested, leading to the development of different and inconsistent sets of indicators for measuring Digital Literacy.

It also engages the literature concerning the role of sense of place in community engagement and the disruption in place attachment, identity, and dependence that natural disasters can cause. By drawing on interview data collected from residents who returned to New Orleans after the storm and from former New Orleanians who evacuated to Houston but did not return, this article investigates the "" sense of place"" that residents in Ninth Ward New Orleans neighborhoods identify in their narratives about their pre- and post-Hurricane Katrina experiences. The data considered here suggest that returning residents believe that New Orleans in general (and their Ninth Ward neighborhoods in particular) possess a unique bundle of characteristics that, when taken together, cannot be found or replicated elsewhere. While sense of place is an important motivator for returning residents, the data also suggest that complementary factors must be in place if the full potential of this social resource is to be realized. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1467-9906.2009.00479.X,article

The Buiksloterham area in Amsterdam is a pioneering case study of a more flexible approach to planning in the Netherlands, commonly known as organic transformation, combining formal and informal instruments in an innovative way. The case study demonstrates the tension between the planners' desire for maximum flexibility in terms of land uses to enable mixed-use and organic development, and the legal certainty required by planning law (via the legally binding land-use plan), demanding exact predictions of future impacts to safeguard environmental norms. How can planning steer densification and enable mixed-use development, while at the same time accommodating the self-organising potential of society in an increasingly dynamic and unpredictable world? Using the concept of 'legal contextualisation', the paper argues that densification through organic approaches is possible with the current legislation but is not a panacea given the challenge of safeguarding environmental norms under conditions of uncertainty about the actual development.",https://doi.org/10.3828/TPR.2020.16,article

The Internet of Things (IoT) is made of sensors and other components that connect our version of the world made of atoms, i.e., humans/our bodies, our devices, vehicles, roads, buildings, plants, animals, etc., with a mirror digital version made of bits. This enables cities and regions to be self-aware and dynamically reconfigurable in real- or near-real-time, based on changes that are continuously monitored and captured by sensors, similar to the way the internal biological systems of a living being operate and respond to their environment (homeostasis). Data collected by various IoT sensors and processed via appropriate analytics can also help predict the immediate future with reasonable accuracy, which enables better planned responses and mitigation actions. Cities and regions can thus become more adaptable and resilient in face of adversity. Furthermore, IoT can link atoms (humans) to other atoms (humans) (again via bits), resulting in the formation of 'smart(er) communities' that are socially connected in new ways and potentially happier. Cities, but also less urbanised regions and the countryside, could all benefit from, and harness the power of, IoT to improve the health, well-being and overall quality of life of the local populations, actively engage citizens in a smarter governance of their region, empower them to better care for one another, promote stronger social inclusion, and ensure a greener, sustainable and more enjoyable environment for all. Technology can also help reverse the 'brain drain' from the countryside and smaller towns to larger metropolises by making the former more attractive and connected, with better services akin to those found in larger cities. The article also discusses some ways of measuring and benchmarking the performance of smart cities and their impact on well-being. However, it should be emphasised that technology is not a panacea and that other factors are equally important in creating happier and healthier cities and regions.",https://doi.org/10.1186/1476-072X-14-3,article
"Maye, Damian",2019.0,"{'smart food city': Conceptual relations between smart city planning, urban food systems and innovation theory","This paper develops a conceptual link between smart city planning and urban food systems research in terms of governance and innovation. The 'smart city' concept is linked to an urban research agenda which seeks to embed advances in technology and data collection into the infrastructures of urban environments. Through this neoliberal framework, market-led and technological solutions to city governance and development are prioritised. The urban food movement has a different trajectory compared to the smart city agenda, comprising a diverse mix of urban food production practices, including community and grassroots-based social innovations, and associated more recently with food security discourses. Recognising these ideological and epistemological differences (between the smart city and the urban food movement) is important for conceptualisations of 'smart food city' governance. Based on theoretical reflections, review material and findings from a European project on city-region food systems, the paper argues that smart technology can be an important part of the solution to city food challenges but in combination with social innovations to enable flexible modes of governance that are inclusive, technologically and socially-orientated and linked to specific city-region contexts. Key elements include city regionalism, new organisational structures and connectivities, a circular model of metabolism and social practices.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.CCS.2017.12.001,article

Cities, perceived as attractive places for people to live,must now meet many conditions. A city's duty is, among others, to meet the needs and expectations of both, its residents and newcomers, offering a wide range of opportunities for entrepreneurs, caring for the natural environment, constantly taking on new challenges, and meeting them for its further development. Thus, the management of a city involves undertaking activities in line with the smart city idea. However, to implement them, they use widely available means, defined as intelligent solutions, e.g., modern ICT technologies. In line with the smart city idea, a city is a center inhabited by people who create a civic and participatory society, having the ability to use the latest ICT solutions and having access to a range of services and solutions offered by the city. Since the smart city idea is considered at many levels, it is still unknown what dimensions or areas related to this concept are the most valuable and stimulating for its implementation. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to study what dimensions or areas related to this idea are the most valuable and stimulating for its implementation. The applied methodology is based on a critical analysis of the available literature in the form of bibliometric and citation analysis and analysis of the keyword characteristics of S.C. co-occurrences.

Design/methodology/approach: A rich in-depth case study has been carried out exploring the experience of a smart city in the north of Italy. The study explores the institutional works done by multiple actors (Lawrence et al., 2013) and their influence on the governance of the smart city.

Specifically, the number of other consumers with debit cards increases by 21 percent. Richer consumers respond to corner stores' adoption of POS terminals by substituting 13 percent of their supermarket consumption to corner stores.

"Lee, Jungwoo",2010.0,{10year retrospect on stage models of e-Government: A qualitative meta-synthesis,"Growing interests in e-Government raise the question about the developmental stages of e-Government. Since the year 2000, a number of e-Government stage models have been suggested by international organizations, consulting firms, and individual researchers. However, these models seem to be incongruent with each other as these are based on different perspectives and use somewhat different metaphors. This presents a difficulty not only in understanding different research results, but also in planning future actions for e-Government. Without a common frame of reference for understanding the developmental stages and perspectives reflected in different models and stages, e-Government research may become fragmented and disconnected from each other. In this research, we have conducted a qualitative meta-synthesis of twelve e-Government stage models. Concepts, metaphors, and themes contained in these developmental models are extracted through a series of in-depth semantic analyses of descriptions and explanations. The first order concepts and themes are subjected to an interpretive synthesis identifying reciprocal relationships which in turn leads to the identification of implied metaphors and themes. Five metaphors are identified: presenting, assimilating, reforming, morphing and e-governance, while two underlying themes surface: citizen/service and operation/technology. These concepts, metaphors, and themes are synthesized into a common frame of reference using a reciprocal translation technique. A supportive line of argument is developed for this frame of reference so that different e-Government stage models can be translated into each other. This study contributes to current research through offering theoretical advances related to the stages of e-Government. Furthermore, the metaphors and themes identified in this study would be useful as a conceptual frame for researchers to evaluate and understand the development of e-Government, and as a base road map for practitioners in planning future e-Government projects. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.giq.2009.12.009,article

Automating processes improved transaction time and accuracy, required fewer employees, and yielded a favorable ""return on investment"" (ROI). This functionality was available by ""outsourcing"" contracts, often to financial services companies or service bureaus using mainframe computers. The cost of onsite computer hardware, software, and the personnel to run them was, therefore, minimal. Eventually, as the cost of hardware dropped, as powerful minicomputers and microcomputers arrived, and as software became more ""expert,"" many of these transactional tasks were brought in house. Functionality was added incrementally to automate such processes as patient registration, scheduling, admission, transfer, and discharge. Other ""islands"" and ""best-of-breed"" automation existed in areas such as laboratory services, radiology, and critical care units, but rarely did these systems talk to each other. Powerful environmental forces continue to forge tighter linkages between the financing and delivery of health care and accountability for outcomes. Refinements of MIS to realize even greater productivity gains in business operations and drive operating margin is imperative. Central to most MIS planning is a movement away from a paper-based medical record to a ""computerized patient record"" (CPR) or ""electronic medical record"" (EMR). The potential advantages of such a record are numerous. In most modem health care facilities, organization of MIS is moving to a more centralized model, away from smaller shops dedicated to data processing, computer services, medical records, and desktop support. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1086/603200,misc

Our goal is to exploit available technologies such as Wireless Sensor Network (WSNs) and Vehicular Ad hoc NETworks (VANETs) to forward alerts from victims to rescue services. We propose an opportunistic data dissemination protocol (3DMAT) for disaster management in which both WSNs and VANETs participate in decision-making for the dissemination process so that messages are delivered in a timely manner. The simulation results show that the proposed protocol performs data dissemination more efficiently than other protocols. 3DMAT calculates the quality of nodes and the link between them to select the most relevant relay. Our protocol is 47% faster and generates a 17% lower communication load and 14% fewer redundant messages. These improvements are due to a selection strategy that targets the most relevant nodes to relay information.",https://doi.org/10.1007/S12243-021-00847-X,article

In this paper, a collaborative code dissemination (CCD) approach with two-way vehicle to everything (V2X) paradigm is proposed by using vehicles act as code mules to disseminate code with fast and low cost style for urban Computing. The main innovation of the CCD-V2X scheme, which is different from the previous code dissemination method, is the use of three cooperative communication methods to speed up the dissemination of code. They are Roadside Smart Devices (RSDs) to vehicle (R2V), vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and R2V combined V2V (R2V-V2V) communications method. The corresponding three code dissemination schemes are proposed as follow: (1) The Code Dissemination with Roadside Smart Device Assisted (short as CDRSDA) scheme is proposed for vehicles to fast disseminate code in which the vehicles can receive code from RSDs that have get update code. (2) A Code Dissemination with V2V Transmission Assisted (short as CDVVA) scheme is proposed to improve the performance of code dissemination by enabling the transmission from code mules that have update code to the code mules that have no update code. (3) The R2V combined V2V (R2V-V2V) scheme is proposed which can further improve the performance by using both R2V and V2V communication method. The CCD scheme has been extensively experimentally verified by using real vehicle trajectory data. The experimental results show that: Compared with the Traditional Scheme, the CDRSDA scheme, CDVVA scheme, R2V-V2V scheme can be increased by up to 35.42%, 35.42%, 34.72%, respectively from the code diffusion coverage performance index, and from the speed performance indicators, the three schemes increased by at least 68.4%, 89.3% and 90.3%.",https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2940639,article

From network agents co-creating knowledge for the digital economy as a foundational point of departure, we problematize the management of this co-created knowledge. As network power shifts, so does the foundational capabilities and contexts. As demonstrated by the increased use of multiple stakeholder groups to co-create innovative solutions. These stakeholder groups are commonly classified as Triple helix, Quadruple helix, n Tuple helix. The problems caused by shifts in network power and agent capabilities become apparent in co-creative systems design processes such as Living Labs and popular Design Science frameworks. As the disruptive power of digital change creates shifts in the foundational design network's agency, knowledge is lost. We postulate that it is typically highly technical design knowledge - created at a high cost during co-creation - that is lost first. We present examples of technical design knowledge flowing out of the network from a local Smart Community design case. Towards the prevention of co-created design knowledge loss as a result of changes in the foundational network, we suggest the use of physical ideation artefacts for the storage, management, and continued dissemination of the knowledge within the network. We present a case study where local, co-created, technical, Smart Community design knowledge was stored explicitly as ideation artefacts called 'tech cards' and retained over time within the network after highly disruptive shifts in the capability set of the foundational agent network responsible for the original knowledge creation. The co-creation of physical, knowledge-rich ideation artefacts as part of system design processes such as Living Labs shows promise as a Knowledge Management tool (KMT) amidst fast paced digital change in the knowledge economy.",https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIM49319.2020.245373,article

Evacuation systems are of great importance to ensure life safety. Due to panic, people in a building may not be able to make the right judgment to choose an optimal path to leave the building in case of an emergency event such as a fire. As a branch of machine learning, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) can model an evacuation scene, collect real-time information, such as crowd distribution and disaster location, find the optimal escape path with a path-planning algorithm, induce the movement state of the crowd through dynamic guidance signs, and improve the evacuation efficiency. In this article, we apply DRL technology to solve the efficient emergency evacuation problem with the help of metaverse and show a training system built upon metaverse that would enable evacuees to choose the most efficient route and leave the building in the least amount of time. The information collected by various sensors, such as video cameras and smoke detectors, can give a whole picture of the status of the building in a real-time manner. The collected data are processed by cloud servers in which a DRL model is trained to dynamically guide evacuees.

In addition to being an important research issue in user acceptance research, understanding antecedents of perceived ease of use is also important from a practical standpoint since several systems in which millions of dollars are invested are rejected because of poor user interfaces.

The review involved the qualitative analysis of 44 research papers reporting on smart city innovation practices and outcomes. The results characterize five major challenge categories for smart city innovation: Strategic vision; Organizational Capabilities and Agility; Technology Domestication; Ecosystem Development; and Transboundary Innovation. This study also explores the connections between these challenges and concrete digital innovation practices in smart city initiatives. The main conclusion is that current innovation practices in smart cities are not properly aligned with what the research literature commonly describes as core properties of digital innovation and that this might be a major cause behind the limited progress in smart city initiatives.",https://doi.org/10.3390/SMARTCITIES7010006,article

"Cumbie, Barry A. and Kar, Bandana",2016.0,{A Study of Local Government Website Inclusiveness: The Gap Between E-government Concept and Practice,"This study examines the concept of electronic government (e-government) inclusiveness and evaluates the inclusiveness of local e-government websites. Inclusiveness sets e-government apart from other types of websites (e.g. commercial or organizational sites) that only serve exclusive market segments. An evaluation for inclusiveness of 101 local government websites from Mississippi (an underdeveloped area by many health and social metrics) revealed (1) a high frequency of issues that prevent inclusive service (on average each site had 291.83 issues), (2) high variability in terms of number of issues (range = [2, 3171]), and (3) widespread absence of websites (87 of the 188 municipalities and county seats did not have discoverable websites). These results suggest there is a need for more inclusiveness, but the allocation of resources to accomplish this may not be feasible. To address this, two strategic options are presented to information technology (IT) policy-makers who seek to leverage e-government for development: an idealistic approach with traditional IT investment for future returns and a pragmatic one that resembles an entrepreneurial IT start-up venture. The study contributes in three ways: we identify the concept and criteria of e-government inclusiveness; develop an automated, software-based, and replicable evaluation method that can be used by local governments to improve a website's inclusiveness; and present strategic options for using e-government to promote social and economic development.",https://doi.org/10.1080/02681102.2014.906379,article
"Hwangbo, Hwan and Yoon, Sol Hee and Jin, Beom Suk and Han, Young Suk and Ji, Yong Gu",2013.0,{A Study of Pointing Performance of Elderly Users on Smartphones,"The number of global smartphone users is rapidly increasing. However, the proportion of elderly persons using smartphones is lower than that of other age groups because they feel it is difficult to use touch screens. There have only been a few studies about usability and elderly smartphone users or designs for them. Based on this background, we studied the pointing action of elderly users, which is a basic skill required to use touch screens on smartphones. We reviewed previous works to determine specific research methods and categorized them into three groups: (a) effect of target size and spacing on touch screen pointing performance, (b) effect of age on pointing performance, and (c) feedback of touch screens. To investigate the touch screen pointing performance of elderly, we conducted two experiments. In the first experiment, 3 target sizes (5 mm, 8 mm, and 12 mm) and 2 target spacings (1 mm, 3 mm) were evaluated. Adding to that, we analyzed whether touch screen pointing performance is dependent on the location of the target. In the second experiment, 3 types of feedback (auditory, tactile, and audiotactile) were evaluated. The results show that (a) pointing performance of elderly was significantly influenced by size, spacing, and location of target, and (b) the performance was higher in audiotactile feedback condition. We expected that these results can contribute to the design of smartphone applications for elderly users. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1080/10447318.2012.729996,article

Based on the success model of the information system (IS access model), we set independent variables which were divided into quality factors (service quality, system quality, information quality) and risk factors (personal information and security), and perceived ease of use and reliability, which are the main variables based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) that best describes the parameter group, were established as useful parameters. In addition, we design the research model by setting user satisfaction and the continuous use intention as dependent variables, conducted the study about how affecting factors influence to the acceptance factors through 14 hypotheses.The study found that 12 from 14 hypotheses were adopted and 2 were rejected. Looking at the results derived, it was analyzed that, firstly, 3 quality factors all affect perceived ease of use in relation to the quality of service, system quality, information quality which are perceived ease of use of E-Government Services. Second, in relation to the quality of service quality, system quality, information quality and perceived usefulness which are the quality factors of E-Government Services, the quality of service and information quality affect perceived usefulness, but system quality does not affect perceived usefulness. Third, it was analyzed that both factors influence reliability in the relationship between Privacy and security and trust which are risk factors. Fourth, the relationship between perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness has shown that perceived ease of use does not affect perceived usefulness. Finally, the relationship between user value factors (perceptual usability, perceived usefulness and trust) and user satisfaction and the continuous use intention was analyzed that user value factors affect user satisfaction while user satisfaction affects the continuous use intention. This study can be meaningful in that it theoretically presented the factors influencing the continued acceptance of e-government services through precedent research, presented the variables and measurement items verified through the empirical analysis process, and verified the causal relationship between the variables. The e-government service can contribute to the implementation of e-government in line with the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution by using it as a reference to the establishment of policies to improve the quality of people's lives and provide convenient services to the people.",https://doi.org/10.1109/SNPD.2019.8935693,article

Research on smart cities aims to address these issues with various technologies developed for the Internet of Things. Very recently, the research focus has shifted toward processing of massive amount of data continuously generated within a city environment, e.g., physical and participatory sensing data on traffic flow, air quality, and health care. Techniques from computational intelligence have been applied to process and analyze such data, and to extract useful knowledge that helps citizens better understand their surroundings and informs city authorities to provide better and more efficient public services. Deep learning, as a relatively new paradigm in computational intelligence, has attracted substantial attention of the research community and demonstrated greater potential over traditional techniques. This paper provides a survey of the latest research on the convergence of deep learning and smart city from two perspectives: while the technique-oriented review pays attention to the popular and extended deep learning models, the application-oriented review emphasises the representative application domains in smart cities. Our study showed that there are still many challenges ahead for this emerging area owing to the complex nature of deep learning and wide coverage of smart city applications. We pointed out a number of future directions related to deep learning efficiency, emergent deep learning paradigms, knowledge fusion and privacy preservation, and hope these would move the relevant research one step further in creating truly distributed intelligence for smart cities.",https://doi.org/10.1109/TETCI.2019.2907718,article

COVID-19 boosted the development of TAM as multiple studies were rapidly undertaken during the pandemic. This, however, created a gap in our current understanding of the directions and trends of TAM advancement. The purpose of this study is to obtain insight into the advancement of TAM throughout the pandemic. It would assist researchers in comprehending the advancement and direction of TAM studies in higher education, such as gaining an understanding of the prevalent external variables for TAM, the statistical analysis employed, research methodologies, the technologies studied, and the geographic location of the research conducted. Finally, research gaps and future directions for TAM studies are presented. A systematic review utilizing PRISMA was conducted on 104 sampled publications. It was found that self-efficacy, subjective norms, experience, and enjoyment were the external variables most frequently used in TAM, while internal motivation received minimal attention. The existing studies have focused mainly on student samples, so further investigation is needed into lecturers, higher education personnel, and mixed groups. Further study is also required on qualitative and mixed methods, with the partial least square structural equation model currently dominating statistical analysis. Future technologies such as 5G, AI, cloud computing, augmented reality, virtual reality, and BYOD represent new TAM-related research gaps. The majority of studies have been undertaken in Asian countries, such as China and those in southeast Asia. This new systematic literature review provides insight into the trend of TAM advancement in the sustainability of higher education during the pandemic, the identified research gaps, and recommendations for future research directions.

In this paper, a thermo-economic model is developed for the computation of a suitable metric that can aid in choosing the most cost-effective collector to use in a solar water heating system and to determine the optimal sizing of the solar water heater components once the choice collector has been picked. The energy-per-dollar comparison metric, calculated as the annual heat energy output of the collector in an average year, at the so-called “sweet-spot” size of the collector array, divided by the annualized life-cycle cost, based on warranty life and collector initial cost, was recommended as instructive for comparing cost-effectiveness of different solar collectors. For the determination of the sweet-spot size of collector to use in a particular solar water heating system, at which the energy-per-dollar is calculated, the Net Present Value of Solar Savings was used as the objective function to maximize. Ten (10) different models of liquid solar thermal collectors (5 flat plate and 5 evacuated tube type), which are rated by the Solar Ratings & Certification Corporation (SRCC), were ranked according to the energy-per-dollar criterion through the thermo-economic model described in this study. At the sweet-spot collector area for the solar water heating system, the corresponding volume of hot water storage tank and the optimal solar fraction are also simultaneously determined. The required hot water storage volume decreases as the deployed collector area increases while the solar fraction increases, with diminishing marginal increase, until it saturates at a value of unity. For the present case study where the required load temperature is 50 °C and the solar water heating system is located in central Zimbabwe (latitude 19° S and longitude 30° E), the selected collector model happened to be a flat-plate type, which achieved the highest energy-per-dollar score of 26.1 kWh/$. The optimal size of this collector model to deploy in the solar water heating system at the case-study location is 18 m2 per m3 of daily hot water demand; with a hot water storage volume of 900 l/m3; at an optimal solar fraction of 91%. Although the method of this paper was applied only for a solar water heating application of specified operating temperature, at a specified location, it can be applied equally well for any other solar water heating application and at any other location.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-93438-9_1,incollection

Wearable devices are integrated with some daily necessities and they gather information, such as motion data and physiological data. In general, the Kalman-based filters are used to remove the noise from the interference of these data to increase their accuracy. On the other hand, the data could also change dramatically in cases of sudden change, such as the wearer beginning to run without any warning, heart rate rises quickly when the wearer is startled, etc. The existing Kalman-based filters hardly distinguishes both noise and sudden changes. To address this problem, an unscented Kalman filter (UKF)-based emergency-aware fusion model is proposed in this paper to efficiently increase the accuracy of the collecting data when an emergency happens. Here, an early warning mechanism (EWM) is produced to discover the emergency. The traditional UKF is used when an emergency does not exist. The gain matrix should be compensated to reduce the filtering error when an emergency exists. Therefore, the estimator should be adjusted accordingly to avoid it. In simulations, important parameters are discussed.

{Van Deth,2014.0,{A conceptual map of political participation,"How would you recognize a mode of participation if you see one? Owing to the rapid expansion of political activities in the last decades this question has become increasingly difficult to answer. Neither the development of all-embracing nominal definitions, nor deductive analyses of existing modes of participation seem to be helpful. In addition, the spread of expressive modes of participation makes it hard to avoid purely subjective definitions. The aim of this discussion paper is to develop an operational definition of political participation, which allows us to cover distinct conceptualizations systematically, efficiently and consistently. This goal can only be arrived at if the conventional approach of presenting nominal definitions to solve conceptual problems is left behind. Instead, available definitions are included in a set of decision rules to distinguish three main variants of political participation. A fourth variant is distinguished for non-political activities used for political purposes. Together, the four variants of political participation cover the whole range of political participation systematically without excluding any mode of political participation unknown yet. At the same time, the endless expansion of the modes of political participation in modern democracies does not result in an endless conceptual expansion.

{Al Ridhawi,2018.0,{A continuous diversified vehicular cloud service availability framework for smart cities,"The intelligent and connected transportation system (ICTS) is a significant and mandatory component of the smart city architecture. Multimedia content sharing, vehicle power management, and road navigation are all examples of ICTS services. As smart cities continue to deploy different technologies to improve the performance and diversity of vehicular cloud services, one of the main issues that prevails is efficient and reliable service discovery and selection for smart vehicles. Furthermore, cloud service providers (SPs) are limited to the availability, variety and quality of services made available to vehicular cloud subscribers. Smart vehicles rely on a number of SPs to acquire the required services while moving. It therefore becomes challenging for vehicular cloud subscribers to acquire services that meet their quality of experience (QoE) preferences. This paper introduces a new service provision scheme to provide continuous availability of diversified cloud services targeting vehicular cloud users through a cluster-based trusted third party (TTP) framework. TTPs act as cloud service mediators between cloud service subscribers and providers. Vehicles that are considered to have similar patterns of movement and service acquisition characteristics are grouped into service-specific clusters. TTPs communicate with service providers and cluster heads to negotiate for services with high QoE characteristics. A location prediction method is adopted to determine a vehicle's future location and allow services to be negotiated for before the vehicle's arrival.

Using the 3RC framework, this paper critically analyses smart cities using experiences from Nairobi (Kenya), Johannesburg (South Africa), Lagos (Nigeria), Kigali (Rwanda) and Casablanca (Morocco). Are smart cities a panacea to Africa's quest for sustainable urbanization? Our analyses demonstrate that, if carefully planned and implemented, smart city interventions have the potential to transform the ways African cities are planned, managed, and governed. At the same time, smart city interventions in Africa are being implemented in contexts characterized by socio-economic inequalities, chaotic transport systems and massive governance failures among other challenges. We demonstrate that if ineffectively deployed, smart urban technologies might deepen existing inequalities and amplify spatial exclusion through privatization and marketization of urban space. Therefore, the adoption of smart city ideas in Africa must be rooted in contextual realities and properly calibrated to create urban spaces that are sustainable and inclusive.",https://doi.org/10.1080/13563475.2022.2137112,article

At the same time, various efforts have been made to evaluate performance and outcomes of those projects and initiatives. This study provides a critical analysis of 34 selected smart city assessment tools to highlight their strengths and weaknesses and to examine their potential contribution to the evolution of the smart city movement. The selected tools are evaluated against an analysis framework that covers criteria related to comprehensiveness, stakeholder engagement, context sensitivity, strategic alignment, uncertainty management, interlinkages and interoperability, temporal dynamism, flexibility, feasibility, presentation and communication of the results, and action plans. Results indicate that selected tools have achieved limited success in addressing these criteria. In particular, only few tools have addressed criteria related to stakeholder engagement, uncertainty management, interlinkages, and feasibility. The paper argues that assessment tools should capitalize on the advancements in smart solutions and big data analytics to develop better strategies for addressing these criteria. In addition to highlighting weaknesses that need to be addressed in the future, results of this study can be used by interested target groups such as smart city developers, planners, and policy makers to choose tools that best fit their needs.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.JCLEPRO.2019.06.172,article

Although a relatively small number of studies explored Arab e-government development, they did so in a single country context. This article provides an insight into the current state of Arab e-government developments. A cross-country comparative analysis of e-government Web sites and portals was conducted on 16 Arab countries to assess their development stages in e-government service delivery capability. Further comparative analysis was performed between the top Arab e-governments and the global top e-governments in developed countries with regard to ""e-democracy,"" often the highest level e-government service delivery capability identified in the literature. The results confirm a wide digital divide that remains between the Arab countries and the leading developed countries. Importantly, however, the results also show a wide digital divide even among the Arab countries studied, particularly in the development of advanced e-government service delivery capabilities. These results have important implications for developing countries in managing both economic and non-economic resources effectively for successful e-government development. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1002/ITDJ.20124,article

Moreover, scholarly research in the field of smart sustainable cities operates out of the understanding that advances in the underlying knowledge necessitate pursuing multifaceted questions that can only be resolved from the vantage point of interdisciplinarity or transdisciplinarity. Indeed, research problems in this field are inherently too complex to be addressed by single disciplines. The PhD study addressing the topic of smart sustainable city development falls within the broad research field of sustainability transition and sustainability science where ICT is seen as a salient factor given its transformational, disruptive, and synergetic effects as an enabling, integrative, and constitutive technology. In light of this, the approach to the PhD study is of an applied theoretical kind, and its aim is to investigate and analyze how to advance and sustain the contribution of sustainable urban forms to the goals of sustainable development with support of ICT of pervasive computing. This is to primarily create a framework for strategic smart sustainable city development based on scientific principles, theories, and academic disciplines and discourses used to guide urban actors in their practice towards sustainability and analyze its impact. This involves the application of a set of integrative foundational elements drawn from urban planning, urban design, sustainability, sustainable development, sustainability science, data science, computer science, complexity science, systems theory, systems thinking, and ICT. Accordingly, it is deemed of high significance to devise a multidimensional framework consisting of relevant theories and academic disciplines and discourses that underpin the development of smart sustainable cities as a set of future practices. This framework in turn emphasizes the interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary nature and orientation of the topic of smart sustainable cities and thus the relevance of pursuing an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approach into studying this topic. Therefore, this paper endeavors to systematize the very complex and dense scientific area of smart sustainable cities in terms of identifying, distilling, and structuring the core dimensions of a foundational framework for smart sustainable city development as a set of future practices. In doing so, it focuses on a number of fundamental theories along with academic disciplines and discourses, with the aim of setting a framework that analytically relates city development, sustainability, and ICT, while emphasizing how and to what extent sustainability and ICT have particularly become influential in city development in modern society. In addition, this paper offers an in–depth interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary discussion covering topics of high relevance to the PhD study and at the heart of the very synergic relationship between the theoretical, disciplinary, and discursive dimensions of the foundational framework underpinning smart sustainable city development. These dimensions thus form the basis for the framework for strategic smart sustainable city development that is under investigation and will be developed based on a backcasting approach to strategic planning. This study provides an important lens through which to understand a set of influential theories and established academic disciplines and discourses with high potential for integration, fusion, and practicality in relation to the practice of smart sustainable city development.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.SCS.2017.12.032,article

Forging long-term relationships with customers is the key to stability in an increasingly dynamic market. Despite the steady growth in the number of worldwide installations, industry studies indicate that approximately 60% of web-based CRM software (e-CRM) installations are failures. System use is recognized as one of the important indicators for successful implementation of information systems (IS) and is often correlated with other constructs, such as user attitude and behavioral intention, in the literature. The technology acceptance model (TAM) is particularly useful for explaining and analyzing IS-usage behavior and subsequently, the behavior is influenced by attitude and behavioral intention. However, TAM is incomplete for either considering only part of the attributes of the innovation factor or only part of the factors affecting IS innovation process. Therefore, this study integrates TAM with an extension of innovation diffusion theory (IDT), IS innovation model, in a complimentary manner and, furthermore, empirically concludes some guidelines for practitioners to effectively assist in the diffusion of e-CRM in organizations. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1080/0144929042000320027,article

Challenges in theorizing and practicing social sustainability: introduction to the special issue,"Since publication of the Brundtland Report in 1987, the notion of sustainable development has come to guide the pursuit of environmental reform by both public and private organizations and to facilitate communication among actors from different societal spheres. It is customary to characterize sustainable development in a familiar typology comprising three pillars: environmental, economic, and social. The relationships among these dimensions are generally assumed to be compatible and mutually supportive. However, previous research has found that when policy makers endorse sustainable development, the social dimension garners less attention and is particularly difficult to realize and operationalize. Recent years though have seen notable efforts among standard setters, planners, and practitioners in various sectors to address the often neglected social aspects of sustainability. Likewise, during the past decade, there have been efforts to develop theoretical frameworks to define and study social sustainability and to empirically investigate it in relation to “sustainability projects,” “sustainability practice,” and “sustainability initiatives.” This introductory article presents the topic and explains some of the challenges of incorporating social sustainability into a broad framework of sustainable development. Also considered is the potential of the social sustainability concept for sustainability projects and planning.

Existing growth models often use instruments that are generic, have no measures and do not relate the stages to the actual realisation of the systems architecture. Furthermore, these approaches take a one size fits all approach instead of a customized approach. Although the type of information to be measured can vary among different organizations, these approaches use similar instruments (e.g. stage models) and indicators (e.g. stages). Therefore, in this paper we propose a multi-level framework in which measures can be selected based on the domain and case specific needs and characteristics. Specifically, our framework focuses on measuring enterprise architecture, by looking at the blueprint for ICT infrastructure, information systems, organizational as well as technical aspects, horizontal and vertical integration and interoperability, and rules, regulations, laws, and legislations etc. Enterprise architecture provides basic understanding about the different elements of a public organization in a systematic manner. Therefore, this paper subsequently investigates the use of enterprise architecture and stages-of-growth models for measuring public organizations by means of an explorative case study of Dutch tax department using a multi-level architectural framework. The case study shows that the organizational information that can be retrieved from enterprise architecture is useful to measure and benchmark public organizations, which is hardly possible using state-of-growth models. The proposed multi-level framework is capable of measuring and benchmarking the information at the different levels by allowing public organizations to use multiple assessment approaches (e.g. stage models) and connecting them to enterprise architecture.

"van Deursen, Alexander J.A.M. and Helsper, Ellen J.",2015.0,{A nuanced understanding of Internet use and non-use among the elderly,"This article examines explanations for both Internet use and non-use by older individuals. Older adults are often considered a homogeneous group with uniform reasons for Internet non-use, or when they are online, practising a uniform range of activities. The study gathered data concerning senior non-users through a national telephone survey. Data concerning senior Internet users were obtained through a nationally representative online survey. The findings suggest that although a substantial part of the senior Internet non-users live in surroundings that enable Internet uptake, they seem to be less eager or unable to do so. Important differences among senior non-users are based on gender, age, education, household composition and attitude towards the Internet. Differences among users were based on life stage, social environment and psychological characteristics. This article thus reveals that older citizens are a very diverse group in which some are more likely to be digitally excluded than others.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0267323115578059,article
"Cao, Liu",2022.0,"{A post-revanchist city: A governmentality perspective on public participation in Nanjing, China","Even though a new urban policy (public participation) that seeks to avoid the criticisms of radical urban regeneration has now been widely applied in Nanjing, China, the alleged success of this urban policy is questionable. While recent research has given greater attention to growing discussions of participatory approaches of Chinese urban regeneration projects, a majority of existing literature has only examined the nature or limitations of public participation, there has been far less consideration of the government's motivation in delivering these inclusive policies. This paper interprets Nanjing's inclusive urban policies through the conceptual lens of governmentality by analyzing the revanchist residual of Chinese urban regeneration. This research combines narratives from in-depth interviews (with a particular focus on key policymakers) and supplementary data from policies and archival records. It demonstrates that the implementation of inclusive urban policies in Nanjing is a remedy to the past “revanchist” urban regeneration policies. Indeed, public participation is a method refers to the restoration of residents' rights, seeking to direct them to behave towards what the government wants them to be. To that end, I conclude that if the spirit of revanchism still exists, it is through the inclusive urban policies to conduct local residents' conducts.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.CITIES.2021.103550,article

Therefore, a mixed-methods approach was used based on a perception survey, case studies, and discussions with stakeholders and experts, to examine the current governance challenges in transforming existing cities into smart cities, and to explore various perspectives to propose a framework for an appropriate governance system for developing smart cities in India. The findings suggested that the current executive-led governance system, with special-purpose vehicles (SPVs) under the control of the state governments as the promoters of smart city development, might not lead to the smart governance system envisaged but, rather, add confusion and conflict, and undermine the constitutionally mandated, legislative-led urban local bodies.

However, to properly work with high-dimensional data sets, PCA poses severe mathematical constraints on the minimum number of different replicates, or samples, that must be included in the analysis. Generally, improper sampling is due to a small number of data respect to the number of the degrees of freedom that characterize the ensemble. In the field of life sciences it is often important to have an algorithm that can accept poorly dimensioned data sets, including degenerated ones.

The objectives of this Spanish government-funded research and development project are to investigate, develop, and evaluate innovative solutions to detect changes in psychomotor development through the natural interaction of children with toys and everyday objects, and perform stimulation and early attention activities in real environments such as home and school. Thirty multidisciplinary professionals and three nursery schools worked in the EDUCERE project between 2014 and 2017 and they obtained satisfactory results. Related to EDUCERE, we found studies based on providing networks of connected smart objects and the interaction between toys and social networks. Objective: This research includes the design, implementation, and validation of an EDUCERE smart toy aimed to automatically detect delays in psychomotor development. The results from initial tests led to enhancing the effectiveness of the original design and deployment. The smart toy, based on stackable cubes, has a data collector module and a smart system for detection of developmental delays, called the EDUCERE developmental delay screening system (DDSS). Methods: The pilot study involved 65 toddlers aged between 23 and 37 months (mean=29.02, SD 3.81) who built a tower with five stackable cubes, designed by following the EDUCERE smart toy model. As toddlers made the tower, sensors in the cubes sent data to a collector module through a wireless connection. All trials were video-recorded for further analysis by child development experts. After watching the videos, experts scored the performance of the trials to compare and fine-Tune the interpretation of the data automatically gathered by the toy-embedded sensors. Results: Judges were highly reliable in an interrater agreement analysis (intraclass correlation 0.961, 95% CI 0.937-0.967), suggesting that the process was successful to separate different levels of performance. A factor analysis of collected data showed that three factors, trembling, speed, and accuracy, accounted for 76.79% of the total variance, but only two of them were predictors of performance in a regression analysis: Accuracy (P=.001) and speed (P=.002). The other factor, trembling (P=.79), did not have a significant effect on this dependent variable. Conclusions: The EDUCERE DDSS is ready to use the regression equation obtained for the dependent variable ""performance"" as an algorithm for the automatic detection of psychomotor developmental delays. The results of the factor analysis are valuable to simplify the design of the smart toy by taking into account only the significant variables in the collector module. The fine-Tuning of the toy process module will be carried out by following the specifications resulting from the analysis of the data to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the product.",https://doi.org/10.2196/JMIR.7533,article

Collaborative services serve as a cornerstone for any smart city, fostering seamless cooperation among diverse entities, including government agencies, businesses, and individuals, thereby enhancing community outcomes. These services are pivotal, promoting seamless communication and collaboration among various smart applications, and facilitating data exchange, resource sharing, and functional interactions within smart city environments to optimize efficiency, effectiveness, and user experiences. However, the development and deployment of secure, interoperable services in smart cities present significant challenges. These issues encompass, ensuring data security compliance during interoperation, effective management of interconnected services, securely handling sensitive data across services, and addressing issues related to confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) traits. To tackle these challenges, this research proposes an innovative adaptive security governance framework tailored for smart cities. This framework relies on dynamic security policies implemented through smart contracts to guarantee data security and privacy during smart service interoperation. Real-world use cases in collaborative smart city environments validate the framework, integrating multi-chain blockchain technology, smart services APIs, and Software-Defined Networking (SDN), showcasing its ability to enhance security and efficiency in collaborative services. This study contributes to the development of safe and efficient collaborative services inside smart cities, tackling administrative issues while emphasizing data security and privacy.

Messages posted on Twitter (tweets) have been reporting everything from daily life stories to the latest local and global news and events. Monitoring and analyzing this rich and continuous user-generated content can yield unprecedentedly valuable information, enabling users and organizations to acquire actionable knowledge. This article provides a survey of techniques for event detection from Twitter streams. These techniques aim at finding real-world occurrences that unfold over space and time. In contrast to conventional media, event detection from Twitter streams poses new challenges. Twitter streams contain large amounts of meaningless messages and polluted content, which negatively affect the detection performance. In addition, traditional text mining techniques are not suitable, because of the short length of tweets, the large number of spelling and grammatical errors, and the frequent use of informal and mixed language. Event detection techniques presented in literature address these issues by adapting techniques from various fields to the uniqueness of Twitter.

In this paper, we take stock of the large body of extant research and provide a systematic assessment of empirical evidence. In all, 308 statistical tests from 63 articles, selected according to a set of clear criteria, were examined across various dimensions. We assess not only the level of empirical support for the theory, but also the degree of paradigm consensus present in the empirical literature. Our analysis shows that results are mixed: while we found support in some areas (e.g., with regard to asset specificity), we also found considerable disagreement on how to operationalize some of TCE's central constructs and propositions, and relatively low levels of empirical support in other core areas (e.g., surrounding uncertainty and performance). We conclude that a more thorough empirical grounding of the theory's foundation is crucial to its future development, and offer several strategies for doing this.

This study explores the extent to which teleworking reduces the need to travel to work and the consequent impacts on economy-wide energy consumption. The paper provides a systematic review of the current state of knowledge of the energy impacts of teleworking. This includes the energy savings from reduced commuter travel and the indirect impacts on energy consumption associated with changes in non-work travel and home energy consumption. The aim is to identify the conditions under which teleworking leads to a net reduction in economy-wide energy consumption, and the circumstances where benefits may be outweighed by unintended impacts. The paper synthesises the results of 39 empirical studies, identified through a comprehensive search of 9000 published articles. Twenty six of the 39 studies suggest that teleworking reduces energy use, and only eight studies suggest that teleworking increases, or has a neutral impact on energy use. However, differences in the methodology, scope and assumptions of the different studies make it difficult to estimate 'average' energy savings. The main source of savings is the reduced distance travelled for commuting, potentially with an additional contribution from lower office energy consumption. However, the more rigorous studies that include a wider range of impacts (e.g. non-work travel or home energy use) generally find smaller savings. Despite the generally positive verdict on teleworking as an energy-saving practice, there are numerous uncertainties and ambiguities about its actual or potential benefits. These relate to the extent to which teleworking may lead to unpredictable increases in non-work travel and home energy use that may outweigh the gains from reduced work travel. The available evidence suggests that economy-wide energy savings are typically modest, and in many circumstances could be negative or non-existent.",https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/AB8A84,article

Privacy is far too vague a concept to guide adjudication and lawmaking, as abstract incantations of the importance of ""privacy"" do not fare well when pitted against more concretely stated countervailing interests. In 1960, the famous torts scholar William Prosser attempted to make sense of the landscape of privacy law by identifying four different interests. But Prosser focused only on tort law, and the law of information privacy is significantly more vast and complex, extending to Fourth Amendment law, the constitutional right to information privacy, evidentiary privileges, dozens of federal privacy statutes, and hundreds of state statutes. Moreover, Prosser wrote over 40 years ago, and new technologies have given rise to a panoply of new privacy harms. A new taxonomy to understand privacy violations is thus sorely needed. This Article develops a taxonomy to identify privacy problems in a comprehensive and concrete manner. It endeavors to guide the law toward a more coherent understanding of privacy and to serve as a framework for the future development of the field of privacy law.",https://doi.org/10.2307/40041279,article

At the same time, utilization of new emerging technologies such as cloud computing, big data analytics, open data, social media, or Internet of Things has become more commonplace in recent years. This study aims to understand what determines ICT disparities and digital divides in the context of new technologies and digital world shifts. For this purpose, a theoretical framework of ICT-related indicators elucidating differences between the traditional and new approach is proposed. These ICT indicators were identified through the decomposition of related ICT and e-government indices together with explanatory factors derived from the literature. The European Union Member States were chosen as a sample for the exploratory analysis because of the availability of relevant indicators. More specifically, correlation, factor, regression, and cluster analyses were employed as empirical strategies to carry out this study. The Human Development Index together with research and development expenditure are the most important explanatory factors for the new approach, while the traditional set of indicators is still mostly correlated with the gross domestic product per capita. Finally, five clusters of Member States were identified and their implications for improving the use of ICT in the public sector are described.",https://doi.org/10.2478/REVECP-2022-0002,article

A total of 484 undergraduate students completed the questionnaire. The validity and reliability of the scale was statistically tested by computing the KMO and Bartlett tests and via an exploratory factor analysis, descriptive statistics, Cronbach's alpha, a confirmatory factor analysis and a multi-group invariance testing. The results of the principal components factor analysis show that the scale consists of the following four dimensions, with five items in each: environment, economy, society and education. The overall structure and measurement of the scale are confirmed by the confirmatory factor analysis and by the multi-group invariance testing. Internal reliability, which was found using Cronbach's alpha, varies between.660 and.854. The results show that the instrument meets the validity and reliability criteria. To demonstrate its utility, the scale was applied to detect differences in sustainable development attitudes among students pursuing degrees in psychology and in agriculture. Relevant differences were detected for the dimensions of environment and society. The Attitudes toward Sustainable Development scale could be useful for understanding the ways in which students think about sustainability issues and could be used to investigate the relationship between sustainability attitudes and other variables.",https://doi.org/10.1080/13504622.2016.1146660,article

These applications of technology can be noticed in education, transs portation, data storage, communications and healthcare, among other fields. The devell opment and use of digital technologies is also impacting how governments operate and function. Digital transformation, including artificial intelligence (AI) adoption, has become one of the highest priorities for public organisations. For instance, governments are increasingly trying to digitize their services through technology because of growing public expectations. But today, some governments are asked to do more: to create an enabling environment in which green, inclusive, equitable digital transformation strengthens democratic societies and economies. Several studies have indeed revealed critical digital competencies gaps in the public sector, including in the Global South. It is therefore extremely important to identify and address those digital transformation gaps and to succeed in the public sector, as a catalyst of change for societies and economies in digital age. While there is a growing literature on the types of digital comm petencies that public sector officials need, there is an unmet need to develop compree hensive digital competency frameworks that can: clearly identify the internal challenges a government faces in its digital transformation journey; propose specific competencies that can address those challenges, and: take into account some specificities of the Global South. The AI and Digital Transformation Competency Framework unpacks the major AI and digital transformation competencies needed in the public sector. The framework aims to provide guidance not just for civil servants, but for interrnational organisations and regional and national actors to support capacity development.

The notion inherited from the struggle (1970s-1980s) aims at legitimizing a political and economic structure which de facto implies the resilience of authoritarianism. Abyotawi democracy has been presented by EPRDF as the exact opposite of liberalism and neoliberalism. As no article dedicated to a review and engagement with EPRDF's abyotawi democracy has been written so far, this article aims at analysing this Ethiopian version of revolutionary democracy. The evolution and uses of the notion since 1991 reveal a ""bricolage"" that abyotawi democracy has been operating out of Leninism, Marxism, Maoism, and also liberalism.

Design/methodology/approach: This study investigates smartphone users' perception based on users' perceived adoption under the self-efficacy, technology acceptance model (TAM) and innovation attributes leading to an adoption attitude under innovation diffusion theory by providing research constructs for the domain of medical doctors and nurses, testing them with reliability and validity, and demonstrating their distinctiveness with hypothesis testing. Findings: The results indicate that behavioral intention to use was largely influenced by perceived usefulness (PU) and attitude toward using smartphone. PU and perceived ease of use positively determine attitude toward using smartphone. Research limitations/implications: For researchers, this study shows the possible and valuable adaptation of TAM constructs into the smartphone acceptance of doctors and nurses. The perceptions of smartphone adoption in this study are based on a one-time survey. For better reliability a longitudinal study to show the measurement of attitudes will be needed. Practical implications: One of the important implications is that organizational factors become a significant predictor of users' attitude toward innovative technologies. Originality/value: The domain of research, smartphone, is a new technology in some industries; thus smartphone adoption deserves investigation in its own right.

While advances in pervasive computing have led to the development of wireless and non-intrusive sensors that can capture the necessary activity information, current activity recognition approaches have so far experimented on either a scripted or pre-segmented sequence of sensor events related to activities. In this paper we propose and evaluate a sliding window based approach to perform activity recognition in an on line or streaming fashion; recognizing activities as and when new sensor events are recorded. To account for the fact that different activities can be best characterized by different window lengths of sensor events, we incorporate the time decay and mutual information based weighting of sensor events within a window. Additional contextual information in the form of the previous activity and the activity of the previous window is also appended to the feature describing a sensor window. The experiments conducted to evaluate these techniques on real-world smart home datasets suggests that combining mutual information based weighting of sensor events and adding past contextual information to the feature leads to best performance for streaming activity recognition. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.PMCJ.2012.07.003,article

While the smart citizen is most often seen as a kind of foil for those more stereotypically top-down, neoliberal and repressive visions of the smart city that have been widely critiqued within the literature, this paper argues for an attention to the ‘actually existing smart citizen', who plays a much messier and more ambivalent role in practice. This paper proposes the dual figures of ‘the general citizen' and ‘the absent citizen' as a heuristic for thinking about how the lines of inclusion and exclusion are drawn for citizens, both discursively and materially, in the actual making of the smart city. These figures are meant to highlight how the universal and unspecified figure of ‘the citizen' is discursively deployed to justify smart city policies, while at the same time, actual citizens remain largely excluded from such decision and policy-making processes. Using a case study of Atlanta, Georgia and its ongoing smart cities initiatives, we argue that while the participation of citizens is crucial to any truly democratic mode of urban governance, the emerging discourse around the promise of smart citizenship fails to capture the realities of how citizens are actually discussed and enrolled in the making of these policies.",https://doi.org/10.1080/13604813.2019.1575115,article

The possession of electronic gadgets, smooth internet connectivity, and other forms of digital communication can have a wide gap in availability among countries. This gap is mostly influenced by factors that are of infrastructural, political, cultural, demographical, generational, and socioeconomic nature. On account of developed and developing countries, the gap is disseminated and thoroughly complex. Although the developed nations around the globe proved to have narrowed digital divide as a major source of development and advancement in respective countries, it is quite challenging for emerging economies to adhere to the same processes for development. For an emerging economy, the prudent cost-benefit analysis carried out by the government can have varying effects on undertaking projects related to minimizing the digital divide. Nevertheless, the importance of narrowing the gap of the digital divide is unparalleled, and governments of emerging economies are realizing the benefits of it and investing their resources accordingly. Furthermore, information technology can be a catalyst in facilitating processes that save a lot of costs, bring holistic quality improvements, and implement effective and efficient government policies that lead to digitalization and sustainable consumption of resources. Consequently, governments are getting actively involved in the digitalization of their respective countries to turn their smart cities into more intelligent ones. Even so, it is important to understand that taking one policy to address all citizens is not realistic. Hence, understanding the foundational knowledge of the citizens, the demand of the population under various sectors, framing well-rounded policies with alternatives, and effectively and efficiently implementing them are extremely crucial.",https://doi.org/10.1108/978-1-80455-640-520231009,article

Two dimensions of administrative innovation are examined: management and technology. Management innovation refers to procedures and methods by which policies are implemented. Technology innovation refers to the adoption of new physical products or processes. Multiple indicators of specific innovative practices are used to create a management scale and a technology scale and the two scales are then combined to create a composite administration innovation scale. In order to explain the dimensions of innovation the study employs a model comprised of three sets of independent variables: community variables, political system variables, and bureaucratic variables. Multiple regression analysis is used to examine the relationship between each set of independent variables and the dimensions of innovation. A second stage of analysis combines the three sets of explanatory variables into a single equation for each type of innovation. The results indicate that the three sets of variables are of significant power in explaining innovation, although as one moves from community variables to political variables to bureaucratic variables there is a decline in the amount of variation explained. Some variables are more important for certain types of innovation than for others, but population size, community growth rate, and electoral competition cut across the various types of innovation. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1080/01900698508524487,article

The primary impulse for writing the article was the ambition to identify the current advanced technologies of Smart City management. The aim of the article is to propose a general model for the implementation of advanced technologies for Smart City management, based on the knowledge gained from the analysis of literature and case studies. In order to fulfill the set goal, it is necessary to obtain answers to two research questions. The findings were obtained through a secondary analysis of the literature, i.e., relevant articles from the scientific databases Web of Science and Scopus analysis of case studies of the best Smart Cities practices. According to the Smart City Index 2020 and IESE Cities in Motion, the leaders among the Smart Cities are Singapore and London, followed by Helsinki. In addition to the analyses, the article also uses methods of summarization, comparison, creativity, logic, induction and deduction. Smart Cities use 12 identified advanced technologies in their practice. Strategic management in Singapore, London and Helsinki adapts technology to the needs and requirements of its citizens, thus connecting the technological aspect with the managerial and social aspects. The contributions of the work include results for fellow researchers and a model for strategic management of new Smart Cities. The results of the article provide fellow researchers with the findings of a secondary analysis of relevant articles, from which they can draw when writing their own publications without the need for time-consuming search of the articles about this topic in databases. The general model of implementation of advanced technologies serves as a basis for strategic management of new Smart Cities that want to implement a technological base and at the same time do not want to forget the managerial and social aspects. Testing the model in practice with a new Slovak Smart City is part of future research activities.",https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13105746,article

Making cities more sustainable is a global priority, which is highlighted by ‘Sustainable Cities and Communities' being listed as one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) adopted by United Nations Member States in 2015. This Virtual Special Issue (VSI) explores the implementation and assessment of policies and technologies that contribute to the transition to a sustainable, energy efficient and regenerative society. We organized the issue according to four main research themes: 1) Renewable Energy Systems (i.e., different types of systems, qualitative assessments and public acceptance); 2) Sustainable Built Environment (which includes construction, operation and refurbishment); 3) Multi-Scale Models (considering urban sustainability transition from building to districts, or cities and regions to multi-country comparisons and their scaling across different countries); and 4) Governance and Policy (climate change mitigation and adaptation plans/policies that are reported across countries, urban services and infrastructures). This paper serves two purposes. The first is to provide an analysis about patterns, correlations and synergies found across the different topics that have been addressed over the last 20 years in the literature about cities' sustainability paths. A bibliometric analysis and a contingency matrix show the degree of correlation between scientific journals and main topics addressed by published articles. Secondly, the paper acts as an Editorial to the VSI, introducing the wealth of research articles and topics included in it. Both the bibliometric analysis and the papers published in this VSI demonstrate the interconnectedness of energy consumption, pollutant emissions and the competition for finite resources. The aim is to present advances and challenges of this exciting and ever-evolving research field to inform and guide future studies of urban sustainability.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2020.109788,article

Today, many government administrations have set up public participation processes as one more of the inputs required to make a decision on several aspects of governance. e-Participation initiatives make it easier for citizens to access such processes. At the present time, there is no clear and accepted field definition due to the wide diversity of theoretical proposals and the interdisciplinary nature of the initiatives, many of which have been developed ad-hoc. This paper reviews the present literature in the field of e-Participation by means of a systematic mapping of the research work carried out in the timeframe 2000-2019, together with some earlier relevant proposals in the area, with the aim of obtaining a conceptual guide to e-Participation components. This review analyses the findings and clusters the results into a conceptual e-Participation framework, which we call ePfw. The results show the diversity of the conceptualizations of many authors (25% on average) in the identification of tools, areas and levels in the field of e-participation and the almost null incorporation of fundamental aspects like trust, security, or transparency.

This version, called cumulative prospect theory, applies to uncertain as well as to risky prospects with any number of outcomes, and it allows different weighting functions for gains and for losses. Two principles, diminishing sensitivity and loss aversion, are invoked to explain the characteristic curvature of the value function and the weighting functions. A review of the experimental evidence and the results of a new experiment confirm a distinctive fourfold pattern of risk attitudes: risk aversion for gains and risk seeking for losses of high probability; risk seeking for gains and risk aversion for losses of low probability.

"Kaaronen, Roope O.",2017.0,{Affording sustainability: Adopting a theory of affordances as a guiding heuristic for environmental policy,"Human behavior is an underlying cause for many of the ecological crises faced in the 21st century, and there is no escaping from the fact that widespread behavior change is necessary for socio-ecological systems to take a sustainable turn. Whilst making people and communities behave sustainably is a fundamental objective for environmental policy, behavior change interventions and policies are often implemented from a very limited non-systemic perspective. Environmental policy-makers and psychologists alike often reduce cognition 'to the brain,' focusing only to a minor extent on how everyday environments systemically afford pro-environmental behavior. Symptomatic of this are the widely prevalent attitude-action, value-action or knowledge-action gaps, understood in this paper as the gulfs lying between sustainable thinking and behavior due to lack of affordances. I suggest that by adopting a theory of affordances as a guiding heuristic, environmental policy-makers are better equipped to promote policies that translate sustainable thinking into sustainable behavior, often self-reinforcingly, and have better conceptual tools to nudge our socio-ecological system toward a sustainable turn. Affordance theory, which studies the relations between abilities to perceive and act and environmental features, is shown to provide a systemic framework for analyzing environmental policies and the ecology of human behavior. This facilitates the location and activation of leverage points for systemic policy interventions, which can help socio-ecological systems to learn to adapt to more sustainable habits. Affordance theory is presented to be applicable and pertinent to technically all nested levels of socio-ecological systems from the studies of sustainable objects and households to sustainable urban environments, making it an immensely versatile conceptual policy tool. Finally, affordance theory is also discussed from a participatory perspective. Increasing the fit between local thinking and external behavior possibilities entails a deep understanding of tacit and explicit attitudes, values, knowledge as well as physical and social environments, best gained via inclusive and polycentric policy approaches.",https://doi.org/10.3389/FPSYG.2017.01974,article
"Initiative, Impact",2018.0,{African Regional Health Report 2014 The health of the people,"There is a well documented association between poverty and tuberculosis. Not only are the poor more likely to get TB disease, but they are also more likely to face barriers in accessing care. In addition, the economic burden of TB (loss of wages, out-of-pocket expenses for seeking care and loss of productive years of life) makes the poor people even poorer. The vision of the TB and Poverty Subgroup of the Stop TB Partnership is: ""A world where the poor and most vulnerable are protected from TB and have easy and equitable access to quality care"". As an initiative of the Stop TB Partnership, TB REACH is focussed on the poor and vulnerable. In addition to focussing on countries with per capita GNI of $2000, or less, TB REACH also welcomes applications that target poverty pockets within countries that have a per capita GNI between $2000 and $3000 and poverty pockets within the remaining high TB burden countries. TB REACH recognizes that due to socioeconomic disparities there are often well known sub-national population that live under substantially higher levels of poverty in these countries. These poverty pockets are vulnerable to TB and often face limited access to TB care. What is poverty? Poverty is the lack of basic human needs, such as clean water, nutrition, health care, education, clothing and shelter, because of the inability to afford them. In 1998 a UN Statement on poverty, signed by the heads of all UN agencies stated: ""Fundamentally, poverty is a denial of choices and opportunities, a violation of human dignity. It means lack of basic capacity to participate effectively in society. It means not having enough to feed and cloth a family, not having a school or clinic to go to, not having the land on which to grow one's food or a job to earn one's living, not having access to credit. It means insecurity, powerlessness and exclusion of individuals, households and communities. It means susceptibility to violence, and it often implies living on marginal or fragile environments, without access to clean water or sanitation"".",https://doi.org/10.1093/bmb/ldh005,techreport

Four case studies from Ethiopia, Kenya, and South Africa show how different presses adapt their practices and adopt new technologies. Interpreted through an institutional logics perspective, the status of the university presses is described according to established editorial and market logics, to which a third, hypothetical logic of the knowledge commons is added. The logic of the knowledge commons accounts for changes advanced by the digitization of content, peer‐to‐peer networks as the basis for production, the rise of open access, and an emerging social capitalism. In two cases, we find university presses constrained by traditional editorial logics, while a third one exhibits a hybrid editorial–market model with the purposive adoption of new technologies. Only the fourth, recently established press has embraced the new logic of the knowledge commons wholeheartedly. Thus, if there is a second transition of the academic publishing industry underway, it is in its early stages, partial, and limited in the African context. We thus show that the logic of the knowledge commons provides a useful theoretical lens for studying the far‐reaching and rapid ongoing changes in international academic publishing in Africa and further afield.</p>",https://doi.org/10.1002/LEAP.1187),article

However, little is known about how users understand the interplay between identity and algorithmic processes on these platforms, and if and how such understandings shape their behavior on these platforms in return. Through semi-structured interviews with 15 US-based TikTok users, we detail users' algorithmic folk theories of the For You Page algorithm in relation to two inter-connected identity types: person and social identity. Participants identified potential harms that can accompany algorithms' tailoring content to their person identities. Further, they believed the algorithm actively suppresses content related to marginalized social identities based on race and ethnicity, body size and physical appearance, ability status, class status, LGBTQ identity, and political and social justice group affiliation. We propose a new algorithmic folk theory of social feeds-The Identity Strainer Theory-to describe when users believe an algorithm filters out and suppresses certain social identities. In developing this theory, we introduce the concept of algorithmic privilege as held by users positioned to benefit from algorithms on the basis of their identities. We further propose the concept of algorithmic representational harm to refer to the harm users experience when they lack algorithmic privilege and are subjected to algorithmic symbolic annihilation. Additionally, we describe how participants changed their behaviors to shape their algorithmic identities to align with how they understood themselves, as well as to resist the suppression of marginalized social identities and lack of algorithmic privilege via individual actions, collective actions, and altering their performances. We theorize our findings to detail the ways the platform's algorithm and its users co-produce knowledge of identity on the platform. We argue the relationship between users' algorithmic folk theories and identity are consequential for social media platforms, as it impacts users' experiences, behaviors, sense of belonging, and perceived ability to be seen, heard, and feel valued by others as mediated through algorithmic systems.",https://doi.org/10.1145/3476046,article

As a contribution to this research, this article presents an algebra for spatiotemporal data. Algebras give formal specifications at a high-level abstraction, independently of programming languages. This helps to develop reliable and expressive applications. Our algebra specifies three data types as generic abstractions built on real-world observations: time series, trajectory and coverage.

"Fia, Tommaso",2021.0,{An Alternative to Data Ownership: Managing Access to Non-Personal Data through the Commons,"In today's algorithmic society, access to large-scale datasets is the sine qua non for any economic actor to reap the benefits of data-driven innovation (DDI). This article explores alternative mechanisms of data management in large-scale processing environments which can bolster access in view of the shortcomings of the existing data ownership-centric system. The scope of the analysis is limited to non-personal data. First, this contribution elaborates on the features and shortcomings of the data ownership-centric system and the existing legislation on data access. In fact, despite its ground-breaking potential, data access is not a widely available resource. It is subject, meanwhile, to the ability of several actors to control it, originating from data holders' position of de facto control over data (""data ownership""), which is mostly anchored in technological, behavioural, and legal access barriers. This ownership-oriented setting thus stifles data sharing and opportunities for novel reuses of data. Despite these concerns, EU secondary legislation and case law (including the ""essential facilities doctrine""of competition law) have not yet offered appropriate means to enable data access across society. Second, this article investigates whether alternative systems of data management based on the commons is a viable solution to open up access to raw non-personal data (RNPD). The commons as a conceptual notion and institutional mechanism values access and freedom to operate, instead of power to appropriate. The article homes in on two main reasons which substantiate why commons management of RNPD can be desirable. On the one hand, RNPD can be deemed a cooperative infrastructural resource that calls for being pulled out of its factual enclosure (""structuralist approach""of the commons). On the other hand, grasping RNPD as a commons means valuing its functional nature, making data available to a wide number of actors for the fulfilment of fundamental rights and enhancing human flourishing (""functionalist approach""). The article concludes with some thoughts on the lines of research which are still to be explored to put the commons-based vision of data management into practice.",https://doi.org/10.1515/GJ-2020-0034,article

"Wang, Jin and Gao, Yu and Yin, Xiang and Li, Feng and Kim, Hye Jin",2018.0,{An Enhanced PEGASIS Algorithm with Mobile Sink Support for Wireless Sensor Networks,"Energy efficiency has been a hot research topic for many years and many routing algorithms have been proposed to improve energy efficiency and to prolong lifetime for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Since nodes close to the sink usually need to consume more energy to forward data of its neighbours to sink, they will exhaust energy more quickly. These nodes are called hot spot nodes and we call this phenomenon hot spot problem. In this paper, an Enhanced Power Efficient Gathering in Sensor Information Systems (EPEGASIS) algorithm is proposed to alleviate the hot spots problem from four aspects. Firstly, optimal communication distance is determined to reduce the energy consumption during transmission.

The paper empirically tests the proposed extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (e-UTAUT) model in the students' intention and use behavior toward the online learning system. Understanding the acceptance of online learning technology is crucial, especially among developing countries caught off-guard by the abrupt transition of face-to-face classes to pure online learning. The enjoyment, interactivity, flexibility, and quality of online learning systems were added as antecedent variables to the UTAUT model. Eight hundred eighty valid responses from selected college students in the Visayas regions, Philippines, were collected. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to verify the research hypotheses. The results supported the proposed model with acceptable fit measures and substantial explanatory power. The extended constructs provide different views on online learning based on the significant cluster of antecedents to explain technology acceptance through behavioral intentions and actual system usage. The paper implies that despite the challenges of connectivity in developing countries, the variations still conform with emerging literature about the topic. Insights for higher education institutions and policy directions are recommended.",https://doi.org/10.3389/FRAI.2022.768831,article
"Kelly, Rita Mae",1998.0,"{An Inclusive Democratic Polity, Representative Bureaucracies, and the New Public Management","Public administration scholars separate over whether the public bureaucracy or the democratic polity ought to be the starting point of public admin-istration scholarship. Dwight Waldo (1948), John J. Kirlin (1996), and Vincent Ostrom (1997) among others, have argued that the democratic polity needs preference and that focusing predominantly on improving efficiency of administrative processes can in fact harm the very polity that such improvements are supposed to help. Procedural due process, sub-stantive rights, equity, and protection of minority rights as well as equal opportunity and equality among citizens are values that have precedence over efficiency. They argue, and I agree, that a particular public bureaucracy or administrative structure is embedded within a particular political socioeconom-ic system. If the result desired is an inclusive, demo-cratic polity, then these organizations ought to be grounded in theories, assumptions, and understand-ings of reality that advance knowledge of, and give direction toward, attaining such a polity. Grounded in rational choice and public choice and containing elements of Total Quality Manage-ment (TQM), the New Public Management (NPM) seeks to offer more efficient mechanisms for deliver-ing goods and services and for raising governmental performance levels. Such a goal would appear to be highly commendable and desired by all citizens. As Parsons, Merrick, and Watson (1996, 26) in their study of Deep South mayors note, ""The social con-tract, in large part, is about the equitable distribution of city resources."" The Civil Rights Movement con-cerned equal services in terms of sewers, paved roads, and street lights as well as equality in voting, jobs, and education. -^ The purpose of this article is to examine the impli-cations of the new public management movement for representative bureaucracies and the development of an inclusive democratic polity. In examining these matters, I will first define an inclusive democratic polity and examine the extent to which the theory and assumptions that undergird the New Public Management are likely to provide guidance to those implementing it should they wish to promote an inclusive democratic polity. Since the NPM is largely derived from rational choice and public choice theo-ries, I will focus primarily on them. 201 However, I will also note briefly how TQM has modified these theories. After assessing these theoretical issues, I will then discuss the meaning and rationale for a representative bureaucracy. Once these basic concepts are articulated, I will suggest how a representa-tive bureaucracy might assist in resolving the problems facing the NPM as the result of trying to apply private sector and market concepts to the public sector.",https://doi.org/10.2307/976560,article

With the increasing availability of satellite imagery and other remote sensing data, deep learning algorithms can be used and trained to detect, classify, and segment flood regions in real time. In addition, deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been successful in this field, enabling the automated analysis of vast amounts of satellite imagery. By combining AI-based flood detection with other data sources, such as meteorological forecasts and ground-based sensors, comprehensive flood monitoring systems that provide early warning of flood events and facilitate effective emergency response can be developed. In this article, we developed an image-based flood segmentation system called DeepLab that uses a deep learning algorithm to detect and segment the presence and extent of floods with high accuracy and speed. The neural network was trained on an extensive collection of satellite images, which were complemented by ground truth labels that indicated the presence of flooded areas. The trained DeepLabv3 model is applied to new satellite images during inference to forecast the likelihood of each pixel belonging to a flooded area. To do this, a binary flood map was generated from the pixel-level forecasts by incorporating a threshold into the output probabilities. The proposed system's accuracy was high compared to the state-of-the-art methods, as evidenced by segmentation and experimental results. The segmentation accuracy achieved an overall score of 87%.",https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2023.3308564,article

"Lee, Gwanhoo and Kwak, Young Hoon",2012.0,{An Open Government Maturity Model for social media-based public engagement,"Social media has opened up unprecedented new possibilities of engaging the public in government work. In response to the Open Government Directive, U.S. federal agencies developed their open government plan and launched numerous social media-based public engagement initiatives. However, we find that many of these initiatives do not deliver the intended outcomes due to various organizational, technological, and financial challenges. We propose an Open Government Maturity Model based on our field studies with U.S. federal healthcare administration agencies. This model is specifically developed to assess and guide open government initiatives which focus on transparent, interactive, participatory, collaborative public engagement that are largely enabled by emerging technologies such as social media. The model consists of five maturity levels: initial conditions (Level 1), data transparency (Level 2), open participation (Level 3), open collaboration (Level 4), and ubiquitous engagement (Level 5). We argue that there is a logical sequence for increasing social media-based public engagement and agencies should focus on achieving one maturity level at a time. The Open Government Maturity Model helps government agencies implement their open government initiatives effectively by building organizational and technological capabilities in an orderly manner. We discuss challenges and best practices for each maturity level and conclude by presenting recommendations. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.GIQ.2012.06.001,article

Many of the technologies were used as an aid for fulfilling human needs and mitigating many of the problems associated with the environment and making everyone connected. In order to mitigate the problem of rapid urbanization smart city concept has emerged and it is being used to streamline the functions of urban cities and make the lives of citizens more easy and convenient. In a typical smart city context, citizens are already interconnected via smart mobile devices and wearable devices. The hospitals, vehicles, houses, traffic surveillance systems, public places, and other social systems in the city are all connected over the Internet, which is known as the Internet of Things (IoT). This will contribute to unprecedented changes in the condition of life in the city. In public care, public safety, emergency management, and disaster recovery, these pervasive systems which are linked through the Internet can assist citizens with greater benefits. The world is now witnessing a boom of smart cities. Although smart cities have many advantages, such as creating new economic and social possibilities, there are many challenges, such as security and privacy. These security and privacy challenges include unauthorized access to information and attacks that cause physical interruptions in the provision of city services. As all people in the city are linked to each other through the underlying ubiquitous communication technologies in the smart city, security problems can arise as a result of the vulnerabilities present in the city infrastructure, communication networks, and human errors. Different applications used in smart cities can also present new vulnerabilities, so the attackers can gain access to information which is highly confidential.

All these components interact in real time to provide an educational setting where the student learn to develop Java programs. The recommender system is an E-Learning 3.0 software component that recommends new exercises to a student based on the actions (ratings) of previous learners. The affect recognizer analyze pictures of the student to recognize learning-centered emotions (frustration, boredom, engagement, and excitement) that are used to provide personalized instruction. Sentiment text analysis determines the quality of the programming exercises based on the opinions of the students. The authoring tool is used to create new exercises with no programming work. We conducted two evaluations: one evaluation used the Technology Acceptance Model to assess the impact of our software tool on student behavior.

In this article, we develop an agent-based financing model for post-earthquake housing recovery. We focus on single-family, owner-occupied homes. The model includes funding from earthquake insurance, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Small Business Administration, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, private banks, Non-Governmental Organizations, and personal savings. We present a case study investigating the housing recovery financing in the economically diverse city of San Jose, California, following a hypothetical 7.0 Mw earthquake. By including the financial model in housing recovery simulations, we quantify inequalities in recovery time and total reconstruction completion between income groups. We complement the case study by evaluating several strategies to reduce these disparities and show that a combination of income-targeted funding and redistribution of construction crews can reduce inequalities in regional housing recovery.",https://doi.org/10.1177/87552930211064319,article

In this paper, we address this promising approach to analyze the impact of collaborative Web 2.0 tools applied to PPGIS applications in urban planning actions. We develop a Web 2.0 PPGIS application through free, easy-to-use tools, which consist of a Web mapping service, with eligible geospatial data layers, where users explore and comment. A database stores the contributions in a format supported by GIS. We also set up a prototype version in Canela (Brazil), to test its usability. The results showed that it is a valuable approach for engaging the public. It could promote communication among users and decision makers in a more interactive and straightforward way. Besides, it is easy to set up and understandable by non-experts.

The approaches to this task can largely be divided into two categories: filter-based and wrapper-based methods. Generally, the latter produces better results than the former with regard to given learning methods, though it consumes more computational resources for searches over the feature subset space. In this paper, we propose an Efficient wRapper based on a Paired t-Test (ERPT) for choosing features from large-scale data consisting of thousands of variables, such as microarrays. Statistical tests are a reasonable option when the number of features is very large because they have more predictable behavior and can be more efficient than most search methods. The proposed method consists of two phases: decrement phase and increment phase. In the decrement phase, it selects strongly relevant features. In the increment phase, it adds weakly relevant features, given the previously selected features. Our method, combined with naive Bayes classifiers, has been tested in an extensive set of experiments on University of California Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository data. The results showed that the performance of the proposed method is comparable to that of the backward search-based wrapper and superior to that of the forward search-based wrapper. Furthermore, it demonstrated much better performance than the forward search-based wrapper when applied to three microarray data sets, for which the backward search-based wrapper was impractical because of the computational burden involved. The proposed method has the following three merits: (1) it is applicable to data sets having thousands of variables, (2) it provides a theoretically sound and controllable criterion for thresholding features, and (3) it finds feature subsets for the maximizing of classification performance on sparse domains. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.PROCS.2013.10.014,article

We conducted an in-depth field study of nine software development teams that included 132 ethnographic initial interviews, periods of team observation, 19 follow-up interviews, and team meetings. Inductive analysis of the data led us to develop an embedded model of cultural adaptation in global teams to describe the process we observed as teams attempted to cope with important differences in interpersonal communication styles, preferred approaches to organizational control and authority relations, and workrelated knowledge and problem-solving approaches. We show how local embeddedness and interdependence across sites together drive cultural adaptation dialectics as actors attempt to resolve rippling tensions within and across nested social structures. The model of cultural adaptation that we developed as an outcome of our research challenges literature that assumes adaptation can be contained within a team and is distinctive in incorporating a dynamic systems view of culture. We build on and develop theory concerning multilevel structuration dynamics.

The findings with respect to 29 cases of social innovation initiatives for environmental sustainability across 9 domains suggest that a large spectrum of sustainability challenges and topics are addressed by existing initiatives, which in turn can refer to different urban spatialities. For each initiative we examine the social innovation process, focusing on the types of involved organizations, the underlying innovation mechanisms as well as the use of technology. In terms of citizen empowerment, we examine the empowerment mode, the main beneficiaries of the innovation, as well as the specific outcome of the initiative.

As of 2017, more than 1000 cities in the world have commenced smart city developments, half of which are in China. However, there is not a uniform and clear understanding of smart city systems; this may affect their evaluation/planning and lead to misguided construction. Smart cities are characterized by complex self-organizing systems, and thus their sustainable and healthy development may require following the evolutionary patterns of such systems. Hence, self-organizing system theory may be useful in explaining such cities. Therefore, this paper first performs secondary qualitative data analyses of previous attempts at characterizing smart city development to identify the most robust aspects tested in previous work. Then, incorporating the results, self-organization theory is used to develop an overall, comprehensive system framework of smart cities. In this framework, all types of smart devices are the basic units of development (defined as “smart cells”). Meanwhile, Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and developmental mechanisms offer technical support and regulatory mechanisms in the spontaneous operation of smart cities.

Meanwhile, the use of technology to provide counseling and support in the substance abuse field is exploding. Despite the increase in the use of technology in treatment, little is known about the impact of technology-supported interventions on access to services for substance use disorders. The E-TREAT intervention brings together the evidence-based practice of Motivational Interviewing and theories of Persuasive Technology to sustain clients' motivation to change substance use behaviors, provide support for change, and facilitate continuity across treatment settings.Methods: This study used descriptive statistics, tests of statistical significance, and logistic regression to explore the characteristics and perceptions of the first 157 people who agreed to participate in E-TREAT and the predictors of their active engagement in E-TREAT services. In addition, responses to open-ended questions about the participants' experiences with the intervention were analyzed.Results: The data reveal that clients who engaged in E-TREAT were more likely than those who did not engage to be female, have children and report a positive relationship with their recovery coach, and were less likely to have completed treatment for a substance use disorder in the past. A majority of people engaging in E-TREAT reported that it was helpful to talk with others with similar problems and that the program assisted them in developing a sense of community.Conclusions: The authors conclude that technology-assisted interventions hold promise in expanding access to treatment for substance use disorders especially for women and parents. Further, the characteristics of the relationship with a coach or helper may be critical to engagement in technology-supported interventions. Additional investigation into ways technology may be useful to enhance treatment access for certain subgroups is needed. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1186/1747-597X-5-10,article

The benefits may include reduced corruption, increased transparency, greater convenience, higher revenues, and lower costs. The current E-Government 2.0 describes user-oriented portal services that are integrated into and provided through one portal site using Web 2.0 technologies, such as RSS, blogs, social networks, etc.; and that are accessible from various channels. However, building E-Government 2.0 is difficult because the transition from E-Government to E-Government 2.0 should be an organizational integration agenda, not only a technology one. Agencies may encounter many unpredictable design challenges and tensions that must be managed. Governments are now beginning to focus on the larger and more holistic task of service innovation in order to provide more productive and better services. One of the key observations about making progress with service innovation is that agencies need a framework to help them move forward. Our objective in this study is to propose a novel implementation framework for E-Government 2.0. This framework integrates the processes, resources, back offices, and front offices of online systems to carry out the stakeholder-oriented participatory E-Government 2.0.

"Talaat, Fatma M. and ZainEldin, Hanaa",2023.0,{An improved fire detection approach based on YOLO-v8 for smart cities,"Fires in smart cities can have devastating consequences, causing damage to property, and endangering the lives of citizens. Traditional fire detection methods have limitations in terms of accuracy and speed, making it challenging to detect fires in real time. This paper proposes an improved fire detection approach for smart cities based on the YOLOv8 algorithm, called the smart fire detection system (SFDS), which leverages the strengths of deep learning to detect fire-specific features in real time. The SFDS approach has the potential to improve the accuracy of fire detection, reduce false alarms, and be cost-effective compared to traditional fire detection methods. It can also be extended to detect other objects of interest in smart cities, such as gas leaks or flooding. The proposed framework for a smart city consists of four primary layers: (i) Application layer, (ii) Fog layer, (iii) Cloud layer, and (iv) IoT layer. The proposed algorithm utilizes Fog and Cloud computing, along with the IoT layer, to collect and process data in real time, enabling faster response times and reducing the risk of damage to property and human life. The SFDS achieved state-of-the-art performance in terms of both precision and recall, with a high precision rate of 97.1% for all classes. The proposed approach has several potential applications, including fire safety management in public areas, forest fire monitoring, and intelligent security systems.",https://doi.org/10.1007/S00521-023-08809-1,article

Using institutional theory as an analytical perspective, this study documents and evaluates the development of an anti-corruption system called OPEN (Online Procedures ENhancement for civil application) in the Seoul Metropolitan Government. Incorporating three distinctive (yet interrelated) dimensions of institutionalization (regulatory/coercive, cognitive/mimetic, and normative), and four anti-corruption strategies embedded in the system, this study investigates how an e-government system for anti-corruption in a local government has evolved and become a prototype of a national system to be used for the same purpose. The findings show that in implementing OPEN, a system for anti-corruption, the regulatory dimension was most effective, and (as in many IS implementations) strong leadership was crucial to its success. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.giq.2008.09.002,article

This is due to cities' attention in supporting smart and sustainable urbanism practices. In an era of digitalization of urban services and processes, which is upon us, platform urbanism is becoming a fundamental tool to support smart urban governance, and helping in the formation of a new version of cities—i.e., City 4.0. This new version utilizes urban dashboards and platforms in its operations and management tasks of its complex urban metabolism. These intelligent systems help in maintaining the robustness of our cities, integrating various sensors (e.g., internet-of-things) and big data analysis technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence) with the aim of optimizing urban infrastructures and services (e.g., water, waste, energy), and turning the urban system into a smart one. The study generates insights from the sensor city best practices by placing some of renowned projects, implemented by Huawei, Cisco, Google, Ericsson, Microsoft, and Alibaba, under the microscope. The investigation findings reveal that the sensor city approach: (a) Has the potential to increase the smartness and sustainability level of cities; (b) Manages to engage citizens and companies in the process of planning, monitoring and analyzing urban processes; (c) Raises awareness on the local environmental, social and economic issues, and; (d) Provides a novel city blueprint for urban administrators, managers and planners. Nonetheless, the use of advanced technologies—e.g., real-time monitoring stations, cloud computing, surveillance cameras—poses a multitude of challenges related to: (a) Quality of the data used; (b) Level of protection of traditional and cybernetic urban security; (c) Necessary integration between the various urban infrastructure, and; (d) Ability to transform feedback from stakeholders into innovative urban policies.",https://doi.org/10.3390/s20164391,techreport

Smart vehicles have played a significant role in the advancement of intelligent and connected transportation systems. Continuous vehicular cloud service availability in smart cities is becoming a crucial subscriber necessity which requires improvement in the vehicular service management architecture. Moreover, as smart cities continue to deploy diversified technologies to achieve assorted and high-performance cloud services, security issues with regards to communicating entities which share personal requester information still prevails. To mitigate these concerns, we introduce an automated secure continuous cloud service availability framework for smart connected vehicles that enables an intrusion detection mechanism against security attacks and provides services that meet users' quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE) requirements. Continuous service availability is achieved by clustering smart vehicles into service-specific clusters. Cluster heads are selected for communication purposes with trusted third-party entities (TTPs) acting as mediators between service requesters and providers. The most optimal services are then delivered from the selected service providers to the requesters. Furthermore, intrusion detection is accomplished through a three-phase data traffic analysis, reduction, and classification technique used to identify positive trusted service requests against false requests that may occur during intrusion attacks. The solution adopts deep belief and decision tree machine learning mechanisms used for data reduction and classification purposes, respectively. The framework is validated through simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution in terms of intrusion attack detection. The proposed solution achieved an overall accuracy of 99.43% with 99.92% detection rate and 0.96% false positive and false negative rate of 1.53%.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.ADHOC.2019.02.001,article

In particular, given that public value is rooted in democratic theory and new technologies that promote networking spaces have emerged, citizen participation represents one of the principal instruments to make government open and close to the citizenry needs. Participation in urban governance has undergone a great development: from the first postmodernist ideals of countering expert dominance to today's focus on learning and social innovation, where citizen participation is conceptualized as co-creation and co-production. Despite this development, there is a lack of research to know how this new governance context is taking place in the SC arena. Addressing this situation, in this article, we present an exhaustive survey of the research literature and a deep study of the experience in participative initiatives followed by SCs in Europe. Through an analysis of 149 SC initiatives from 76 European cities, we provide interesting insights about how participatory models have been introduced in the different areas and dimensions of the cities, how citizen engagement is promoted in SC initiatives, and whether the so-called creative SCs are those with a higher number of projects governed in a participatory way.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0894439319877478,article

Also, trust in e-government extended the Theory of Reasoned Action in predicting the intention to use e-government.
Design/methodology/approach – Proposed a model and tried to empirically test it using a sample of 759 Jordanians who filled a survey consisting of items measuring the previously mentioned constructs. A structural equation modeling technique was used to test the model.
Findings – Results supported the proposed research model, where all proposed variables significantly predicted intention to use e-government services. Also, a partial least squares estimate of the model indicated a significant prediction of trust in e-government by all proposed variables except the Internet familiarity construct. The coefficient of determination for intention to use was 0.465, and for trust in e-government 0.415.
Research limitations/implications – The study utilized a newly developed instrument in Arabic, and diverse categories of subjects, where some of them were considering a public e-learning system when responding to items.
Practical implications – This research is important to public officials and the Jordanian e-government project, as it emphasized the importance of trust constructs (TiT and TiG) as major influencers on the trust propensity related to e-government. Also, other constructs like information quality showed significant influence; where the type and characteristics of information posted on e-government Web sites influence the adoption decision on the long run. Jordanians' perceptions regarding information posted on e-government Web site were all at moderate levels. More emphasis on making information more accurate, recent, comprehensive and original is needed.
Social implications – This study showed a relative deficiency in Jordanians perceptions towards trusting the Internet. It seems that they reflected a moderate trust in its legal, technical and security levels. Finally, this study emphasized the role of privacy and security issues in influencing the level of trust in e-government systems. Similarly, transparency and knowledge equity are important dimensions that need to be addressed.
Originality/value – This study is one of the largest studies with respect to the size of its sample that explores trust in e-government in Jordan. The focus on trust antecedents and the empirical test of the model is a first attempt in the literature, where a structural model was explored raising the level of accuracy of estimation to its required potential.

To cater to this, there is a need to develop and implement real-time flood management systems that could instantly detect flooded regions to initiate relief activities as early as possible. Current imaging systems, relying on satellites, have demonstrated low accuracy and delayed response, making them unreliable and impractical to be used in emergency responses to natural disasters such as flooding. This research employs Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to develop an automated imaging system that can identify inundated areas from aerial images. The Haar cascade classifier was explored in the case study to detect landmarks such as roads and buildings from the aerial images captured by UAVs and identify flooded areas. The extracted landmarks are added to the training dataset that is used to train a deep learning algorithm. Experimental results show that buildings and roads can be detected from the images with 91% and 94% accuracy, respectively. The overall accuracy of 91% is recorded in classifying flooded and non-flooded regions from the input case study images.

We explored the value of PROGRESS as an equity lens to assess effects of interventions on health equity. Study Design and Setting We assessed the utility of PROGRESS by using it in 11 systematic reviews and methodological studies published between 2008 and 2013. To develop the justification for each of the PROGRESS elements, we consulted experts to identify examples of unfair differences in disease burden and an intervention that can effectively address these health inequities. Results Each PROGRESS factor can be justified on the basis of unfair differences in disease burden and the potential for interventions to reduce these differential effects. We have not provided a rationale for why the difference exists but have attempted to explain why these differences may contribute to disadvantage and argue for their consideration in new evaluations, systematic reviews, and intervention implementation. Conclusion The acronym PROGRESS is a framework and aide-memoire that is useful in ensuring that an equity lens is applied in the conduct, reporting, and use of research. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.JCLINEPI.2013.08.005,article

Digital intermediaries are shared facilities where communities can visit and have access to information and communication technology (ICT) and the internet. Communities benefit economically, socially and politically by using free access to ICT and the internet from intermediaries' facilities to share information with the government. There seem to be disparities between the roles of the different stakeholders in information sharing. These disparities often result in poor communication between the government and communities, and also poor government services delivery. Objectives: This research investigated how intermediaries can enhance information sharing between government and communities in the Western Cape Province. Method: This study adopted a qualitative research approach by using semi-structured interviews. Purposive sampling was used to collect qualitative data from 15 participants from different intermediaries' staff in the Western Cape Province. A narrative analysis approach was used to analyse the data. Results: The study found that intermediaries intermediate between communities and the government by providing free access to ICTs, provide basic computer training and access to computing resources and serving as an information hub. The study also found that operating hours, lack of resources, skilled staff and communication challenges adversely affect information sharing. Conclusion: This study recommended that intermediaries are supported to increase the number of resources and facilities and the number and levels of training in the province to cater for more communities.

A close look at the usage rate of e-Government services such as online application, however, reveals that it is very low while online transaction is still rhetoric. This paper therefore assesses whether the high e-readiness index gives a true indication of the citizens' e-readiness using available secondary data sources. It further explores the factors facilitating and inhibiting citizens' e-readiness through the administration of a survey questionnaire. The main findings reveal that the barriers inhibiting citizens' e-readiness are resistance to change, absence of opportunities for e-participation and e-consultation, and lack of awareness. The main facilitators of citizens' e-readiness emanating from the analysis are awareness campaigns which tease out the advantages of online public services compared to traditional methods of service delivery, building of trust in government, and managing change. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.giq.2008.12.016,article

This technology-intensive use frequently comes with large investments in the ICT infrastructure necessary for smart city initiatives, which may not be financially viable in the long term. Financial sustainability (FS) is a useful framework for assessing how governments meet their financial obligations, using different indicators of financial performance over time by controlling for contextual factors. This study examines 1723 municipal governments; only 89 of these explicitly conducted smart-city initiatives in Mexico over three time points (2014, 2016, and 2018). Panel data techniques were applied to compare the effects of the investments in ICT infrastructure across municipalities with or without smart-city initiatives on five indicators related to the financial condition within the FS framework (i.e., cash solvency, budget solvency, long-term solvency, service-level solvency for revenues and expenses). The results show an association between ICT infrastructure and some dimensions of FS. The main findings suggest the importance of adequate financial analysis for long-term capital and budgeting decisions, to create a more solid smart city financial strategy for the long term.

So comes the natural question: has smart city construction improved the eco-efficiency of cities In China? How does the impact change over time? Is the impact heterogeneous across cities? Based on Green Solow model, this paper adopts the Super-efficiency SBM model to measure the eco-efficiency of 152 prefecture-level cities in China covering the period 2003-2016, and then DID model is applied to investigate the impact of smart city pilot policy on eco-efficiency. On the whole, the smart city construction significantly improves the eco-efficiency, and the multi-stage DID results reveal that the promotion effect is increasing over time due to the annual superposition. Furthermore, the impact is heterogeneous across cities. Although the promotion effect on medium-sized cities is less than that of large cities, the promotion effect has actually weakened when the urban population size exceeds 5 million. Moreover, the lower the level of city's economic development, the greater the role of smart city construction in promoting eco-efficiency.

In 2016, a survey was conducted on the 162 incubators active in Italy, and a total of 88 responses were received. An analysis of the literature and of this dataset led to the identification of three types of incubators: Business, Mixed, and Social. Thirty of the respondents sent information on their tenants. Thanks to the data regarding 247 tenants, it was possible to analyze the impact of the three different types of incubators (Business, Mixed, and Social) on the tenants' growth through OLS regression analyses. A Social Incubator is here defined as an incubator that supports more than 50% of start-ups that aim to introduce a positive social impact. The study shows that Social Incubators perceive social impact measurement and training/consulting on business ethics and CSR as being more important services than other incubator types.

Population growth has significantly reduced toilets through the waste management system. Laying garbage in public places creates a polluted environment. To eliminate or reduce waste and maintain good hygiene, it requires a waste-based waste management system. The need for proper waste management is not limited to proper collection and disposal of waste. It continues to be a waste disposal and recyclable level. Recycling is considered a major benefit because in addition to waste disposal, our reliance on immature materials is declining. By recycling metal, plastic and glass, the use of decomposing waste can extend beyond compost and manure.

Abstract: Environmental monitoring systems play a crucial role in assessing environmental quality, detecting limits exceedances, and predicting potential ecological episodes. These systems rely on the measurement of various variables at specific locations and time intervals over an extended period. The concept of environmental monitoring encompasses the assessment of health and safety issues for public and environmental health purposes. Pollution of the atmosphere and water, climate change, and natural disasters are among the consequences of continuous industrial and municipal development and human interference in natural ecosystems. To address these challenges and to protect human lives and the environment, with a special concern on mitigating the ecological effects of industrial development, advanced technical solutions, including the technologies associated with artificial intelligence (artificial neural networks ANNs, machine learning ML) have been developed. These technologies offer powerful tools for analysing the vast amount of data collected by monitoring systems and extracting valuable insights. By applying ANNs and machine learning algorithms, environmental monitoring systems can effectively process and interpret the measured variables to assess environmental quality. Despite challenges and limitations, such as data quality and interpretability of AI models, ongoing research and interdisciplinary collaboration are paving the way for the successful implementation of AI in environmental monitoring, ultimately supporting informed decision-making and sustainable resource management. While several review papers have explored the theory of artificial intelligence (AI), here I aim to review the application of ANNs and ML, in environmental aspects, specifically in automotive and industrial emissions toxicity measurements, as well as atmospheric pollution prevention. By examining the potential of AI in these domains, the paper contributes to understanding the role of advanced technologies in environmental monitoring and protection.",https://doi.org/10.20944/PREPRINTS202307.1298.V1,article

The review shows that the primary aims of using AI are to improve the service quality or to better understand traveller behaviour. Train and bus are the dominant modes of transport investigated. Furthermore, AI is mainly used for three tasks; the most frequent one is prediction, followed by an estimation of the current state, and resource allocation, including planning and scheduling.

The exact proportion and degree of infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals remains unclear. Studies however indicate that their management is crucial for control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Methodology We developed a simplified deterministic susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) mathematical model to assess the effect of active isolation of SARS-CoV-2 infected but asymptomatic individuals through blanket testing for control of the outbreak in Lusaka Province of Zambia. Here we modelled two scenarios; (1) assuming asymptomatic individuals comprised 70% of all COVID-19 cases and (2) asymptomatic individuals comprised only 50% of the cases. For contrast, the model was assessed first under the assumption that asymptomatic individuals are equally as infectious as symptomatic individuals and then secondly, and more likely, assuming asymptomatic individuals are only half as infectious as symptomatic individuals. Results For the model assuming 70% asymptomatic cases, a minimum sustained daily blanket testing rate of ≥ 7911 tests/100000 population was sufficient to control the outbreak if asymptomatic individuals are only half as infectious while if equal infectiousness was assumed then a testing rate of ≥ 10028 tests/ 100000 population would be required. For 50% asymptomatic, minimum blanket testing rates of ≥ 4540 tests/ 100000 population was sufficient to control the outbreak at both assumed levels of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals relative to symptomatic individuals.

The CAN model combines the cognitive variables perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, as well as the normative variable subjective (or social) norm, from the TAM models with the affective variables positive emotions, negative emotions and anxiety. The CAN model was tested on a sample of 600 randomly selected individuals through structural equation modeling. Data were obtained from a self-administered, online survey. The proposed model explains 73.92% of the intention to use the technological product in the very early stages of its adoption, that is, its early acceptance. Affective and normative factors have the greatest influence on the acceptance of a new technology; within the affective dimension, positive emotions have the greatest impact. Any technology acceptance model should thus consider the emotions that the new technology produces, as well as the influence of the social norm.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.CHB.2016.12.063,article

Pazmi{\~{n,2022.0,{Assessing the drivers of the regional digital divide and their impact on eGovernment services: evidence from a South American country,"Purpose: The paper explores the main drivers of the regional-level digital divide in Ecuadorian cities and the extent to which the information and communication technology (ICT) adoption by citizens influences local-level policymakers' decisions to develop eGovernment services. Design/methodology/approach: The paper used an exploratory approach. The authors empirically assessed the provision of eGovernment services in each of the 36 Ecuadorian local governments following the Local Online Service Index (LOSI) measurement scale proposed by the United Nations, and then evaluated the drivers of the eGovernment divide at a local level. Ordinary least squares regression analysis was used. Findings: The findings indicate that the digital divide is driven by income and education disparities, and that eGovernment availability is driven by ICT use. It appears that proper attention to technology use by its citizens is not being given by local-level policymakers in Ecuador when they devise their eGovernment strategy. Research limitations/implications: Because the data were available at different levels of aggregation, there may be some inaccuracy of the indicators and lack of generalizability. Researchers are encouraged to test this hypotheses with data at lower levels of aggregation and from different latitudes to provide a comparative view between countries. Practical implications: The paper includes implications for policymakers and local authorities regarding how the limitations on eGovernment development may be mitigated. Originality/value: This study fulfils the need to assess digital development and its impact on eGovernment services at a city level in a developing country.",https://doi.org/10.1108/ITP-09-2020-0628,article

"Vicente, Mar{\'{i",2011.0,{Assessing the regional digital divide across the European Union-27,"Despite the efforts devoted to the analysis of the digital divide over the last years, the regional evidence on this issue is still scarce. Within this context, the goals of this paper are twofold: (1) measuring the digital divide across the regions of the 27 Member States and within each country and (2) explaining the observed regional disparities. The analysis leads to identify Dutch regions as the Top-10 in ICT, while Greece and Bulgaria occupy the Bottom-10. Therefore, results show that the regional digital divide reflects to some extent the income gap. However, regional policy seems to be having some positive implications for technology adoption. In particular, the rural-versus-urban dimension of the digital gap appears to be less important than it is usually claimed to. Likewise, some evidence is found of the role of cultural and institutional factors in ICT adoption, an issue that has not been previously analyzed at the regional level. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.TELPOL.2010.12.013,article

To date, tsunami hazard studies have concentrated on determining the frequency and magnitude of events and in the production of simplistic flood maps. In general, such maps appear to have assumed a uniform vulnerability of population, infrastructure and business. In reality however, a complex set of factors interact to produce a pattern of vulnerability that varies spatially and temporally. A new vulnerability assessment approach is described, that incorporates multiple factors (e.g. parameters relating to the natural and built environments and socio-demographics) that contribute to tsunami vulnerability. The new methodology is applied on a coastal segment in Greece and, in particular, in Crete, west of the city of Herakleio. The results are presented within a Geographic Information System (GIS). The application of GIS ensures the approach is novel for tsunami studies, since it permits interrogation of the primary database by several different end-users. For example, the GIS may be used: (1) to determine immediate post-tsunami disaster response needs by the emergency services; (2) to pre-plan tsunami mitigation measures by disaster planners; (3) as a tool for local planning by the municipal authorities or; (4) as a basis for catastrophe modelling by insurance companies. We show that population density varies markedly with the time of the year and that 30% of buildings within the inundation zone are only single story thus increasing the vulnerability of their occupants. Within the high inundation depth zone, 11% of buildings are identified as in need of reinforcement and this figure rises to 50% within the medium inundation depth zone. 10% of businesses are located within the high inundation depth zone and these may need to consider their level of insurance cover to protect against primary building damage, contents loss and business interruption losses. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.5194/NHESS-3-377-2003,article

To increase the resilience of Chinese rural areas against external dangers, REMC and its driving elements must be effectively categorized and evaluated. This study examines the variations in REMC levels and driving factors across different cities and regions, revealing the spatial distribution patterns and underlying mechanisms. To improve REMC in Chinese rural areas, this research employs the Projection Pursuit Method to assess REMC in 280 cities from 2006 to 2020. Additionally, we identify 22 driving factors and use the Random Forest algorithm from machine learning to analyze their impact on REMC. The analysis is conducted at both national and city levels to compare the influence of various driving factors in different regions. The findings show that China's REMC levels have improved over time, driven by economic growth and the formation of urban clusters. Notably, some underdeveloped regions demonstrate higher REMC levels than more developed areas. The four most significant driving factors identified are rural road density, rural Internet penetration, per capita investment in fixed assets, and the density of township health centers. At the city level, rural Internet penetration and the e-commerce turnover of agricultural products have particularly strong driving effects. Moreover, the importance of driving factors varies across regions due to local conditions. This study offers valuable insights for the Chinese government to enhance REMC through region-specific strategies tailored to local circumstances.",https://doi.org/10.3390/SU17031001,article

Based on the municipal infrastructure data of the prefecture-level cities in China, municipal infrastructure development is assessed comprehensively using a FA (factor analysis) model, and then the stochastic model STIRPAT (stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence and technology) is examined to investigate key factors that influence municipal infrastructure of cities in various stages of urbanization and economy. This study indicates that the municipal infrastructure development in urban China demonstrates typical characteristics of regional differentiation, in line with the economic development pattern. Municipal infrastructure development in cities is primarily influenced by income, industrialization and investment. For China and similar developing countries under transformation, national public investment remains the primary driving force of economy as well as the key influencing factor of municipal infrastructure. Contribution from urbanization and the relative consumption level, and the tertiary industry is still scanty, which is a crux issue for many developing countries under transformation. With economic growth and the transformation requirements, the influence of the conventional factors such as public investment and industrialization on municipal infrastructure development would be expected to decline, meanwhile, other factors like the consumption and tertiary industry driven model and the innovation society can become key contributors to municipal infrastructure sustainability.",https://doi.org/10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0181917,article

Urbanization is an inevitable requirement for promoting social progress. The Chinese government sees sustainable urbanization as an engine of modernization and economic growth. And the country's urbanization has followed a unique course and is perhaps the greatest human-resettlement experiment in the world history, unprecedentedly transforming the Chinese society in a very short period of time. Yet problems have arisen during the historical process, China's unique path to urbanization has avoided many of pitfalls existing in the developing countries in Africa, Asia and South America. This paper attempts to conclude the good jobs as well as problems in China's urbanizing process which might provide successful experience for the underdeveloped nations and regions to promote urbanization. The most brilliant achievement of urbanization in China is that thousands of years' agriculture-dominated country has ended and a new urbanized country has formed, which only consumed several decades. The country's urban infrastructure, living conditions and public service for urban residents have made great improvements. The fostering urban agglomerations are considered to lead the country's socio-economic transformation and possess the greatest potential for the urbanization and economic growth in the coming decades. In general, the traditional land-centered urbanization in China is a typical “incomplete urbanization” and “low-quality urbanization”, presenting impressive characteristics of “four highs and five lows”—high investment, consumption, emission and expansion, and low level, quality, harmony degree, inclusiveness and sustainability. Undoubtedly, the traditional urbanization of China is increasingly difficult to continue and the transformation process should be speeded up as soon as possible.

This paper examines to what extent the new paradigm of 'data commons' will remain and even be reinforced, given the ongoing local elections and the volatile political and regional context of the upcoming May 2019 elections. In doing so, this paper elaborates on the steps Barcelona has been taking, given the new 'Declaration of Cities Coalition for Digital Rights' signed by Barcelona, Amsterdam, and New York. Nonetheless, as a result and continuation of previous published fieldwork research, by applying the Penta Helix framework from a social innovation perspective, this paper questions why several implementations are being consolidated while others actually show a tension between two different models: 'platform capitalism' vs 'platform co-operativism'. In regard to the former model, permanent strikes provoked by the Elite Taxi BCN association in August 2018 in response to the aftermath of big tech companies Cabify and Uber initially cleared to operate in Barcelona by the regional government, have demonstrated the negative side-effects of 'platform capitalism'. By contrast, Som Energia is a successful case study based on the latter innovative business model, 'platform co-operativism', stemming from grassroots-led urban experimentation.

She has done extensive fieldwork in India and South Africa, among others on challenges to point of care testing across different settings, diseases and actor groups. Abstract: Point of care (POC) testing in communities, home settings and primary healthcare centers are believed to have tremendous potential in reducing delays in diagnosing and initiating treatment for diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, syphilis and malaria. Quick diagnosis and further management decisions completed in the same clinical encounter or at least the same day, while the patient waits, promise to overcome delays associated with conventional laboratory-based testing. However, the availability of cheap, simple and rapid tests that can be conducted outside laboratories does not automatically ensure successful POC testing. In order to understand the new roles and challenges medical devices such as these encounter, we need to study how tests are used at the POC and integrated into workflow and patient pathways. This chapter reviews selected results from a qualitative research project on barriers to point of care testing in India and South Africa and discusses them comparatively. The project used semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions to examine diagnostic practices across major diseases and actors in homes, clinics, communities, hospitals and laboratories in South Africa and India. In comparing selected results, it becomes clear that both countries have very different diagnostic eco-systems that provide very different conditions for POC testing.

While there is a growing use of e-participation in the planning systems of developed countries, its application in developing countries has remained very limited. This paper explores the barriers to employing e-participation in the context of a developing country's planning system, using Iran as a case study. We have conducted interviews with different planning actors, including both public- and private-sector planners, to investigate what they perceive as such barriers. The results of this study show that the primary barriers to e-participation in Iran are attitudes towards participation, the structure and culture of the planning system, and staff capacity to engage the public through e-participation. The paper concludes with a series of recommendations regarding how these barriers can be overcome.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.CITIES.2021.103281,article

Members of the research team independently reviewed the literature (n = 108 articles) and used thematic analysis to find, examine, interpret, and report repeated patterns. Five main interconnected themes emerged with high inter-rater reliability throughout the analysis, which were: 1) the process is confusing and difficult to navigate; 2) exclusion from or lack of access to political power and recovery decision-making processes; 3) exclusion due to discrimination in its many forms; 4) issues in the funding aid ecosystem; and 5) politicians and media having an inordinate amount of control over the flow of resources and recovery processes. Findings point to a need for greater inclusion of historically marginalized populations throughout the pre-disaster planning and recovery process.

However, what ‘citizen-centric' means in practice is rarely articulated. We draw on and extend Sherry Arnstein's seminal work on participation in planning and renewal programmes to create the ‘Scaffold of Smart Citizen Participation'—a conceptual tool to unpack the diverse ways in which the smart city frames citizens. We use this scaffold to measure smart citizen inclusion, participation, and empowerment in smart city initiatives in Dublin, Ireland. Our analysis illustrates how most ‘citizen-centric' smart city initiatives are rooted in stewardship, civic paternalism, and a neoliberal conception of citizenship that prioritizes consumption choice and individual autonomy within a framework of state and corporate defined constraints that prioritize market-led solutions to urban issues, rather than being grounded in civil, social and political rights and the common good. We conclude that significant normative work is required to rethink ‘smart citizens' and ‘smart citizenship' and to remake smart cities if they are to truly become ‘citizen-centric'.",https://doi.org/10.1007/S10708-018-9845-8,article

Asserting that human rights can provide such compass, this paper first examines what a human rights-based approach to AI governance entails, and sets out the promise it propagates. Subsequently, it examines the pitfalls associated with human rights, particularly focusing on the criticism that these rights may be too Western, too individualistic, too narrow in scope and too abstract to form the basis of sound AI governance. After rebutting these reproaches, a plea is made to move beyond the calls for a human rights-based approach, and start taking the necessary steps to attain its realisation. It is argued that, without elucidating the applicability and enforceability of human rights in the context of AI; adopting legal rules that concretise those rights where appropriate; enhancing existing enforcement mechanisms and securing an underlying societal infrastructure that enables human rights in the first place, any human rights-based governance framework for AI risks falling short of its purpose.",https://doi.org/10.1007/S13347-020-00403-W,article

The objective is to monitor the integrity of the structures (e.g., buildings, bridges) and detect and pinpoint the locations of possible events (e.g., damages, cracks). Regarding today's complex structures, collecting data using wireless sensor data over extensive vertical lengths creates enormous challenges. With a direct BS deployment, a big amount of data will accumulate to be relayed to the BS.

In this article, we propose BigReduce, a cloud based health monitoring application with an IoT framework that could cover most of the key infrastructures of a smart city under an umbrella and provide event monitoring. To reduce the burden of big data processing at the BS and enhance the quality of event detection, we integrate real-time data processing and intelligent decision making capabilities with BigReduce. Particularly, we provide two innovative schemes for health event monitoring so that an IoT sensor can use them locally; one is a big data reduction scheme, and the other is a decision making scheme.

However, the question remains as to how cities can become “smart”. The application of information technology is generally considered a key driver in the “smartization” of cities. Detailed frameworks and procedures are therefore needed to guide, operationalize, and measure the implementation process as well as the impact of the respective technologies. In this paper, we discuss blockchain technology, a novel driver of technological transformation that comprises a multitude of underlying technologies and protocols, and its potential impact on smart cities. We specifically address the question of how blockchain technology may benefit the development of urban areas. Based on a comprehensive literature review, we present a framework and research propositions. We identify nine application fields of blockchain technology in the smartization of cities: (1) healthcare, (2) logistics and supply chains, (3) mobility, (4) energy, (5) administration and services, (6) e-voting, (7) factory, (8) home and (9) education.

Findsen & M. Formosa (2011). This 'handbook' operationalizes the theoretical approaches to lifelong learning as seen through the eyes of a senior adult. This book is a must read for those who have returned to both learning and formal education in later life. The handbook, structured into three sections includes the necessary background to understand aging adult learning, the philosophical, sociological, and psychological problems that older adults face daily, why older adults participate, and how they cope with learning. Each section is represented by practical chapters that allow the reader to decide what to take away while not passing judgment on the multinational policies that are currently in place. One interesting note is that the chapters do not have to be read in sequence, for this handbook contains pseudo-isolated chapters that stand on their own merit. It is easy to read ahead, as the introduction gives the reader a brief preview of what to expect. It is also easy to return to previous items of interest and tie them to adult education principles. All but the first chapter present a coda that provides the reader with a brief. This book is not a how-to manual but a fresh outlook that enlightens the reader on what is happening with learning for the older population.

A reflection on Beijing's Shuangjing International Sustainable Development Community Pilot,"The relation between planning and smart city development is interwoven. On the one hand, planning is being digitalized and ‘smartificated', but threatened by the growing dominance of IT corporations in urban development. On the other hand, bottom-up smart initiatives at the neighbourhood level are emerging to challenge top-down control, but the relation between top-down and bottom-up approaches is conflicting and often disconnected. In the Chinese context, a newly established neighbourhood planning mechanism–community duty planners (CDPs)–appears to open up opportunities for bridging bottom-up and top-down approaches to smart city development. In Beijing, the CDPs are institutionalized under Beijing's Refined Urban Management (RUM) framework which aims to improve the city's built environment and quality of living. The CDPs play the role of intermediary actors connecting local government with the communities. The article is a reflection on the Shuangjing International Sustainable Development Community Pilot and the CDPs of Shuangjing Neighbourhood. It describes and reflects on how planning institutions can influence smart city development at the neighbourhood level and how bottom-up initiatives can be connected to long-term top-down plans. Highlights An institutional planning arrangement placing planners as intermediary actors at the neighbourhood level can help to resolve the conflicts between short-term and long-term objectives in smart city development. Besides planners, an intermediary role can be fulfilled by groups or individuals who have mastery of IT and a good grasp of urban knowledge. Future community planning education is suggested to incorporate more IT-related components.

Varr{\'{o,2020.0,{Bringing back the national to the study of globally circulating policy ideas: ‘Actually existing smart urbanism' in Hungary and the Netherlands,"Recently proliferating ‘smart city' building efforts have lent themselves well to interpretations through the lens of the policy mobilities literature. Applying this perspective, studies have insightfully shown how policymaking centred around smart cities is at once a messy, networked process stretching across scales, while also manifesting itself in concrete practices shaped by territorial–regulatory contexts. Informed by empirical research on smart city policies in Hungary and the Netherlands, this paper argues that the policy mobilities approach tends to overemphasize the global and the local. Notwithstanding the transnational circulation of smart city ideas, the national scale continues being reproduced by these ideas as a relevant scale of urban regulation, discursive framing and strategy-making under globalization. To acknowledge this, and to move towards a more decidedly multiscalar perspective on actually existing smart urbanisms, it is suggested that we incorporate the national scale, understood as a relational set of practices and discourses, more explicitly into our analysis. Insights from the Hungarian and Dutch case studies are used to illustrate the manifold ways in which the local embedding of the globally mobile smart city concept is shaped by the national scale, as well as how the national itself is being renegotiated in this process.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0969776419893731,article

Advantages of applying usability methods to eGovernment include recognising barriers to use, identifying future development priorities and using already existing methods to assess and compare online offerings. Importantly, the inclusion of and focus on real users also fits with the wider government ideals of greater public participation and strengthening democracy.To highlight the potential of such an approach, we present a case study. Usability methods, such as presented here in a user survey, can develop new insights by expressly targeting different user groups and through open-ended questions.

Despite the widespread digital adoption in Singapore, older adults, especially those of lower socioeconomic status (SES), still face difficulties in adopting information and communications technology and are typically digitally excluded. Objective: We aimed to examine the impact of the volunteer-led, one-on-one, and home-based digital literacy program on digital literacy and health-related outcomes such as self-reported loneliness, social connectedness, quality of life, and well-being for older adults of low SES. Methods: A nonrandomized controlled study was carried out in Singapore between July 2020 and November 2021 involving 138 digitally excluded community-dwelling older adults aged ≥55 years and of lower SES. Older adults awaiting participation in the program served as controls. Older adults under the intervention were equipped with a smartphone and cellular data, underwent fortnightly to monthly digital literacy training with volunteers to learn digital skills, and digitally connected to their existing social networks. Primary outcome was the improvement in self-reported digital literacy. Secondary outcomes included improvements in University of California, Los Angeles 3-item loneliness scale, Lubben Social Network Scale-6, EQ-5D-3L and EQ visual analogue scale scores, and Personal Wellbeing Score. Results: There were significant improvements in digital literacy scores in the intervention group as compared to controls (mean difference 2.28, 95% CI 1.37-3.20; P < .001). Through multiple linear regression analyses, this difference in digital literacy scores remained independently associated with group membership after adjusting for differences in baseline scores, age, gender, education, living arrangement, housing type, and baseline social connectivity and loneliness status. There was no statistically significant difference in University of California, Los Angeles 3-item loneliness scale, Lubben Social Network Scale-6, Personal Wellbeing Score, or EQ-5D Utility and visual analogue scale score. Conclusions: This study adds to the growing research on digital inclusion by showing that a volunteer-led, one-on-one, and home-based digital literacy program contributed to increase digital literacy in older adults of low SES.

The ability to connect and monitor data from sensor networks remotely in real time as well as the simulation and optimization of engineering systems, have led to the emergence of the Digital Twin (DT) concept of the structured environment. Although BIM lacks semantic completeness in areas beyond the scope of building modelling such as control systems, cadastral systems, networking of sensors, meteorological networks, etc., the DTs aim to achieve the synchronization of big data from various sources and simulate the real world into a virtual platform for the seamless management and control of the construction process, facility management, environmental monitoring, disaster management and disaster prevention, and other life cycle processes within the built environment. DTs in the built environment are still in nascent stages and thus a more in-depth investigation is required to explore and establish the best practices and technologies to serve this evolution.

Materials and Methods: We created an evaluation framework with 100 benchmark questions and ideal responses, and five guideline questions for chatbot responses. This framework, validated by mental health experts, was tested on a GPT-3.5-turbo-based chatbot. Automated evaluation methods explored included large language model (LLM)-based scoring, an agentic approach using real-time data, and embedding models to compare chatbot responses against ground truth standards. Results: The results highlight the importance of guidelines and ground truth for improving LLM evaluation accuracy. The agentic method, dynamically accessing reliable information, demonstrated the best alignment with human assessments. Adherence to a standardized, expert-validated framework significantly enhanced chatbot response safety and reliability. Discussion: Our findings emphasize the need for comprehensive, expert-tailored safety evaluation metrics for mental health chatbots.

These living laboratories are often assumed to function through ‘quadruple helix' relations between varied actors from the public, private, university and community sectors. However, empirical research that explores the real-world functioning of these arrangements is comparatively limited. This paper will help address this gap through the case of Newcastle City Futures (NCF) – a university-anchored platform for collaborative urban foresight research, public engagement and innovation. In particular, the paper will concentrate on a two-year period when NCF focused on the facilitation of innovation demonstrator projects guided by the vision of Newcastle upon Tyne developing a postindustrial future as a ‘test-bed city'. Detailed empirical accounts of the development of two demonstrator projects are used to illustrate and analyse processes of cross-sectoral collaboration and engaging the public in co-design. These are used to support the conceptual argument that the presence of the quadruple helix as a form of local innovation system should not be taken as given.

A sample of 80 bus operators were randomly assigned to the low (n = 40) and high demands (n = 40) conditions. Demands were manipulated by increasing or reducing the number of stops to pick up passengers, and decision latitude by imposing or removing restrictions on the Rapid Transit Bus (BRT) operators' pace of work. Outcome variables include physiological markers (heart rate [HR], heart rate variability [HRV], breathing rate [BR], electromyography [EMG], and skin conductance [SC]), objective driving performance and self-report measurements of psychological wellbeing (psychological distress, interest/enjoyment [I/E], perceived competence, effort/importance [E/I], and pressure/tension [P/T]). It was found that job decision latitude moderates the effect of job demands on both physiological arousal (BR: F(1, 74) = 4.680, p = .034, SC: F(1, 75) = 6.769, p = .011, and EMG: F(1, 75) = 6.550, p = .013) and psychological well-being (P/T: F(1, 75) = 4.289, p = .042 and I/E: F(1, 74) = 4.548, p = .036). Consistently with the JDC model buffering hypothesis, the experimental findings suggest that increasing job decision latitude can moderate the negative effect of job demands on different psychophysiological outcomes. This finding is useful for designing organizational and clinical interventions in an occupational group at high risk of work stress-related disease.",https://doi.org/10.1037/OCP0000040,article

However, none of the studies have examined how alignment with relevant sustainable development goals (SDGs) and leveraging technological innovations such as digital marketing can enhance the contribution of university business incubators and entrepreneurial training imparted at HEIs to encourage sustainable entrepreneurship. Since the entire world is focused on systematically pursuing SDGs to achieve the 2030 agenda envisioned by the United Nations, the present study posited that incubators and entrepreneurial training at HEI, which are aligned with pertinent SDGs and the latest technological innovations, would be more relevant in grooming future entrepreneurs skilled to contribute to the sustainability agenda. Thereby, it examined the key aspects of the entrepreneurship-SDGs-technology union in the higher education setting. Toward this end, open-ended essays were used to collect data from 38 start-up owners/partners/employees who have been associated with university business incubators recently or received entrepreneurial training at HEIs in the recent past. Content analysis of the qualitative data revealed the extent to which the existing incubators and entrepreneurial training at HEIs were aligned with SDGs 4, 9, 11, and 12.

One explanation for this oversight is that limited information flow and cognitive bias limit their ability to recognize and develop CE opportunities. We propose a framework for a CE-focused incubator that removes these barriers to circular economy entrepreneurship. The framework defines how multiple stakeholders interact in order to provide critical information for CE development. Stakeholders include firms seeking economical ways to handle waste, firms that might use waste as value-added input, government agencies, and circular economy analysts that can provide potentially beneficial information, e.g. via Material Flow Analysis. Entrepreneurs would be recruited to develop CE ventures. The government would be asked to support initial financing, but the final start-ups would stand on their own as enterprises worthy of venture capital funding. The collaborative environment would promote profitable CE behavior. CE entrepreneurs need access to relevant information and a supportive network, both of which the CE-focused incubator we propose provides.

This paper aims to address the question of whether cities can become smart without actually being sustainable. The study undertakes a systematic review of the smart and sustainable cities literature. The analysis highlights an expectation in the reviewed academic literature for cities to become sustainable first in order to be considered truly smart. The results point to major challenges of smart cities in delivering sustainable outcomes: (a) Smart city policies are characterised by heavy technocentricity; (b) Smart city practices involve complexities, and; (c) Smart city notions are conceptualised in an ad-hoc manner. The findings provide evidence that the current smart city practice fails to incorporate an overarching sustainability goal that is progressive and genuine.

Our findings show that: (1) Smart city construction pilot significantly improves GTFP and green technological progress (GTP) in China, but its influence on GTE is not significant, which means smart city construction promotes GTFP mainly through promoting GTP. This conclusion is still valid after a series of robustness tests. (2) The estimation result of mediating effect models is that smart city construction promoted GTFP and GTP mainly through boosting urban technological innovation.

Data gathered from user and industry interviews, conducted during a field study in Tanzania between March-May 2009 is together with literature from Kenya used to compare the m-banking environment in the two countries. M-PESA is provided by mobile network operators (MNOs), Safaricom in Kenya and Vodacom in Tanzania. Both are the leading MNO in their respective country although Vodacom has a substantially lower market share and turnover compared to Safaricom. This simple fact resonates in many areas affecting M-PESA, such as: size of marketing budget, M-PESA's priority within the organization and the company's ability to quickly sign up agents and attract initial customers. Differences in the general economic situation, the geography and political history are also put forward. Kenya has a stronger economy, a higher GDP and a more developed banking system. This has contributed to the financial literacy in the country which is an important factor when communicating a service like M-PESA. Among the differences between the two implementations, we suggest that the three most influential factors to the user uptake have been the two companies ability to transform their airtime distribution into an agent network, the marketing strategy which needed to be adopted to the specific settings in each country, and the geographical and demographic conditions.",http://www.valuablebits.com,article

The general objective of this qualitative study was to explore how digital literacy skills can advance the lives of people currently searching for employment. Data were obtained using semi-structured interviews with participants who were not employed and with diverse school backgrounds. The results indicate a need to strengthen existing digital literacy programmes for NEET people. Most of the interviewed NEET people experienced challenges when seeking work on digital platforms, because they are not skilled in digital literacy. Analysis of the data from interview transcripts revealed that there is an array of challenges which prevent NEET people from efficiently using ICTs when searching for work opportunities. These include the high cost of Internet connections and the lack of knowledge of how to use these digital platforms. The study concludes that digital literacy is one of the skills which remains critical for work seekers to increase their chances of achieving continuous work opportunities, and eventually obtain employment or become employers themselves.

Five attributes: the average travel speed of the traffic, vehicles density, roads width, road traffic signals and the roads' length are utilized by the proposed approach to find the optimal paths. The average travel speed and vehicles density values can be obtained from the sensors deployed in smart cities and communicated to vehicles and roadside communication units via vehicular ad hoc networks.

Local stakeholders, including entrepreneurs, non-profits, academics and government agencies, are interviewed and the results are analyzed via axial coding to extract trends in attitudes and perceptions. Two principal results emerge from the analysis: First, while government involvement was viewed as part of the process, stakeholders do not trust the government to lead the development. Second, many stakeholders do not fully understand circular-economy strategies and opportunities, emphasizing traditional waste management approaches such as recycling over value-added conversion of waste. Different stakeholders demonstrate different knowledge gaps, e.g. entrepreneurs tend not to recognize the financial case for circular economy, a prerequisite to their motivation to participate in incubation. These results suggest that circular-economy incubators would help entrepreneurs find and pursue circular-economy opportunities with a limited role for government. Also, education about circular-economy approaches is needed to motivate and inform participation in a circular-economy incubator.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.JCLEPRO.2021.126412,article

With significant numbers of actors and stakeholders involved in the reconstruction process, no significant relief has reached the ground or is observable even after 3 years of the disaster. The government has formed National Reconstruction Authority (NRA) as the focal authority for the reconstruction process which is leading the reconstruction process with line agencies and other stakeholders.

These procedures achieved an average accuracy of 73% and determined the main factors related to the practical use of e-Government in each of the countries, e.g. the frequency of buying goods over the Internet or the education level. In addition, we compared the proposed indexes to other indexes measuring the level of e-readiness of a country such as the E-Government Development Index (EGDI) its Online Service Index (OSI) component, the Networked Readiness Index (NRI) and its Government usage component (GU).

Methods: Prospective data from the Finnish Public Sector Study. Repeated exposure to low job control, high job demands, low effort, low rewards and compositions of these ( job strain and effort-reward imbalance) were assessed at Time 1 (2000-2002) and Time 2 (2004). Insufficient physical activity (<14 metabolic equivalent task hours per week) was measured at Time 1 and Time 3 (2008). The effect of change in workplace stressors on change in physical activity was examined using fixedeffects (within-subject) logistic regression models (N=6665). In addition, logistic regression analysis was applied to examine the associations between repeated exposure to workplace stressors and insufficient physical activity (N=13 976).

Have foresight practitioners understood cities complexity? Have urban planners used adequate tools to generate plausible future visions? Are city policy makers using foresight studies to limit urban uncertainty? Design/methodology/approach: In total, 20 city foresight examples were selected which either have international relevance or which constitute good examples of future-oriented initiatives. Case studies were classified into five taxonomies: European Union initiatives; local initiatives; academic initiatives; corporate initiatives; and architectural initiatives. A set of assessment criteria was established: city complexity conceptualization; methodological approach; and study impact. Findings: Preliminary research outcomes show growing doubts about the appropriateness of the foresight tools used in cities and about the competency of foresight practitioners in understanding the complex and dynamic nature of contemporary cities. Furthermore, policy makers do not seem to grasp the potential of foresight to formulate urban strategies. Research limitations/implications: Some of the initiatives studied are relatively recent, so impact analysis has been limited by available data. Mostly, secondary documented sources were used to validate cases' assessment. Research suggests a number of areas in which foresight studies may have a practical application to the urban realm.

"Ju, Jingrui and Liu, Luning and Feng, Yuqiang",2018.0,{Citizen-centered big data analysis-driven governance intelligence framework for smart cities,"Sensors and systems within rapidly expanding smart cities produce citizen-centered big data which have potential value to support citizen-centered urban governance decision-making. There exists a wealth of extant conceptual studies, however, further operational studies are needed to establish a specific path towards implementation of such data to governance decision-making with analytical algorithms that are appropriate for each step of the path. This paper proposes a framework for the use of citizen-centered big data analysis to drive governance intelligence in smart cities from two perspectives: urban governance issues and data-analysis algorithms. The framework consists of three layers: 1) A data-merging layer, which builds a citizen-centered panoramic data set for each citizen by merging citizen-related big data from multiple sources in collaborative urban governance via similarity calculation and conflict resolution; 2) a knowledge-discovery layer, which plots the citizen profile and citizen persona at both individual and group levels in terms of urban public service delivery and citizen participation via simple statistical analysis techniques, machine learning, and econometrics methods; and 3) a decision-making layer, which uses ontology models to standardize urban governance-related attributes, personas, and associations to support governance decision-making via data mining and Bayesian Net techniques. Finally, the proposed framework is validated in a case study on blood donation governance in China. This research highlights the value of citizen-centered big data, pushes data-to-decision research from conceptual to operational, synthesizes previously published frameworks for citizen-centered big data analysis in smart cities, and enhances the mutual supplement cross multiple disciplinaries.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.TELPOL.2018.01.003,article

The remainder of the chapter provides an initial framing for engaging with these questions. The first section details the dominant neoliberal conception and enactment of smart cities and how this works to promote the interests of capital and state power and reshape governmentality. We then detail some of the more troubling ethical issues associated with smart city technologies and initiatives. Having set out some of the more troubling aspects of how social relations are produced within smart cities, we then examine how citizens and citizenship have been conceived and operationalized in the smart city to date. We then follow this with a discussion of social justice and the smart city. In the fifth section, we explore the notion of the “right to the smart city” and how this might be used to recast the smart city in emancipatory and empowering ways.

In this, the first paper, we identify eight integrated regional and local interventions that, when combined, encourage walking, cycling, and public transport use, while reducing private motor vehicle use. These interventions are destination accessibility, equitable distribution of employment across cities, managing demand by reducing the availability and increasing the cost of parking, designing pedestrian-friendly and cycling-friendly movement networks, achieving optimum levels of residential density, reducing distance to public transport, and enhancing the desirability of active travel modes (eg, creating safe attractive neighbourhoods and safe, affordable, and convenient public transport). Together, these interventions will create healthier and more sustainable compact cities that reduce the environmental, social, and behavioural risk factors that affect lifestyle choices, levels of traffic, environmental pollution, noise, and crime. The health sector, including health ministers, must lead in advocating for integrated multisector city planning that prioritises health, sustainability, and liveability outcomes, particularly in rapidly changing low-income and middle-income countries.

Nevertheless, policy makers, city planners, and practitioners appear to have quite different expectations from what smart cities can offer them. This has led to the emergence of different types of smart cities and pathways of development. This paper aims to answer the research question: When comparing a selection of smart city projects, can we classify pathways for their implementation? We do this by using a cross-case research design of four cities to explore commonalities and differences in development patterns. An input-output (IO) model of smart city development is used to retrieve which design variables are at play and lead to which output. The four cases pertain to the following smart city projects: Smart Dubai, Masdar City, Barcelona Smart City, and Amsterdam Smart City. Our analysis shows that Amsterdam is based on a business-driven approach that puts innovation at its core; for Masdar, technological optimism is the main essence of the pathway; social inclusion is the focus of Barcelona Smart City; and visionary ambitious leadership is the main driver for Smart Dubai. Based on these insights, a classification for smart city development pathways is established.

We aimed to identify risk factors and strategies in the approach to mental health assessment and to prevention and treatment of common mental health problems for immigrants in primary care. Methods: We searched and compiled literature on prevalence and risk factors for common mental health problems related to migration, the effect of cultural influences on health and illness, and clinical strategies to improve mental health care for immigrants and refugees. Publications were selected on the basis of relevance, use of recent data and quality in consultation with experts in immigrant and refugee mental health. Results: The migration trajectory can be divided into three components: premigration, migration and postmigration resettlement. Each phase is associated with specific risks and exposures. The prevalence of specific types of mental health problems is influenced by the nature of the migration experience, in terms of adversity experienced before, during and after resettlement. Specific challenges in migrant mental health include communication difficulties because of language and cultural differences; the effect of cultural shaping of symptoms and illness behaviour on diagnosis, coping and treatment; differences in family structure and process affecting adaptation, acculturation and intergenerational conflict; and aspects of acceptance by the receiving society that affect employment, social status and integration. These issues can be addressed through specific inquiry, the use of trained interpreters and culture brokers, meetings with families, and consultation with community organizations. Interpretation: Systematic inquiry into patients' migration trajectory and subsequent follow-up on culturally appropriate indicators of social, vocational and family functioning over time will allow clinicians to recognize problems in adaptation and undertake mental health promotion, disease prevention or treatment interventions in a timely way. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1503/CMAJ.090292,article

A research-based and tested eLearning model was used to design and evaluate an online M.Ed. course in order to study factors that influence the quality of an eLearning event. Several data collection methods were used to explore the experiences of key stakeholders in this case study: learners, design team, and instructors. This study reveals that learners engaged in a level of community that best suited their needs. Striving to achieve a spirit of community seemed to yield beneficial learning outcomes. This study also explored the tension between structure and flexibility in course design. While skillful planning and extensive organization help create a positive learning environment, the design must also be conducive to rapid re-design as the course progresses in order to respond to learning needs as they emerge. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.IHEDUC.2005.06.004,article
"Bateman, Daniel Robert and Brady, Erin and Wilkerson, David and Yi, Eun Hye and Karanam, Yamini and Callahan, Christopher M.",2017.0,{Comparing crowdsourcing and friendsourcing: A social media-based feasibility study to support Alzheimer disease caregivers,"Background: In the United States, over 15 million informal caregivers provide unpaid care to people with Alzheimer disease (AD). Compared with others in their age group, AD caregivers have higher rates of stress, and medical and psychiatric illnesses. Psychosocial interventions improve the health of caregivers. However, constraints of time, distance, and availability inhibit the use of these services. Newer online technologies, such as social media, online groups, friendsourcing, and crowdsourcing, present alternative methods of delivering support. However, limited work has been done in this area with caregivers. Objective: The primary aims of this study were to determine (1) the feasibility of innovating peer support group work delivered through social media with friendsourcing, (2) whether the intervention provides an acceptable method for AD caregivers to obtain support, and (3) whether caregiver outcomes were affected by the intervention. A Facebook app provided support to AD caregivers through collecting friendsourced answers to caregiver questions from participants' social networks. The study's secondary aim was to descriptively compare friendsourced answers versus crowdsourced answers. Methods: We recruited AD caregivers online to participate in a 6-week-long asynchronous, online, closed group on Facebook, where caregivers received support through moderator prompts, group member interactions, and friendsourced answers to caregiver questions. We surveyed and interviewed participants before and after the online group to assess their needs, views on technology, and experience with the intervention. Caregiver questions were pushed automatically to the participants' Facebook News Feed, allowing participants' Facebook friends to see and post answers to the caregiver questions (Friendsourced answers). Of these caregiver questions, 2 were pushed to crowdsource workers through the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. We descriptively compared characteristics of these crowdsourced answers with the friendsourced answers. Results: In total, 6 AD caregivers completed the initial online survey and semistructured telephone interview. Of these, 4 AD caregivers agreed to participate in the online Facebook closed group activity portion of the study. Friendsourcing and crowdsourcing answers to caregiver questions had similar rates of acceptability as rated by content experts: 90% (27/30) and 100% (45/45), respectively. Rates of emotional support and informational support for both groups of answers appeared to trend with the type of support emphasized in the caregiver question (emotional vs informational support question). Friendsourced answers included more shared experiences (20/30, 67%) than did crowdsourced answers (4/45, 9%). Conclusions: We found an asynchronous, online, closed group on Facebook to be generally acceptable as a means to deliver support to caregivers of people with AD. This pilot is too small to make judgments on effectiveness; however, results trended toward an improvement in caregivers' self-efficacy, sense of support, and perceived stress, but these results were not statistically significant. Both friendsourced and crowdsourced answers may be an acceptable way to provide informational and emotional support to caregivers of people with AD.",https://doi.org/10.2196/RESPROT.6904,article

This paper focuses on the comparative study of the applicability of the epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model, the Reasenberg–Jones (R–J) model and the Omi–R–J model, which are widely adopted internationally for short-term aftershock forecasting and seismic hazard mitigation strategy research. We compare the stability of model parameters and aftershock occurrence rate forecasting, and evaluate the effectiveness of forecasting using the N-test and T-test with multiple time windows. The results show that the sequence parameters of the ETAS model, the R–J model and the Omi–R–J model tend to stabilize after 15.50, 15.50 and 6.00 days following the earthquake respectively, and the attenuation of the Wenchuan MS8.0 earthquake is rather normal. Compared to the ETAS model and the R–J model, the Omi–R–J model obtain steadier model parameters in a shorter time with significantly smaller parameters pORJ, cORJ, bORJ and standard deviations. Among the three models, the overall aftershock occurrence rate forecasted by the R–J model is the highest, followed by the Omi–R–J model, while that of the ETAS model is the lowest. N-test results show overall forecasting effectiveness of 93.8, 80.7 and 97.7% for the ETAS, R–J and Omi–R–J models, respectively, with the ETAS and Omi–R–J models superior to the R–J model, and the Omi–R–J model slightly better than the ETAS model. The overall “information gain per earthquake” calculation results show that the ETAS model is superior to the Omi–R–J and R–J models, while the Omi–R–J model is better than the R–J model; thus the combined use of the ETAS and Omi–R–J models by focusing on their respective strengths might ensure optimal performance. These “maneuverable” forecasting approaches to short-term aftershock model forecasting will play a vital role in efficient post-disaster relief, emergency management decision-making and post-disaster reconstruction.",https://doi.org/10.1007/S00024-019-02192-6,article

In this literature, universities are often discussed as an example of an institution with a particularly strong and cohesive logic, one rooted in notions of academic excellence and the pursuit of universal knowledge. However, more recent literature has argued that multiple institutional logics often compete and conflict with one another in a single organization. In this paper, we use the notion of competing logics to examine how academics in the United Kingdom understand the university as an institution. We perform a factor analysis on questionnaires completed by academics to identify overarching rationalizations of universities. Our analysis suggests three competing institutional logics characterize universities: autonomy, utilitarianism and managerialism.

However, this is just one level of the ongoing transformation. More broadly, digital technology is deeply woven into everyday practices, social interactions, cultural experiences, economic transactions, and political decision-making (Manovich 2013; Williamson 2014). This results in that digital literacy, understood mainly as a set of adequate skills that help in navigating digitalized everyday environments, needs to be accompanied by notions of broader critical awareness of technologies' role in society.

An exploratory survey analysis finds that the four citizenship perspectives are significantly related to political behavior, even when socioeconomic status and attitudinal variables related to participation are controlled.

Yet, a theoretical account for the effects of the digital divide is currently lacking. This study examines three levels of the digital divide. The digital access divide (the first-level digital divide) is the inequality of access to information technology (IT) in homes and schools. The digital capability divide (the second-level digital divide) is the inequality of the capability to exploit IT arising from the first-level digital divide and other contextual factors. The digital outcome divide (the third-level digital divide) is the inequality of outcomes (e.g., learning and productivity) of exploiting IT arising from the second-level digital divide and other contextual factors. Drawing on social cognitive theory and computer self-efficacy literature, we developed a model to show how the digital access divide affects the digital capability divide and the digital outcome divide among students. The digital access divide focuses on computer ownership and usage in homes and schools. The digital capability divide and the digital outcome divide focus on computer self-efficacy and learning outcomes, respectively. This model was tested using data collected from over 4,000 students in Singapore. The results generate insights into the relationships among the three levels of the digital divide and provide a theoretical account for the effects of the digital divide. While school computing environments help to increase computer self-efficacy for all students, these factors do not eliminate knowledge the gap between students with and without home computers.

In the intersection between these trends, urban experimentation has developed as a process where actors are granted action space to test innovations in a collaborative setting. One arena for urban experimentation is urban testbeds. Testbeds are sites of urban development, in which experimentation constitutes an integral part of planning and developing the area. This article introduces the notion of testbed planning as a way to conceptualize planning processes in delimited sites where planning is combined with processes of urban experimentation. We define testbed planning as a multi-actor, collaborative planning process in a delimited area, with the ambition to generate and disseminate learning while simultaneously developing the site. The aim of this article is to explore processes of testbed planning with regard to the role of urban planners. Using an institutional logics perspective we conceptualize planners as navigating between a public sector-and an experimental logic. The public sector logic constitutes the formal structure of “traditional” urban planning, and the experimental logic a collaborative and testing governance structure. Using examples from three Nordic municipalities, this article explores planning roles in experiments with autonomous buses in testbeds. The analysis shows that planners negotiate these logics in three different ways, combining and merging them, separating and moving between them or acting within a conflictual process where the public sector logic dominates.",https://doi.org/10.17645/UP.V5I1.2528,article

The researchers collected data from surveys and interviews given to educators at three public schools in the Machakos region of Kenya in summer 2023. Analysis of the data suggests there is a disconnect between the educators' perspectives on the importance of ICT and digital literacy and the lack of resources available to implement ICT and digital literacy training. Based on this analysis, the researchers plan to expand and diversify their data pool, adapt the digital literacy curriculum in collaboration with Kenya educators, and determine methods of collecting data that may reveal the long-term effects of digital literacy training on students. The researchers will take these measures to further the program's ultimate goal of positively impacting students and their communities by increasing digital literacy.",https://doi.org/10.1080/01930826.2025.2475708,article

While research on this topic has focused primarily on injuries, there are multiple mechanisms by which e-scooter share programs may impact health. The aim of this study is to explore the health-related behaviors of e-scooter users and to discuss their implications for public health. Data were collected using an online survey emailed to registered e-scooter users. A total of 1070 users completed the survey. Descriptive variable statistics and chi-squared analysis were performed to determine variable dependent relationships and equality of proportions. The most common destinations reported were “just riding around for fun”, home, and dining/shopping. The two most common modes of transportation that would have been used if e-scooters were not available were walking (43.5%) and using a personal vehicle (28.5%). Riding behavior was equally mixed between on the street, on the sidewalk, and equal amounts of both. e-Scooters in Provo are likely having both positive (e.g., air pollution) and negative impacts on health (e.g., injuries, physical inactivity). Future research should further explore patterns of e-scooter use and explicitly examine the linkages between e-scooters and areas of health beyond just injuries.",https://doi.org/10.3390/IJERPH17176344,article

Our findings suggest a recursive model of new logic construction in which council members mobilize three emotional facilitators (social emotions, moral emotions, and emotional energy) to affect three logic-construction cycles (agreeing on values, shared learning, and enacting shared values). Emotional facilitators work through three agentic mechanisms: enabling actors to become open and reflexive about their home logics and simultaneously increase their commitment to and engagement in constructing a shared governance logic. Ongoing interactions involving emotional facilitators, agentic mechanisms, and logicconstruction cycles are essential in sustaining the new logic. The processmodel foregrounds the role of emotions in enabling dually embedded agency, thereby extending extant theory that has tended to focus narrowly on cognitive dynamics. We discuss implications for our understanding of institutional agency, the role of emotions in new logic construction, and the role of microlevel interactions in the formation of macrolevel structures.",https://doi.org/10.5465/AMJ.2015.0402,article

However, existing research does not provide a clear picture of how this smart city agenda actually contributes to sustainability. The social science literature has been critical toward urban smartness, with most of the empirical research focusing on the politics of data-driven and entrepreneurial urbanism. This article seeks to contribute to this debate by empirically examining the role that sustainability plays in the smart city discourse. Its distinctive approach is to investigate how urban smartness and sustainability are framed by an authoritative institution (the European Union) and then to trace these framings down to a particular city (Stavanger, Norway). The data show that the smartness approach is strongly tied to innovation, technology, and economic entrepreneurialism, and sustainability does not appear to be a very important motivating driver.

This paper argues that it is feasible to employ a large number of mobile vehicles in smart city to construct a large-scale low-cost delivery infrastructure using opportunistic routing to improve the city's social welfare. To this end, a low-cost good delivery system (LCGDS) with opportunistic relay is proposed to meet the requirements of good delivery. In LCGDS, an enormous number of mobile vehicles constitute a stable, highly reliable, low-cost infrastructure with large transportation capabilities, called the mobile Internet of mission-critical things (M-IoMCT). The main contributions of the LCGDS are: 1) demonstrate the technological feasibility of M-IoMCT for delivering goods through mobile vehicles in a 'ride-sharing' fashion with low costs and 2) in order to increase the reliability of goods transmission, the LCGDS proposes mobile vehicle selection algorithm which effectively selects a vehicle with higher probability of arriving at the destination. Both theoretical and experimental simulation results show that the performance of the LCGDS outperforms those of other solutions. Compared with other solutions, our results demonstrate that the costs in the LCGDS are only about 24% of the costs in the origin goods transmission scheme.",https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2825250,article

While these critiques have been essential for understanding contemporary forms of techno-capitalism and their reach into new areas, this paper calls for a consideration of alternative modes of digital development in urban life beyond the logics of securitisation and capital accumulation. In particular, I examine the critical discourses and experimental practices of a grassroots movement focused on claiming “technological sovereignty” (TS) in Barcelona. The TS movement is a broad, de-centralised network of cooperatives, associations, and community initiatives experimenting with alternative practices of locally rooted, open-source digital development. These groups explore democratic and cooperative practices of work, property, production, and consumption in relation to digital technology, based around an ethics of care and a commitment to working through and within local communities.

The expectation-confirmation theory (ECT) is adapted with perceived enjoyment, habit and user involvement. Data was collected via an online survey. A total of 430 valid responses were collected. The research model was assessed by structural equation modelling (SEM). The results show that continuance intention of blog use was predicted collectively by user involvement, satisfaction and perceived enjoyment. Habit, however, exhibited no strong relationship with satisfaction and use intention. Users' satisfaction with blog use was predicted primarily by perceived enjoyment, followed by users' confirmation of expectation and user involvement. Perceived enjoyment was predicted by users' involvement and users' confirmation of expectation. Blogging time significantly moderates the effect of habit on perceived enjoyment, but not on satisfaction and continuance intention. The integrated model explains 65% of the satisfaction and 57% of continuance intention. The results suggest that integrating perceived enjoyment and user involvement into the ECT provides better insights into continuous use in the blog context. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1080/0144929X.2012.671851,article

However, no study has quantified the quality and quantity of turning during normal daily activities in older people. The objective of this pilot study was to determine if quality of turning during daily activities is associated with falls and/or cognitive function. Methods: Thirty-five elderly participants (85 ± 8 years) wore three Opal inertial sensors. Turning and activity rate were measured. Based on retrospective falls, participants were grouped into nonfallers (N = 16), single fallers (N = 12), and recurrent fallers (N = 7). We also determined which turning characteristic predicted falls in the 6 months following the week of monitoring. Results: Quality of turning was significantly compromised in recurrent fallers compared with nonfallers (p <. 05). In contrast, activity rate and mean number of turns per hour were similar across the three groups. Also, quality of turning during a prescribed test was similar across the three groups. Visuospatial and memory functions and the Tinetti Balance Scores were associated with quality of turning. Future falls were related to an increased variability of number of steps to turn. Conclusions: Continuous monitoring of turning characteristics, while walking during daily activities, is feasible in older people. Turning characteristics during daily life appear to be more sensitive to fall risk than prescribed turning tasks. These findings suggest a slower, less variable, cautious turning strategy in elderly volunteers with a history of falls.",https://doi.org/10.1093/GERONA/GLW019,article

E-participation platforms usually succeed and produce positive effects in the community when adopted in the long-term scenario. The adoption of those platforms is still a challenge for local governments. The understanding of the factors that influence the continuous intention to use e-participation over time is critical for the design of diffusion and promotion strategies that motivate the citizens to keep using e-participation. This article explores the drivers that predict the post-adoption of e-participation platforms from the perspective of the sense of virtual community theory, that is the degree of affective attachment to a given community mediated by information technology. Specifically, our research model evaluates the association between the sense of virtual community with use behaviour and the continuous intention to use e-participation. Structural equation modelling was used to evaluate the data collected from 370 citizens who experienced an e-participation platform hosted by a European capital city. We found out that the direct association between the sense of virtual community and use was significant. Even though the direct association between the sense of virtual community and the continuous intention was non-significant, the indirect association sense of virtual community to use to continuous intention was statistically significant. This finding may indicate that the use behaviour is triggered by the influence of other members of the community for a short period of time, but it does not persist to influence the continuous intention over time.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.GIQ.2019.05.009,article

When the relays forward the source signal to the destination, they should dissipate certain power for driving their physical circuits (e.g., amplifiers and filters), in addition to the transmit power required for emitting radio signals. However, no existing work considers the circuit power when exploiting relays for enhancing the wireless security against eavesdropping. We thus propose the relay-selection based cooperative beamforming framework, where partial relays are selected to forward the source signal in a beamforming manner. We present two relay-selection strategies, namely, the exponential-complexity exhaustive search and linear-complexity relay ordering. For comparison purposes, we also evaluate the conventional all-relay based and best-relay based beamforming schemes, where all relays or only the best one is selected to assist the source-destination transmission. It is shown that the proposed beamforming schemes significantly outperform the conventional all-relay and best-relay based beamforming schemes in terms of secrecy capacity.

This transition manifests itself in the widespread adoption of information and communication technologies (ICTs), cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), and other technological tools aimed at improving the level of city smartness. Although numerous studies have focused on the smart city (SC) phenomenon, knowledge about empirical criteria that can be used to define a city as “smart” and to measure the degree of a city's “smartness” remains limited. The present study aims to bridge this knowledge gap by a systematic literature review of recent studies, in which various empirical criteria are used for SC identification. The study helps to identify a total of 48 SC identification metrics, which are further split into three main categories—smart digital technology, living conditions, and environmental (ecological) sustainability. Among these groups of criteria, the “smart digital technology” group of metrics appears to be the most popular, while criteria pertinent to “ecological sustainability” are applied considerably less often. As the study also reveals, only about half of the criteria used by empirical studies for SC identification actually relate to urban residents' needs, with the rest being general technological measures. Therefore, for a balanced SC assessment, we suggest a ranking system based on the nine most important metrics, which equally represent all the main aspects of the SC phenomenon while placing an emphasis on the improvement of the quality of life of local residents.

The widespread diffusion of functional networks increases the complexity of interdependent systems and their vulnerability to large-scale disruptions. Although in recent years studies of interconnections and chain effects have improved significantly, cascading phenomena are often associated with the “toppling domino metaphor”, or with high-impact, low-probability events. This paper aimed to support a paradigm shift in the state of the art by proposing a new theoretical approach to cascading events in terms of their root causes and lack of predictability. By means of interdisciplinary theory building, we demonstrate how cascades reflect the ways in which panarchies collapse.

"Boyd, Danah and Crawford, Kate",2012.0,"{Critical questions for big data: Provocations for a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon","The era of Big Data has begun. Computer scientists, physicists, economists, mathematicians, political scientists, bio-informaticists, sociologists, and other scholars are clamoring for access to the massive quantities of information produced by and about people, things, and their interactions. Diverse groups argue about the potential benefits and costs of analyzing genetic sequences, social media interactions, health records, phone logs, government records, and other digital traces left by people. Significant questions emerge. Will large-scale search data help us create better tools, services, and public goods? Or will it usher in a new wave of privacy incursions and invasive marketing? Will data analytics help us understand online communities and political movements? Or will it be used to track protesters and suppress speech? Will it transform how we study human communication and culture, or narrow the palette of research options and alter what 'research' means? Given the rise of Big Data as a socio-technical phenomenon, we argue that it is necessary to critically interrogate its assumptions and biases. In this article, we offer six provocations to spark conversations about the issues of Big Data: a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon that rests on the interplay of technology, analysis, and mythology that provokes extensive utopian and dystopian rhetoric. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2012.678878,article

A walk through the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City, China","This article uses the narrative tool of a walk through Tianjin Eco-City, China, as an entry point in raising and discussing key questions in contemporary eco-city research. Eco-city projects are becoming increasingly prevalent in policy and political-economic discourses in a variety of locations as new urban spaces where blueprints for low carbon economies can be trialled. In light of this, the article highlights the key necessity of, firstly, considering scale when analyzing eco-city 'futures'. Secondly, the article argues for the need to interrogate eco-cities' definitions, as well as evaluation, performance and monitoring frameworks, as this will aid in critical analyses of the marketing, presentation and actually built urban environments in eco-city projects. Thirdly, the question of internal social resilience and the emergence of communities within newly-built eco-cities needs to be assessed: this is of crucial importance in light of the exclusive, gated nature of several flagship eco-city projects under construction at the time of writing. Lastly, the article argues that research on eco-city projects needs to consider not only the high-tech, new urban environments materialized as eco-cities, but also the production and reproduction of large, often transient populations of low-paid workers who build eco-cities and who form what the article calls the 'new urban poor', forming 'workers' cities' on the edges of flagship 'sustainable' urban projects worldwide. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2013.08.005,article

In recent year, to overcome such safety problems, safety program implementation has been given significant consideration as one of the effective methods. In order to effectively gain from safety programs, factors that affect its implementation need to be studied. This paper identified 16 critical success factors (CSFs) of safety programs from safety literature and previous research and these were thereafter validated by construction safety professionals. The study was conducted through questionnaire surveys with 80 respondents from medium and large-scale construction projects taking part. The survey intended to assess and prioritize the degree of influence of those success factors have on the safety programs as perceived by the respondents. The result showed that the most influential factor is management support. Furthermore, using factor analysis, the 16 CSFs could be grouped into four dimensions: worker involvement, safety prevention and control system, safety arrangement, and management commitment. In order to validate the findings, three case studies were further conducted to test the effect of those success factors on construction safety performance. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.SSCI.2007.06.006,article

We demonstrate that while processes of smart city making have strongly been inclined toward technocratic approaches and deterministic appeals, this inclination is highly deceptive. We argue that rather than being deterministic, these processes are essentially politicized, highly contested, and shaped by the role and impact of local practices and context-specific realities. In making this argument, we draw from a social studies of technology perspective which engages with the notion of technological determinism to make this contribution to the academic field of critical urbanism.",https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2020.1715050,misc

Design/methodology/approach: Grounded in the technology acceptance model (TAM), a research model was developed focusing on e-filing services adoption. Hypotheses were formulated to assess the moderating effect of digital literacy on the relationship between trust and the key TAM determinants of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. A questionnaire-based survey of 876 citizens who have used e-filing using the snow-ball sampling technique was adopted to generate data. The data was analyzed using PLS-SEM through the aid of SmartPLS 4 to assess the measurement model and structural relationships. Findings: Trust positively influences perceived usefulness and ease of use, which in turn drive adoption. Additionally, digital literacy significantly moderates the impact of trust on usefulness and ease of use perceptions – the effect is stronger for higher digital literacy. Research limitations/implications: The study adopted a single country developing economy context limiting cross-cultural applicability. Second, the focus on e-filing adoption precludes insights across other e-government services. Third, the reliance on perceptual measures risks respondent biases and fourth, the study is a cross-sectional survey design. Practical implications: The findings emphasize multifaceted strategies to accelerate e-government adoption. Nurturing citizen trust in e-government systems through enhanced reliability, security and transparency remains vital. Simultaneously, initiatives to cultivate digital access, skills and proficiencies across population segments need to be undertaken. Originality/value: This study integrates trust and digital literacy within the theoretical model to provide a more holistic understanding of adoption determinants.

"Mutambik, Ibrahim",2024.0,{Culturally Informed Technology: Assessing Its Importance in the Transition to Smart Sustainable Cities,"Since the idea of the smart city was first introduced, over two decades ago, there has been an increasing focus on sustainability as a core strategic priority. However, as the relevance, importance and even definition of sustainability is a function of cultural context, planners must take account of local and regional cultural factors in the selection and adaption of digital infrastructures, as well as in the management and encouragement of public acceptance. Achieving this is not a sequential process, but a concurrent one, as these factors are interdependent. This raises the question of what factors affect and mediate the technology, choice, and public acceptance of smart sustainable cities. This paper attempts to address this question by proposing a new model which advances our current, and considerable, understanding of Technology Acceptance Modelling—using an analysis based on Structural Equation Modelling. This new model, called the Culturally Informed Technology Acceptance Model, was validated using data from a survey of residents of a variety of Saudi Arabian cities. The proposed model is designed around important factors that can be influenced by cultural context, such as digital literacy, process improvements, cost savings and privacy, and is a useful tool for understanding the role of culture in the public acceptance of smart sustainable technology. This design focus is for a number of reasons, such as helping development bodies ensure that the technologies used align with the socio-cultural context. It will also help in the management of at-scale technology roll out in a way that is resource-efficient. Although the Culturally Informed Technology Acceptance Model has been developed and validated using data from Saudi Arabia, the authors believe that it could be adapted to meet the needs of countries/cities that are looking to implement smart city strategies matched to their own distinct socio-cultural identity.",https://doi.org/10.3390/SU16104075,article

As Latinx sexual minority men, particularly those who are foreign-born, experience inequitable access to health services, tailored strategies to engage them for HIV prevention are urgently needed. Objective: Our study seeks to address the need for enhanced access to HIV prevention among Latinx immigrant sexual minority men. We developed and piloted a culturally sensitive technology-based campaign focused on HIV testing and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) uptake. Methods: We used a two-phase approach to assess the feasibility of community-informed social media content in engaging Latinx immigrant sexual minority men for HIV testing and PrEP use. First, we conducted three iterative focus groups with 15 Latinx immigrant sexual minority men to refine the HIV prevention content to be piloted on social media platforms. The finalized content was placed on Instagram and Facebook for 9 days in July and September 2021 to individuals who were in Washington State. Individuals who clicked on the content were directed to a website with additional HIV prevention information. Second, we conducted online surveys (n=60) with website visitors that assessed sociodemographic characteristics, barriers to HIV prevention, and HIV-related transmission risk and prevention behaviors. We conducted descriptive analyses to examine the overall profile of survey respondents and determine the feasibility of culturally informed social media content in reaching Latinx immigrant sexual minority men. Results: Overall, 739 unique users visited the website during the 9-day period when the social media content was posted on Instagram and Facebook. Our sample included 60 Latinx immigrant sexual minority men who completed the online survey. Participants'mean age was 30.8 years and more than half (n=34, 57%) completed the survey in Spanish. A quarter of participants indicated that they were unauthorized immigrants and 57% (n=34) reported not having medical insurance. Participants reported, on average, having 6 different sexual partners in the last 6 months. Nearly a third of respondents had not tested for HIV in the last 6 months. Only about half (n=32, 53%) of respondents had used PrEP in the last 12 months. Conclusions: Community-driven social media and web-based strategies are feasible ways to engage Latinx immigrant sexual minority men who may traditionally lack access to HIV prevention information and services due to structural and social barriers. The results highlight that culturally relevant social media and web-based outreach strategies that are informed and developed by the community can reach Latinx immigrant sexual minority men for HIV prevention. Findings underscore the need to examine the effectiveness of social media content in promoting HIV testing and PrEP uptake in marginalized Latinx populations.",https://doi.org/10.2196/36446,article

This paper provides with a comprehensive understanding of the notion of SC through the elaboration of a taxonomy of pertinent application domains, namely: natural resources and energy, transport and mobility, buildings, living, government, and economy and people. It also explores the diffusion of smart initiatives via an empirical study aimed at investigating the ratio of domains covered by a city's best practices to the total of potential domains of smart initiatives and at understanding the role that various economic, urban, demographic, and geographical variables might have in influencing the planning approach to create a smarter city. Results reveal that the evolution patterns of a SC highly depend on its local context factors. In particular, economic development and structural urban variables are likely to influence a city's digital path, the geographical location to affect the SC strategy, and density of population, with its associated congestion problems, might an important component to determine the routes for the SC implementation. This work provides policy makers and city managers with useful guidelines to define and drive their SC strategy and planning actions towards the most appropriate domains of implementation. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.CITIES.2013.12.010,article

As the first digital health program communicating with people at scale, MomConnect enrolled more than half a million women from all regions of the country in the first year of operation, representing approximately half the number of pregnancies in the public health sector. MomConnect uses a mobile phone application to support a pregnancy registration system in antenatal care facilities, allowing pregnant women to receive stage-based messages to help them improve their health and that of their babies. Women can self-subscribe or be subscribed by community health workers to receive a limited set of health-promotion messages. Registered users interact with the system by rating the service received, asking questions, and submitting compliments or complaints. The mobile system connects to a central health-information exchange that facilitates interoperability between digital health applications and includes data validation, a national pregnancy registry and a monitoring and reporting system. Used throughout the health system at facility level, MomConnect has generated a national register of pregnant individuals and set up a national feedback system to clients. As such, it is an exemplar implementation of the Health Normative Standards Framework enabling national-level innovation as a model for future health system strengthening, enabling interoperability between digital health applications, and achieving universal health coverage.

"Calzada, Igor and Almirall, Esteve",2020.0,{Data ecosystems for protecting European citizens' digital rights,"Purpose: This paper aims to spark a debate by presenting the need for developing data ecosystems in Europe that meet the social and public good while committing to democratic and ethical standards; suggesting a taxonomy of data infrastructures and institutions to support this need; using the case study of Barcelona as the flagship city trailblazing a critical policy agenda of smart cities to show the limitations and contradictions of the current state of affairs; and ultimately, proposing a preliminary roadmap for institutional and governance empowerment that could enable effective data ecosystems in Europe. Design/methodology/approach: This paper draws on lessons learned in previous publications available in the sustainability (Calzada, 2018), regions (Calzada and Cowie, 2017; Calzada, 2019), Zenodo (Calzada and Almirall, 2019), RSA Journal (Calzada, 2019) and IJIS (Calzada, 2020) journals and ongoing and updated fieldwork about the Barcelona case study stemming from an intensive fieldwork action research that started in 2017. The methodology used in these publications was based on the mixed-method technique of triangulation via action research encompassing in-depth interviews, direct participation in policy events and desk research. The case study was identified as the most effective methodology. Findings: This paper, drawing from lessons learned from the Barcelona case study, elucidates on the need to establish pan-European data infrastructures and institutions – collectively data ecosystems – to protect citizens' digital rights in European cities and regions. The paper reveals three main priorities proposing a preliminary roadmap for local and regional governments, namely, advocacy, suggesting the need for city and regional networks; governance, requiring guidance and applied, neutral and non-partisan research in policy; and pan-European agencies, leading and mobilising data infrastructures and institutions at the European level. Research limitations/implications: From the very beginning, this paper acknowledges its ambition, and thus its limitations and clarifies its attempt to provide just an overview rather than a deep research analysis. This paper presents several research limitations and implications regarding the scope. The paper starts by presenting the need for data ecosystems, then structures this need through two taxonomies, all illustrated through the Barcelona case study and finally, concludes with a roadmap consisting of three priorities. The paper uses previous published and ongoing fieldwork findings in Barcelona as a way to lead, and thus encourage the proliferation of more cases through Cities Coalition for Digital Rights (CCDR). Practical implications: This paper presents practical implications for local and regional authorities of the CCDR network. As such, the main three priorities of the preliminary roadmap could help those European cities and regions already part of the CCDR network to establish and build operational data ecosystems by establishing a comprehensive pan-European policy from the bottom-up that aligns with the timely policy developments advocated by the European Commission. This paper can inspire policymakers by providing guidelines to better coordinate among a diverse set of cities and regions in Europe. Social implications: The leading data governance models worldwide from China and the USA and the advent of Big Data are dramatically reshaping citizens' relationship with data. Against this backdrop and directly influenced by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Europe has, perhaps, for the first time, spoken with its own voice by blending data and smart city research and policy formulations. Inquiries and emerging insights into the potential urban experiments on data ecosystems, consisting of data infrastructures and institutions operating in European cities and regions, become increasingly crucial. Thus, the main social implications are for those multi-stakeholder policy schemes already operating in European cities and regions. Originality/value: In previous research, data ecosystems were not directly related to digital rights amidst the global digital geopolitical context and, more specifically, were not connected to the two taxonomies (on data infrastructures and institutions) that could be directly applied to a case study, like the one presented about Barcelona. Thus, this paper shows novelty and originality by also opening up (based on previous fieldwork action research) a way to take strategic action to establish a pan-European strategy among cities and regions through three specific priorities. This paper can ultimately support practice and lead to new research and policy avenues.",https://doi.org/10.1108/TG-03-2020-0047,article

Expert international contributors consider political questions about data and the ways it provokes subjects to govern themselves by making rights claims. Concerned with the things (infrastructures of servers, devices, and cables) and language (code, programming, and algorithms) that make up cyberspace, this book demonstrates that without understanding these conditions of possibility it is impossible to intervene in or to shape data politics.

A data-driven geography may be emerging in response to the wealth of georeferenced data flowing from sensors and people in the environment. Although this may seem revolutionary, in fact it may be better described as evolutionary. Some of the issues raised by data-driven geography have in fact been longstanding issues in geographic research, namely, large data volumes, dealing with populations and messy data, and tensions between idiographic versus nomothetic knowledge. The belief that spatial context matters is a major theme in geographic thought and a major motivation behind approaches such as time geography, disaggregate spatial statistics and GIScience.

"Bibri, Simon Elias",2021.0,{Data-driven smart sustainable cities of the future: An evidence synthesis approach to a comprehensive state-of-the-art literature review,"Sustainable cities are currently undergoing unprecedented transformative changes in light of the recent paradigm shift in science and technology brought on by big data science and analytics. These marked changes are motivated by the increased need to tackle the problematicity surrounding sustainable cities as quintessential complex systems in terms of their development planning, operational management, and fragmentary design strategies and technology solutions. That is to say, sustainable cities are increasingly embracing and leveraging what smart cities have to offer in terms of big data technologies and their novel applications in an attempt to effectively deal with the complexities they inherently embody and to monitor, evaluate, and improve their performance with respect to sustainability—under what has been termed “data-driven smart sustainable cities.” This new area is a significant gap in and of itself—as it is still in its infancy—that this paper seeks to fill together with to what extent the integration of sustainable urbanism and smart urbanism is addressed and what directions and forms it takes. Using a compelling evidence synthesis approach, this paper provides a comprehensive state-of-the-art literature review of the flourishing field of data-driven smart sustainable cities. This study corroborates that big data technologies will change sustainable urbanism in fundamental and irreversible ways, bringing new and innovative ways of monitoring, understanding, analyzing, planning, and managing sustainable cities. It reveals that the evolving development planning approaches and operational management mechanisms enabled by data-driven technologies are of crucial importance to increase and maintain the contribution of sustainable cities to the goals of sustainability in the face of urbanization. However, what smart urbanism entails and the way it functions raises several critical questions, including whether the policy and governance of data-driven smart sustainable cities of the future will become too technocentric and technocratic respectively, but also with regard to other aspects of social and environmental sustainability. Addressing these important contemporary concerns is of equal importance in achieving the desired outcomes of sustainability. This review and critique of the existing work on the prevailing and emerging paradigms of urbanism provides a valuable reference for scholars and practitioners and the necessary material to inform them of the latest developments in the burgeoning field of data-driven smart sustainable cities. In addition, by shedding light on the increasing adoption and uptake of big data technologies in sustainable urbanism, this study seeks to help policymakers and planners assess the pros and cons of smart urbanism when effectuating sustainable urban transformations in the era of big data, as well as to stimulate prospective research and further critical debates on the topic.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.SFTR.2021.100047,article

The current paper addressed beliefs concerning how periods of small emission cuts contribute to the total CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, by asking participants to rate the atmospheric CO2 concentration for various time periods and emission rates. The participants thought that a time period with higher emission rates combined with a period of lower emission rates generates less atmospheric CO2 in total, compared to the period with high emission rates alone – demonstrating a negative footprint illusion (Study 1). The participants appeared to base their CO2 estimates on the average, rather than on the accumulated sum, of the two periods' emissions – i.e. an averaging bias (Study 2). Moreover, the effect was robust to the wordings of the problem presented to the participants (Study 3).

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can play a significant role in postdisaster assessment as they have low-cost and flexible deployment characteristics. Detecting bushfires in their initial phase is important to save the inhabitants, infrastructure, and ecosystem. In the context of smart cities, we have applied state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) algorithms to detect and differentiate between fire and no-fire regions. However, certain factors like reachability to forest fires and timely detection of the region of interest (ROI) are quite challenging. Therefore, we incorporate UAVs for capturing the real-time images and process these images into our proposed YOLOv5-s (you only look once-small) model that helps achieve fast and accurate detection of the affected region. We have proposed a lightweight single-stage network with an improved bottleneck cross-stage partial (CSP) module and pyramid attention network (PAN) layers to enhance precise feature extraction and reduce computation time in fire detection. Notably, the HardSwish activation function outperformed ReLU in a specific fire detection scenario. Based on the provided dataset, simulation results demonstrate that the optimized model can effectively detect and differentiate between fire and nonfire regions, which may be challenging to discern with the naked eye. The results indicate that the proposed model surpasses existing models, achieving an accuracy of 97.4%, a low false-positive rate of 1.258%, and nonmaximum suppression (NMS) of 3 ms.

"Akhyar, Akhyar and {Asyraf Zulkifley",2024.0,{Deep artificial intelligence applications for natural disaster management systems: A methodological review,"Deep learning techniques through semantic segmentation networks have been widely used for natural disaster analysis and response. The underlying base of these implementations relies on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can accurately and precisely identify and locate the respective areas of interest within satellite imagery or other forms of remote sensing data, thereby assisting in disaster evaluation, rescue planning, and restoration endeavours. Most CNN-based deep-learning models encounter challenges related to the loss of spatial information and insufficient feature representation. This issue can be attributed to their suboptimal design of the layers that capture multiscale-context information and their failure to include optimal semantic information during the pooling procedures. In the early layers of CNNs, the network encodes elementary semantic representations, such as edges and corners, whereas, as the network progresses toward the later layers, it encodes more intricate semantic characteristics, such as complicated geometric shapes. In theory, it is advantageous for a segmentation network to extract features from several levels of semantic representation. This is because segmentation networks generally yield improved results when both simple and intricate feature maps are employed together. This study comprehensively reviews current developments in deep learning methodologies employed to segment remote sensing images associated with natural disasters. Several popular deep learning models, such as SegNet U-Net, FCNs, FCDenseNet, PSPNet, HRNet, and DeepLab, have exhibited notable achievements in various applications, including forest fire delineation, flood mapping, and earthquake damage assessment.

It highlights key features of their work which include: putting the knowledge and capacity of the poor and the savings groups that they form at the core of all their work (with NGOs in a supporting role); keeping politically neutral and negotiating with whoever is in power; driving change through setting precedents (for example, a community-designed and managed toilet, a house design developed collectively by the urban poor that they can build far cheaper than public or private agencies) and using these to negotiate support and changed policies (a strategy that develops new ""legal"" solutions on the poor's own terms); a horizontal structure as the Alliance is underpinned by, accountable to and serves thousands of small savings groups formed mostly by poor women; community-to-community exchange visits that root innovation and learning in what urban poor groups do; and urban poor groups undertaking surveys and censuses to produce their own data about ""slums"" (which official policies lack and need) to help build partnerships with official agencies in ways that strengthen and support their own organizations. The paper notes that these are features shared with urban poor federations and alliances in other countries and it describes the international community exchanges and other links between them. These groups are internationalizing themselves, creating networks of globalization from below. Individually and collectively, they seek to demonstrate to governments (local, regional, national) and international agencies that urban poor groups are more capable than they in poverty reduction, and they also provide these agencies with strong community-based partners through which to do so.

Design: Conceptual discussion. Setting, Patients/Participants, and Main results: not applicable. Conclusions: For the purposes of measurement and operationalisation, equity in health is the absence of systematic disparities in health (or in the major social determinants of health) between groups with different levels of underlying social advantage/disadvantoge - that is, wealth, power, or prestige. Inequities in health systematically put groups of people who are already socially disadvantaged (for example, by virtue of being poor, female, and/or members of a disenfranchised racial, ethnic, or religious group) at further disadvantage with respect to their health; health is essential to wellbeing and to overcoming other effects of social disadvantage. Equity is an ethical principle; it also is consonant with and closely related to human rights principles. The proposed definition of equity supports operationalisation of the right to the highest attainable standard of health as indicated by the health status of the most socially advantaged group. Assessing health equity requires comparing health and its social determinants between more and less advantaged social groups. These comparisons are essential to assess whether national and international policies are leading toward or away from greater social justice in health.",https://doi.org/10.1136/JECH.57.4.254,article

Although green finance policies can effectively ease financing restraints on green innovation overall, green credits are less likely to be available to privately owned enterprises. However, these enterprises which are deeply affected by financing constraints have relatively high innovation capabilities. We suggest the government to provide more supports to privately owned enterprises for investing in green projects.

Jos{\'{e,2023.0,{Design Principles for Platform-Based Innovation in Smart Cities,"Smart Cities represent the next big frontier for computational science. However, the real-world impacts of this transformation have been considerably slower than other domains of digital innovation. In this work, we study the interplay between the core properties of digital platforms and the urban innovation contexts that aim to promote digital transition as a means to generate value for cities and its citizens. The research methodology is based on a literature review, which aimed to characterise the key limitations preventing smart city initiatives from attaining the same level of fast paced innovation as other areas of computational science, and seek for alternative innovation practices. The results suggest that innovation practices in the context of smart city initiatives seem to be framed by a key trade-off between the idea that only global solutions may be able to capture the full benefits of digital innovation and the idea that each city is unique and must pave its own way towards digital transition. From the analysis of those results, we derive five design principles for new service-based platforms. These principles represent a new direction to address the specificities of smart cities and unleash the real-world impact of digital innovation in smart and sustainable cities.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-36808-0_14,article

A new endemic disease has spread across Wuhan City, China, in December 2019. Within few weeks, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a novel coronavirus designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In late January 2020, WHO declared the outbreak of a ""public-health emergency of international concern"" due to the rapid and increasing spread of the disease worldwide. Currently, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for this emerging infection; thus, the objective of this study is to design a multiepitope peptide vaccine against COVID-19 using an immunoinformatics approach. Method. Several techniques facilitating the combination of the immunoinformatics approach and comparative genomic approach were used in order to determine the potential peptides for designing the T-cell epitope-based peptide vaccine using the envelope protein of 2019-nCoV as a target. Results. Extensive mutations, insertion, and deletion were discovered with comparative sequencing in the COVID-19 strain. Additionally, ten peptides binding to MHC class I and MHC class II were found to be promising candidates for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage of 88.5% and 99.99%, respectively. Conclusion. The T-cell epitope-based peptide vaccine was designed for COVID-19 using the envelope protein as an immunogenic target. Nevertheless, the proposed vaccine rapidly needs to be validated clinically in order to ensure its safety and immunogenic profile to help stop this epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks.",https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/2683286,article

We start from the assumption that different governmental political and technical capacities shape different spaces for action and thus different types of policy design in which policy-makers can involve citizens via ICTs in three modes: co-design; design fine-tuning; crowdsourced policy design.

"Hou, Hao and Estoque, Ronald C.",2020.0,{Detecting Cooling Effect of Landscape from Composition and Configuration: An Urban Heat Island Study on Hangzhou,"Rapid urbanization, particularly in developing countries, is widely regarded as one of the most critical global issues in the 21 st century. It is known to exacerbate urban heat island effects, a phenomenon that could affect the livability of cities and the lives and comfort of more than half of the world population who are now living in urban areas. The issue on how to mitigate the impacts of this phenomenon and help urban dwellers adapt to it, has been, and continues to be, an important topic in the context of landscape design and urban planning. This study sought to examine the cooling effects of different land cover types from the perspectives of landscape composition and configuration using Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS data. Various spatial and statistical approaches, including urban-rural gradient, grid-based, landscape metrics, and scatter plot, were employed to analyze the derived land cover and land surface temperature (LST) maps. The results showed that both forest and water had a cooling effect during daytime in Hangzhou. The heat core in Hangzhou was situated close to the central business district and the variance in LST in urban and rural recorded at 3.22 ℃. The correlation of forest density with mean LST could be detected in both large (690 m) and small (210 m) grids, whereas the correlation of water density with mean LST was only observed in small grids. In general, forest with high aggregation and complex shape behave best in cooling LST while huge and complete water bodies had better cooling effect than scattered water patches. Besides, the minimum cooling scale of forest and water were proximately 120 m and 150 m from the cooling resources to the neighboring areas, respectively. The findings were considered valuable for urban planners to spatially and architecturally build and arrange the cooling land cover resources, eventually to fulfill the Chinese government's new plan of building “livable cities”.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2020.126719,article

In addition to seasonal influenza, a new strain of influenza virus against which no previous immunity exists and that demonstrates human-to-human transmission could result in a pandemic with millions of fatalities. Early detection of disease activity, when followed by a rapid response, can reduce the impact of both seasonal and pandemic influenza. One way to improve early detection is to monitor health-seeking behaviour in the form of queries to online search engines, which are submitted by millions of users around the world each day. Here we present a method of analysing large numbers of Google search queries to track influenza-like illness in a population. Because the relative frequency of certain queries is highly correlated with the percentage of physician visits in which a patient presents with influenza-like symptoms, we can accurately estimate the current level of weekly influenza activity in each region of the United States, with a reporting lag of about one day. This approach may make it possible to use search queries to detect influenza epidemics in areas with a large population of web search users. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1038/NATURE07634,article

This study also analyzes the obstacles in implementing the LS framework as incubation metrics. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses mixed methods. Quantitative research using multiple linear regression was applied to the data of 30 start-ups incubated at Bandung Techno Park for the 2014–2017 period and survival tracking data after the incubation. A qualitative approach to complete the explanatory work was conducted through in-depth interviews with 12 respondents, including start-up graduates from the incubation program, program managers and mentors. Findings: This study confirms that several LS incubation metrics significantly affect start-up sustainability after incubation. In addition, this study also explains several problems in applying the LS discipline that needs attention to increase incubation success. Research limitations/implications: Research was conducted only at one technology business incubator (TBI) model that focuses on digital start-ups in the emerging ecosystem. Research results can be biased in different situations and ecosystems. Practical implications: The explanation of the relationship of LS-based incubation metrics to the survival of start-ups, as well as the challenges of their implementation, can be a reference for TBI management to consider and prioritize intervention strategies, thereby improving TBI's business processes and increasing the success rate of incubated start-ups. Social implications: The creation of university start-ups and spin-offs has become a key performance indicator mandatory for technology universities in Indonesia. The existence of TBI institutions in universities as channels of technology commercialization is essential. The incubator's success in creating a new technology-based company will have a significant social impact on the surrounding environment. Originality/value: Although the LS method is popular in start-up communities and among practitioners, it is rarely used in the incubation process at universities.

However, very little research has been conducted to understand how that perception forms and changes over time. The current work presents and tests an anchoring and adjustment-based theoretical model of the determinants of system-specific perceived ease of use. The model proposes control (internal and external - conceptualized as computer self-efficacy and facilitating conditions, respectively), intrinsic motivation (conceptualized as computer playfulness), and emotion (conceptualized as computer anxiety) as anchors that determine early perceptions about the ease of use of a new system. With increasing experience, it is expected that system-specific perceived ease of use, while still anchored to the general beliefs regarding computers and computer use, will adjust to reflect objective usability, perceptions of external control specific to the new system environment, and system-specific perceived enjoyment. The proposed model was tested in three different organizations among 246 employees using three measurements taken over a three-month period. The proposed model was strongly supported at all points of measurement, and explained up to 60% of the variance in system-specific perceived ease of use, which is twice as much as our current understanding.

"Layne, Karen and Lee, Jungwoo",2001.0,{Developing fully functional E-government: A four stage model,"Literature reports the experiences with e-government initiatives as chaotic and unmanageable, despite recent numerous initiatives at different levels of government and academic and practitioners' conferences on e-government. E-government presents a number of challenges for public administrators. To help public administrators think about e-government and their organizations, this article describes different stages of e-government development and proposes a 'stages of growth' model for fully functional e-government. Various government websites and related e-government initiatives help to ground and explain this model. These stages outline the multi-perspective transformation within government structures and functions as they make transitions to e-government through each stage. Technological and organizational challenges for each stage accompany these descriptions. At the same time, this paper describes how the e-government becomes amalgamated with traditional public administrative structure. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/S0740-624X(01)00066-1,article

During the 2014-2016 West African Ebola epidemic, paper-based data collection systems at ETCs compromised the quality, quantity, and confidentiality of patient data. Electronic health record (EHR) systems have the potential to address such problems, with benefits for patient care, surveillance, and research. However, no suitable software was available for deployment when large-scale ETCs opened as the epidemic escalated in 2014. Objective: We present our work on rapidly developing and deploying OpenMRS-Ebola, an EHR system for the Kerry Town ETC in Sierra Leone. We describe our experience, lessons learned, and recommendations for future health emergencies. Methods: We used the OpenMRS platform and Agile software development approaches to build OpenMRS-Ebola. Key features of our work included daily communications between the development team and ground-based operations team, iterative processes, and phased development and implementation. We made design decisions based on the restrictions of the ETC environment and regular user feedback. To evaluate the system, we conducted predeployment user questionnaires and compared the EHR records with duplicate paper records. Results: We successfully built OpenMRS-Ebola, a modular stand-alone EHR system with a tablet-based application for infectious patient wards and a desktop-based application for noninfectious areas. OpenMRS-Ebola supports patient tracking (registration, bed allocation, and discharge); recording of vital signs and symptoms; medication and intravenous fluid ordering and monitoring; laboratory results; clinician notes; and data export. It displays relevant patient information to clinicians in infectious and noninfectious zones. We implemented phase 1 (patient tracking; drug ordering and monitoring) after 2.5 months of full-time development. OpenMRS-Ebola was used for 112 patient registrations, 569 prescription orders, and 971 medication administration recordings. We were unable to fully implement phases 2 and 3 as the ETC closed because of a decrease in new Ebola cases. The phase 1 evaluation suggested that OpenMRS-Ebola worked well in the context of the rollout, and the user feedback was positive. Conclusions: To our knowledge, OpenMRS-Ebola is the most comprehensive adaptable clinical EHR built for a low-resource setting health emergency. It is designed to address the main challenges of data collection in highly infectious environments that require robust infection prevention and control measures and it is interoperable with other electronic health systems. Although we built and deployed OpenMRS-Ebola more rapidly than typical software, our work highlights the challenges of having to develop an appropriate system during an emergency rather than being able to rapidly adapt an existing one. Lessons learned from this and previous emergencies should be used to ensure that a set of well-designed, easy-to-use, pretested health software is ready for quick deployment in future.",https://doi.org/10.2196/jmir.7881,article
"Moore, Gary C. and Benbasat, Izak",1991.0,{Development of an instrument to measure the perceptions of adopting an information technology innovation,"This paper reports on the development of an instrument designed to measure the various perceptions that an individual may have of adopting an information technology (IT) innovation. This instrument is intended to be a tool for the study of the initial adoption and eventual diffusion of IT innovations within organizations. While the adoption of information technologies by individuals and organizations has been an area of substantial research interest since the early days of computerization, research efforts to date have led to mixed and inconclusive outcomes. The lack of a theoretical foundation for such research and inadequate definition and measurement of constructs have been identified as major causes for such outcomes. In a recent study examining the diffusion of new end-user IT, we decided to focus on measuring the potential adopters' perceptions of the technology. Measuring such perceptions has been termed a ""classic issue"" in the innovation diffusion literature, and a key to integrating the various findings of diffusion research. The perceptions of adopting were initially based on the five characteristics of innovations derived by Rogers (1983) from the diffusion of innovations literature, plus two developed specifically within this study. Of the existing scales for measuring these characteristics, very few had the requisite levels of validity and reliability. For this study, both newly created and existing items were placed in a common pool and subjected to four rounds of sorting by judges to establish which items should be in the various scales. The objective was to verify the convergent and discriminant validity of the scales by examining how the items were sorted into various construct categories. Analysis of inter- judge agreement about item placement identified both bad items as well as weaknesses in some of the constructs' original definitions. These were subsequently redefined. Scales for the resulting constructs were subjected to three separate field tests. Following the final test, the scales all demonstrated acceptable levels of reliability. Their validity was further checked using factor analysis, as well as conducting discriminant analysis comparing responses between adopters and nonadopters of the innovation. The result is a parsimonious, 38-item instrument comprising eight scales which provides a useful tool for the study of the initial adoption and diffusion of innovations. A short, 25-item, version of the instrument is also suggested. Copyright {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1287/ISRE.2.3.192,article

However, the urban infrastructure to support sustainable mobility can produce a substantial environmental burden if no life cycle environmental criteria are applied in its design and management. This paper demonstrates the potential to support energy-efficient and CO2-free pedestrian and electric bike (e-bike) mobility through the ecological design (eco-design) of urban elements. An eco-design approach is applied to reconceptualize a conventional pergola toward an eco-product (solar pergola). The solar pergola generates surplus photovoltaic electricity that provides a multifunctional character. According to the end-use of this energy, different scenarios are analyzed for robust decision-making. The deployment of solar pergolas can contribute to save from 2,080kg to over 47,185kg of CO2 eq. and from 350,390MJ to over 692,760MJ eq. in 10 years, depending on the geographic emplacement (solar radiation and electricity grid system). These savings are equivalent to charging 2-9 e-bikes per day using clean energy. Instead of maximizing infrastructure deployment to shift to environmentally friendly modes of mobility, the implementation of multifunctional urban elements represents a key area of action in the context of smart city development.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2015.05.022,article
"ELGhamrawy, Sally M and Hassanien, Abou Ellah",2020.0,{Diagnosis and Prediction Model for COVID19 Patients Response to Treatment based on Convolutional Neural Networks and Whale Optimization Algorithm Using CT Images,"The outbreak of coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) has rabidly spread all over the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that coronavirus COVID-19 is an international pandemic. The Real-Time Reverse transcription-polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) has a low positive and sensitivity rate in the early stage of COVID-19. As a result, the Computed Tomography (CT) imaging is used for diagnosing. COVID-19 has different key signs on a CT scan differ from other viral pneumonia. These signs include ground-glass opacities, consolidations, and crazy paving. In this paper, an Artificial Intelli-gence-inspired Model for COVID-19 Diagnosis and Prediction for Patient Response to Treatment (AIMDP) is proposed. AIMDP model has two main functions reflected in two proposed modules, namely, the Diagnosis Module (DM) and Prediction Module (PM). The Diagnosis Module (DM) is proposed for early and accurately detecting the patients with COVID-19 and distinguish it from other viral pneumonias using COVID-19 signs obtained from CT scans. The DM model, uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as a Deep learning technique for segmentation, can process hundreds of CT images in seconds to speed up diagnosis of COVID-19 and contribute in its containment. In addition, some countries haven't the ability to provide all patients with the treatment and intensive care services, so it will be mandatory to give treatment to only responding patients. In this context, the Prediction Module (PM) is proposed for predicting the ability of the patient to respond to treatment based on different factors e.g. age, infection stage, respiratory failure, multi-organ failure and the treatment regimens. PM implement the Whale Optimization Algorithm for selecting the most relevant patient's features. The experimental results show promising performance for the proposed diagnosing and prediction modules, using a dataset with hundreds of real data and CT images.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThere is no Funding appliedAuthor DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

The literature on gender and technology use finds that women and men differ significantly in their attitudes toward their technological abilities. Concurrently, existing work on science and math abilities of students suggests that such perceived differences do not always translate into actual disparities. We examine the yet-neglected area concerning gender differences with respect to Internet-use ability. In particular, we test how self-perceived abilities are related to actual abilities and how these may differ by gender. Methods. We use new data on web-use skill to test empirically whether there are differences in men's and women's abilities to navigate online content. We draw on a diverse sample of adult Internet users to investigate the questions raised. Results. Findings suggest that men and women do not differ greatly in their online abilities. However, we find that women's self-assessed skill is significantly lower than that of men. Conclusions. Women's lower self-assessment regarding their web-use skills may affect significantly the extent of their online behavior and the types of uses to which they put the medium. We discuss the implications of these findings for social inequality. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1540-6237.2006.00389.X,article

There may be an initial period of happiness followed by peaks of stressful periods. These reactions along with socio-economic changes are likely to influence their health, which may start converging towards the average health of the host population. We used a longitudinal analysis to assess the differences in health outcomes (mental health and self-rated health), separately in men and women, in Canadian born and immigrants over a 12-year period (and the associated socio-economic factors). We used random effects logistic regression models for evaluation of these health outcomes in 3,081 men and 4,187 women from the National Population Health Survey (1994/ 95 to 2006/07). After adjusting for all the covariates, nonwhite immigrants were less likely to have severe psychological distress compared with the Canadian born individuals [odds ratio (OR) Men: 0.49, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.24-1.00, Women-OR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.32-0.92]. Immigrant women (white and non-white) were more likely to rate their health as poor through this 12-year period than the Canadian born women (White-OR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.17-2.64; Non-white-OR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.01-3.28). Immigrants in the lowest income adequacy category reported higher psychological distress and poorer health than those in the highest income categories. We did not find any significant differences in the mental health and self-rated health of Canadian men and white male immigrants throughout this 12-year period. Though, non-white immigrant women were less likely to have severe psychological distress through this 12 year period, they were the ones most likely to rate their health as poor. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1007/S10903-010-9408-7,article
"Jaglin, Sylvy",2008.0,{Differentiating networked services in Cape Town: Echoes of splintering urbanism?,"The central focus of this paper is on the differentiation of basic urban trading services in middle income cities and its role in service provision for the poor. Most studies dedicated to service delivery to the poor emphasize the inequalities pertaining from a growing differentiation in provision and take up some of the arguments of the splintering urbanism thesis. The paper examines some of the main claims made in this debate through a case study of Cape Town (South Africa). It illustrates how differentiation is implemented through service levels and tariffs and suggests that it is a pragmatic way of accommodating social and spatial disparities in a highly polarized city, while making progressive steps in favour of the poor. The main argument is that, in Cape Town like in many middle income cities, urban diversity restricts the relevance of conventional social policies and the scope of local solidarity with regard to service delivery. The differentiation of provision is thus a strategy to bring the diversity within the public service, and hence to preserve an institutional and financial public capacity of delivering subsidized services to the poor. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.GEOFORUM.2008.04.010,article

Special emphasis is placed on determining not only the success factors for adequate innovation diffusion, but also on enabling a successful adoption to take place. Key finding obtained from the proposed integrative model is that there are three main stages for adopting DOI in SD projects that are creation of innovative ideas in SD projects, DOI ideas in SD projects, and adoption of innovative ideas in sustainable development projects. Each one of these stages leads to two possibilities that are the success or failure of that stage, depending of the fulfillment of the suggested factors for each option.

However, the most marginalised communities are often the least connected and participate least in digital citizenship programmes. Much existing literature rests on a binary understanding of citizens as being either connected or unconnected. Progress is therefore often understood simply as a process of “connecting the unconnected.” This paper presents primary empirical research from the Philippines, which suggests that such binary understandings disguise more than they reveal. We argue that it is descriptively more accurate and more analytically useful to recognise that multiple classes of technology access exist, which limit digital citizenship in multiple ways. Qualitative methods were used to learn from non-users and the least connected about the barriers to online civic participation that they experience. The 5'A's of Technology Access was employed as a framework to analyse those barriers and reveal the social and economic factors that they reflect, reproduce, and amplify. Findings suggest that nonbinary and nontechnical understandings of the barriers to digital inclusion are essential to any effective attempt to remove the remaining obstacles to genuinely inclusive digital citizenship.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ISD2.12084,article

On this basis, the impact of the digital economy on the urban resilience of 185 prefecture-level cities in China from 2011 to 2019 was analyzed using a benchmark regression model, spatial econometric model, and mediating effect model. This study shows the following: (1) The development of the digital economy has a positive impact on improving urban resilience. (2) The digital economy affects urban resilience with positive spatial spillover effects, and the temporal heterogeneity and heterogeneity of external openness levels are significant, while the regional heterogeneity is not significant. (3) The digital economy can improve urban resilience through the intermediary role of technological innovation. In the future, we should strengthen digital construction, deeply integrate the relationship between the digital economy, technological innovation, and urban resilience, give full play to the engine role of the digital economy, and further promote the enhancement of sustainable urban development.",https://doi.org/10.3390/SU15129250,article

Good governance is crucial to managing efficiently all kind of resources, including natural resources, for the well-being of current and future generations. Digital transformation can be a key driver of changes in governments if they want to enhance transparency, accountability and efficiency. E-government facilitates integrated policies and public services to promote sustainable and inclusive economic growth, social development and environmental protection. E-government contributes to efficient resource management, and so can help to improve namely natural resource usage in the present to avoid damage to their usage in the future. The aim of this study is to analyse the impact of e-government on sustainable development. Using a logit model, for a sample of 103 countries in the period 2003–2018, the results suggest that e-government development is a positive determinant for a country to attain sustainable development, proxied by adjusted net savings, that embraces a country's economic, social and environmental development. This study provides evidence that e-government increases the probability to attain sustainable development mostly in developing and transition economies. The results also suggest that economic growth and gross national income per capita are significant positive influences in sustainable development in the whole sample and that countries with lower age dependency and natural resource rents are more likely to have sustainable development. Developing e-government allows promoting sustainable development, particularly in developing and in transition economies.",https://doi.org/10.1007/S13132-021-00749-2,article
"Waller, Paul",2016.0,{Digital Government: Overcoming the Systemic Failure of Transformation. Digital Transformation Through Policy Design with ICT-Enhanced Instruments.,"The “transformation of government” has often been proposed as an objective of e-government; frequently presented as a phase in stage models following the provision online of information and transactions. Yet in literature or official documents there is no established definition of transformation as applied to government. Implicitly or explicitly, it mostly refers to a change in organisational form, signalled by the terms “joining-up” or “integration”, of government. In some work, transformation is limited to changing processes or “services” — though “services” is a term unhelpfully applied to a multitude of entities.   There is in academic or other literature little evidence of any type of “transformation” achieved beyond a change in an administrative process, nor a robust framework of benefits one might deliver. This begs the questions of what it actually means in reality and why it might be a desired goal.   In essence, what we aim to do in this paper is to develop a structured frame of reference for making sense of how information and communications technologies (ICT), in all their forms, really fit within the world of government and public administration.  After a brief historical review, the paper starts by considering what governments and public administrations actually do: specifically, policy design and implementation through policy instruments. It redefines transformation in terms of changing the policy instrument set chosen to implement policy and sets out broad rationales for how and why ICT can enable this. It proposes a frame of reference of terminology, concepts and objects that enable the examination of not only such transformation, but e-government in general as it has developed over two decades.  This last is done, with suggestions on several areas where more research or development of the detail is required. In an annex, there are tabulations of the components of policy design, types of policy instrument, and potential aspects of instrument selection, tuning and administration that might be enhanced through using ICT or data.   Our way of viewing the issues supports a review of past e-government practice and research, which critiques the predominant approaches that are based on flawed models of government as a service industry and thus have stymied progress. The paper points to ways forward for practice and further research. It draws mainly on UK illustrations with which we are familiar, but its principles are applicable across most nations.",https://doi.org/10.2139/SSRN.2803233,article

This paper employed the scoping review approach to map the situations and research methods of the digital divide among older immigrants from recent empirical studies. The initial search identified 997 articles, of which 13 articles were selected for this review. The results showed that socioeconomic status, language proficiency, degree of acculturation, level of education, and digital literacy are the most common factors leading to the disparities between native older adults and older immigrants. Although the results showed a narrowing gap as concerns access to the Internet, interventions are needed to reduce the divide among individuals of different ethnicities due to disparities in digital skills and knowledge. The included studies applied quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-method approaches. The homogeneity of the findings of some included studies implied the need to develop more methods and models to study the digital divide among older immigrants.

It encompasses various dimensions, including geographical, socioeconomic, and racial/ethnic disparities. Unequal access to digital technologies can exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities, limiting individuals' potential, and hindering societal progress. Geographically, there are significant disparities between rural and urban areas, as well as between developing and developed countries.

Thus, there is a huge demand for disaster risk management using digitalisation as a key enabler for effective and efficient disaster risk management systems. It is widely accepted that digital and intelligence technologies can help solve key aspects of disaster risk management such as disaster prevention and mitigation, and rescue and recovery. Digital Twin (DT) is one of the most promising technologies for multi-stage management which offers significant potential to advance disaster resilience. Smart Cities (SCs) use pervasive information and communications technology to monitor activities in the city. With increasingly large applications of DTs combined with big data generated from sensors in a SC, it is now possible to create Digital Twin Smart Cities (DTSCs). Despite the increasing prevalence of DTSC technologies and their profound impact on disaster risk management, a systematic and longitudinal view of the evolution to the current status of DTSC for disaster risk management does not exist. This review analyses 312 titles and abstracts and 72 full papers. To begin with, a scientific review of DT and SC is undertaken, where the evolution of DTSCs is reviewed. In addition, the intelligence technologies used in DTSCs for disaster risk management are assessed and their benefits are evaluated. Furthermore, the evolution and technical feasibility of DTSC-driven disaster risk management is evaluated by assessing current applications of DTSCs in disaster risk management. It was found that despite the significant potential benefits offered by DTSCs, they also add a new layer of complexities and challenges inherent to these technologies to the already complex web of complexities involved in disaster risk management. These challenges can be addressed by understanding how the process of utilising DTSCs in disaster risk reduction and sustainability is designed, which is essential for comprehending what DTSCs may offer, how it is implemented, and what it means to all involved stakeholders. This paper contributes to the knowledge by improving the understanding of the current status of DTSC technologies and their impact on disaster risk management, and articulating the challenges in implementing DTSC, which inspires the professional community to advance these technologies to address them in future research.",https://doi.org/10.3390/SU151511910,article

This makes them vulnerable to a wide range of threats that can lead to major incidents. Resilience is a concept that describes a system's ability to absorb and respond to disturbances, as well as to learn from the past and anticipate new threats. In this article, we apply the Digital Twin concept to the infrastructure domain to improve the system's resilience capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive requirements analysis related to infrastructure characteristics, crisis management and resilience measures. As a result, we propose a Digital Twin Conceptual Framework for critical infrastructures.

Specifically, six case studies of DTs are compared, illustrating their application, content, technological infrastructure, and priority results. The projects presented provide an overview of the existing DT typologies, focusing on the evaluative/prefigurative use and the limits/potential of the tool in light of the socio-health, climate, and environmental crises. Reflections on DT reveal, on the one hand, its potential role in supporting decision-making and participatory processes and, on the other, the potential utopian trend of data-driven planning encouraged by public-private investments in the smart city/twin city sector. In conclusion, the study underlines the innovative role of DT as a cutting-edge scientific format in the disciplinary framework but highlights that the practical use of the tool is still in an experimental research-action phase. From this theoretical-critical review, it is possible to hypothesise new research paths to implement the realism and application potential of DTs for urban planning and urban governance.",https://doi.org/10.3390/SU14106263,article

"Ghaith, Maysara and Yosri, Ahmed and El-Dakhakhni, Wael",2022.0,{Digital Twin: A City-Scale Flood Imitation Framework,"Global warming has been observed for decades, and associated climate change is expected to increase the frequency of rare severe events. In Canada, floods are the costliest climate change-induced disasters. For example, the damage cost due to the 2013 flood in Calgary was around $5 billion. Similar devastating floods occurred in other Canadian regions over the past decade. This demonstrate that the cities in Canada are in need for effective decision support tools that can enable the proper and rapid actions under flood events. However, a city must be replicated either physically or virtually such that the inherited complex nature and interdependence between the city's subsystems are efficiently captured. Emerging technologies, advanced communication systems, and ongoing software development facilitate the virtual representation of a city in a digital twin. This study lays a framework to devise a city digital twin under flood hazards through the integration of data acquisition systems, hydrology and hydraulic modeling, physical infrastructures and entities, demographic information, and real-time system behavior. To demonstrate the applicability and viability of the framework, a digital twin of the city of Calgary is developed and subsequently calibrated using the historical flood that affected the city in 2013. Digital twins developed based on this framework can be employed to: (1) provide a continuous imitation of hazards affecting the city infrastructures; (2) identify vulnerable locations across the city under hazardous events; (3) enhance the city resilience under climate-induced hazards; and (4) develop reliable preparedness plans and risk mitigation strategies under climate-related hazards.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-19-1065-4_48,article

Although digital twins have received considerable attention in the Industrial Internet of Things domain, their utilization in smart cities has not been as popular thus far. We discuss here the open challenges in the field and argue that digital twins in smart cities should be treated differently and be considered as cyber-physical 'systems of systems', due to the vastly different system size, complexity and requirements, when compared to other recent applications of digital twins.

This article makes an inventory of 5 years of digital divide research (2000-2005). The article focuses on three questions. (1) To what type of inequality does the digital divide concept refer? (2) What is new about the inequality of access to and use of ICTs as compared to other scarce material and immaterial resources? (3) Do new types of inequality exist or rise in the information society? The results of digital divide research are classified under four successive types of access: motivational, physical, skills and usage. A shift of attention from physical access to skills and usage is observed. In terms of physical access the divide seems to be closing in the most developed countries; concerning digital skills and the use of applications the divide persists or widens. Among the shortcomings of digital divide research are its lack of theory, conceptual definition, interdisciplinary approach, qualitative research and longitudinal research. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.POETIC.2006.05.004,article

In 2021, the Italian government made a massive investment in digitizing PA as part of an extraordinary recovery plan, with more than 200 billion euro to revitalize the country. This paper aims to investigate how educational inequalities affect the relationship between Italian citizens and PA in this phase of the digital transition. The study is based on a web survey conducted in March and April 2022 among a national sample of 3,000 citizens aged 18–64. The data shows that more than three-quarters of respondents have already used a public service at least once via an online channel. Few are aware of the reform plan, however, and more than one-third fear that the digitization of public services will make things worse for citizens. Through a regression analysis, the study confirms the centrality of the influence of education on the use of digital public services compared to the other spatial and social variables considered. Trust in PA is also correlated with education and employment status and is higher among those who have used digital public services. The survey thus highlights that the educational and cultural dimension is a crucial aspect as a lever to counter the digital divide and promote digital citizenship rights. It reveals the need to activate facilitation and accompaniment processes for citizens with less digital skills and experience who risk being excluded or penalized by the new arrangement and having their distrust toward the PA and state exacerbated.",https://doi.org/10.3389/FSOC.2023.1140416,article

However, this is faced with the challenge of a global digital divide in the use of these devices between generations. Even though the younger generation easily uses digital technology, the older generation generally does not understand technology. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to cell phone and mobile application utilization among Indonesian urban older adults in relation to the use of mobile health applications. Method: This was a cross-sectional study on community-dwelling older adult individuals aged 60 years or older in Jakarta, Indonesia, between August and November 2020. Results: Overall, 95 out of the 109 older adults (87.16%) had used cell phones during the past month. In practice, we found that 53% of older adults used cell phones to browse online health information; however, the percentage of health application users was still low (16%). The main problem these individuals faced when using cell phones was difficulties related to learning to use mobile apps (51%). Only a small number of older adults (19%) learn how to use cell phones by themselves. There was a significant association between the level of education and the need for assistance from others in using cell phones (p=0.005), between the method employed to learn how to use a cell phone and sex (p=0.043) and age (p=0.036). Conclusion: Indonesian urban older adults have tended to start embracing digital life. Family members play an important role in teaching technology skills to older adults. In addition, the higher the education level of an older adult subject, the more independent he or she was in using a cell phone. Method on how to use a cell phone by self-learning was associated with male sex and younger age (<75 years old).

We illustrate the pertinence and nuances of this particular risk through lived experience research in a UK public library where limited users receive help with digital skills. Although there is a growing recognition of both the inevitability of digital welfare and the risks to marginalised communities, little work has been done to connect these abstract policy discussions to lived experience—to pinpoint how digitisation creates these exclusions, beyond simply having internet access or not. This article argues that the prerequisite of a digital footprint engenders a double disadvantage: (1) lacking a digital footprint is the result of barriers that are largely invisible to data-driven, digital-by-default systems, and (2) when marginalised users establish a sufficient footprint, this entails a disproportionately onerous responsibility for managing a distributed personal data trail in the long term. This combination of mundane barriers and the burden of responsibility for a digital identity points to policy implications for governments aiming to advance inclusive digital transformation agendas.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1758-5899.13140,article

This paper presents a theory of the co-evolution of technology, organizational networks, and institutional arrangements in the transformation of government. The theory uses the grammars of system dynamics and builds upon institutional approaches to understand interactions among all these variables in the development of information and communication technologies in government.

Second, this triple-crown of public policy is highly effective for longitudinal effect when implemented early via educational institutions. Third, ruralurban digital inequality is resistant to change such that rural populations benefit less from policy initiatives than their urban counterparts. Fourth, digital inclusion in rural areas and among marginalized populations is most effective when cocreated with communities to ensure community investment, participation, and control.

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses binomial logistic regression modeling on two data sets: a nationwide survey at the individual level of 8,854 usable samples conducted in 2019 and village potential statistics. Findings: The survey indicates low adoption and use of e-government services among both males and females. The statistical analysis further reveals that although there might be some variations in the influencing factors between the genders, the overall patterns are similar. These findings suggest that the low adoption and use of e-government services among males and females can be attributed to factors such as misperceptions about internet-based services, resulting in low motivation to use the services, inadequate internet connectivity, affordability, limited digital skills and exposure to harmful online content.

By relying on a face-to-face national representative survey, the results showed that smartphones represent an opportunity to access the internet for those who traditionally lag behind. However mobile-only use does not necessarily lead to a more complete digital inclusion process because it was related to lower levels of skills and less diverse types of uses of the web compared to those people who also use the computer.

"Heeks, Richard",2022.0,{Digital inequality beyond the digital divide: conceptualizing adverse digital incorporation in the global South,"Digital systems are significantly associated with inequality in the global South. That association has traditionally been understood in terms of the digital divide or related terminologies whose core conceptualization is the exclusion of some groups from the benefits of digital systems. However, with the growing breadth and depth of digital engagement in the global South, an exclusion worldview is no longer sufficient. What is also needed is an understanding of how inequalities are created for some groups that are included in digital systems. This paper creates such an understanding, drawing from ideas in the development studies literature on chronic poverty to inductively build a model of a new concept: ‘adverse digital incorporation', meaning inclusion in a digital system that enables a more-advantaged group to extract disproportionate value from the work or resources of another, less-advantaged group. This new model will enable those involved with digital development to understand why, how and for whom inequality can emerge from the growing use of digital systems in the global South. It creates a systematic framework incorporating the processes, the drivers, and the causes of adverse digital incorporation that will provide detailed new insights. The paper concludes with implications for both digital development researchers and practitioners that derive from the model and its exposure to the broader components of power that shape the inclusionary connection between digital and inequality.",https://doi.org/10.1080/02681102.2022.2068492,article

This paved the way for digital inclusion, particularly through e-commerce and shared services platforms which helped to reduce barriers to entry and created abundant socio-economic opportunities across income groups. As a result, digital literacy becomes a vital aspect of modern life due to the rapid global shift toward this digital transformation. Numerous scholars have investigated the benefits of digital literacies since 1995. The primary objective of this paper is to investigate good practices and lessons learned on how digital literacy may serve as a policy instrument for social innovation and socio-economic transformations. The empirical approach is interpretive, through an understanding of digital literacy categorized into three primary pillars: (i) the evolution and foundational concepts of digital literacy, (ii) frameworks and measures of digital literacy, and (iii) the capacity and skills associated with digital literacy. The paper also examines how digital literacy capacity and skills shape social innovation initiatives in Singapore and the UAE, impacting the socio-economic transformation of individuals, families, and communities. Our interpretive approach from field observations and policy implementation, offers a multi-dimensional perspective on digital literacy research, and its socio-economic impact on people and communities. These insights can assist researchers new to this field to gain a more thorough understanding of digital literacy's broad ecosystem and its extensive impact on communities and nations as a key driver of socio-economic change.",https://doi.org/10.54517/ssd.v1i1.2167,article

Most approaches have been technology-centric with an inherent assumption of cultural and political neutrality of new media technologies. There are multiple hurdles in every stage of digital literacy implementation. The lack of solutions such as local language digital interfaces, locally relevant content, digital literacy training, the use of icons and audio excludes a large fraction of illiterate people. In this article, we analyse case studies targeted at under-connected people in sub-Saharan Africa and India that use digital literacy programmes to build knowledge and health literacy, solve societal problems and foster development. In India, we focus on notable initiatives undertaken in the domain of digital literacy for rural populations. In Sub-Saharan Africa, we draw from an original project in Kenya aiming at developing digital literacy for youth from low-income backgrounds. We further focus on Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso and Tanzania, where field studies have been conducted on the use of digital technologies by low-literacy people and on how audio and icon-based interfaces and Internet lite standard could help them overcome their limitations. The main objective of this article is to identify key performance indicators (KPIs) in the context of digital literacy skills as one of the pillars for digital inclusion.

This emerging human attribute is known as digital literacy. Today, digital literacy is an essential component of everyone's personal and professional lives to survive and thrive in the digital world. The notion of advocating digital literacy around the world is leveraged on the shoulders of higher education institutes. The institutes are playing a pivotal role in mentoring the younger generation to be digitally literate so that they can contribute effectively towards an individual, societal and national development and progression. This same now applies to the South Pacific region as well, with its recent progressive growth of ICT and the dynamic use of digital technology. It can also be added that digital literacy and, by extension, digital fluency is more needed in developing countries, including the South Pacific region, as these countries rely heavily on ICTs for their economic survival, competition and progression. However, there is a dearth of baseline research on digital literacy in the South Pacific since the concept is still new and an emerging one in the region. A few works have been done on the components of digital literacy highlighted in this integrative literature review paper.

However, this potential remains largely unrecognized and poorly understood in disaster risk management. This study explores current achievements, existing challenges, and the untapped potential of DT in disaster risk management, and accordingly, proposes an improved Digital twin-based post-disaster risk management framework. This paper employs a systematic literature review approach focusing on digital post-disaster risk management twinning (DPRMT) and smart early warning systems derived from two databases: Scopus and Web of Science. After a screening process with exclusion criteria, the final analysis synthesizes findings from a selected set of 96 papers. The results revealed that previous studies are not beyond only providing general statements about DT. There is a need for diverse data collection methods, considering demographic and financial aspects, understanding social dynamics, employing dynamic models, recognizing interconnected systems, and giving due attention to the often-neglected recovery phase. This study proposes a comprehensive DPRMT concept framework leveraging decision-makers with a holistic and efficient approach that offers real-time, detailed, and data-driven modeling solutions to achieve insights into disaster-affected areas and communities.

It also opens new horizons for information systems research. We analyse how ongoing pervasive digitization of product innovation reshapes knowledge creation and sharing in innovation networks. We argue that advances in digital technologies (1) increase innovation network connectivity by reducing communication costs and increasing its reach and scope and (2) increase the speed and scope of digital convergence, which increases network knowledge heterogeneity and need for integration. These developments, in turn, stretch existing innovation networks by redistributing control and increasing the demand for knowledge coordination across time and space presenting novel challenges for knowledge creation, assimilation and integration. Based on this foundation, we distinguish four types of emerging innovation networks supported by digitalization: (1) project innovation networks; (2) clan innovation networks; (3) federated innovation networks; and (4) anarchic innovation networks. Each network involves different cognitive and social translations - or ways of identifying, sharing and assimilating knowledge. We describe the role of five novel properties of digital infrastructures in supporting each type of innovation network: representational flexibility, semantic coherence, temporal and spatial traceability, knowledge brokering and linguistic calibration. We identify several implications for future innovation research. In particular, we focus on the emergence of anarchic network forms that follow full-fledged digital convergence founded on richer innovation ontologies and epistemologies calling to critically re-examine the nature and impact of modularization for innovation.",https://doi.org/10.1111/ISJ.12093,article

Recent developments in the concept of smart city have led to a renewed interest in Digital Twin. Using precise Building Information Modelling (BIM) consolidated with big data and sensors, several attempts have been made to establish digital twin smart cities. In recent years, several researchers have sought to determine the capability of smart city and digital twin for various taxonomies such as development and urban planning purposes, built environment, manufacturing, environmental, disaster management, and healthcare. Despite being beneficial in many disciplines, especially in manufacturing, built environment, and urban planning, these existing studies have shown a lack of aspect in terms of emergency or disaster-related as opposed to the elements mentioned above. This is because the researcher has not treated emergencies or disasters in much detail. Therefore, an extensive review on smart city, digital twin, BIM and disaster management and technology that revolves around these terms were summarised. In general, 39 articles from prominent multidisciplinary databases were retrieved over the last two decades based on the suggested PRISMA workflow. These final articles were analysed and categorised into four themes based on the research content, gist, and keywords. Based on the review of 39 articles related to smart city, digital twin and BIM, a workflow for the smart city digital twin and the conceptual framework for indoor disaster management was proposed accordingly.

Many studies have applied intelligence technologies to solve key aspects of infrastructure, such as design, construction, disaster prevention and mitigation, and rescue and recovery; however, systematic construction is still lacking. Digital twin (DT) is one of the most promising technologies for multi-stage management which has great potential to solve the above challenges. This paper initially puts forward a scientific concept, in which DT drives the construction of intelligent disaster prevention and mitigation for infrastructure (IDPMI) systematically. To begin with, a scientific review of DT and IDPMI is performed, where the development of DT is summarized and a DT-based life cycle of infrastructures is defined. In addition, the intelligence technologies used in disaster management are key reviewed and their relative merits are illustrated. Furthermore, the development and technical feasibility of DT-driven IDPMI are illustrated by reviewing the relevant practice of DT in infrastructure. In conclusion, a scientific framework of DT-IDPMI is programmed, which not only provides some guidance for the deep integration between DT and IDPMI but also identifies the challenges that inspire the professional community to advance these techniques to address them in future research.",https://doi.org/10.1007/S11069-021-05190-X,article

AI and ML in particular are widely used in animal husbandry to monitor both the animals and environment around the clock, which leads to a better understanding of animal behavior and distress, disease control and prevention, and effective business decisions for the farmer. One particularly promising area that advances upon AI is digital twin technology, which is currently used to improve efficiencies and reduce costs across multiple industries and sectors. In contrast to a model, a digital twin is a digital replica of a real-world entity that is kept current with a constant influx of data. The application of digital twins within the livestock farming sector is the next frontier and has the potential to be used to improve large-scale precision livestock farming practices, machinery and equipment usage, and the health and well-being of a wide variety of farm animals. The mental and emotional states of animals can be monitored using recognition technology that examines facial features, such as ear postures and eye white regions. Used with modeling, simulation and augmented reality technologies, digital twins can help farmers to build more energy-efficient housing structures, predict heat cycles for breeding, discourage negative behaviors of livestock, and potentially much more. As with all disruptive technological advances, the implementation of digital twin technology will demand a thorough cost and benefit analysis of individual farms.

Design/methodology/approach: We searched academic and grey literature to identify relevant papers. From 8464 academic articles and 183 grey literature, after two levels of screening, 31 articles and 54 documents were selected, respectively. A thematic analysis was conducted following the steps suggested by Braun and Clarke and results were reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Findings: The results showed that most articles and papers were either from Europe or North America. Studies used a range of research methods, including quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods. The results demonstrated four major dimensions of the digital divide among various vulnerable groups, including digital literacy, affordability, equity-deserving group-sensitive content and availability or access to infrastructure. Among vulnerable groups, low-income people were reported in the majority of the studies followed by older adults, racial and ethnic minorities, newcomers/new immigrants and refugees, Indigenous groups, people with disabilities and women. Most reported barriers included lack of access to the internet, digital skills, language barriers and internet costs. Originality/value: To the best of our knowledge, there have been limited attempts to thoroughly review the literature to better understand the emerging dimensions of digital equity and the digital divide, identifying major vulnerable populations and their unique barriers and challenges.

The 1990 Global Burden of Disease study proposed disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to measure disease burden. No comprehensive update of disease burden worldwide incorporating a systematic reassessment of disease and injury-specific epidemiology has been done since the 1990 study. We aimed to calculate disease burden worldwide and for 21 regions for 1990, 2005, and 2010 with methods to enable meaningful comparisons over time. Methods: We calculated DALYs as the sum of years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs). DALYs were calculated for 291 causes, 20 age groups, both sexes, and for 187 countries, and aggregated to regional and global estimates of disease burden for three points in time with strictly comparable definitions and methods. YLLs were calculated from age-sex-country-time-specific estimates of mortality by cause, with death by standardised lost life expectancy at each age. YLDs were calculated as prevalence of 1160 disabling sequelae, by age, sex, and cause, and weighted by new disability weights for each health state. Neither YLLs nor YLDs were age-weighted or discounted.

However, it has evolved extensively both etymologically and conceptually in time and across scientific disciplines. The concept has been (re)shaped by the evolution of research and practice efforts. Considered the opposite of vulnerability for a long time, resilience was first defined as the ability to resist, bounce back, cope with, and recover quickly from the impacts of hazards. To avoid the possible return to conditions of vulnerability and exposure to hazards, the notions of post-disaster development, transformation, and adaptation (build back better) and anticipation, innovation, and proactivity (bounce forward) were then integrated. Today, resilience is characterized by a multitude of components and several classifications. We present a selection of 25 components used to define resilience, and an interesting linkage emerges between these components and the dimensions of risk management (prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery), offering a perspective to strengthen resilience through the development of capacities. Despite its potential, resilience is subject to challenges regarding its operationalization, effectiveness, measurement, credibility, equity, and even its nature. Nevertheless, it offers applicability and opportunities for local communities as well as an interdisciplinary look at global challenges.",https://doi.org/10.1007/S13753-022-00419-0,article

While mobile payment is already the dominant payment type in Asia, it is still in its infancy in Europe despite a high mobile phone penetration rate and service providers' considerable investments in the technology. Mobile payment is therefore a recent example of the puzzle of abundance—a phenomenon describing a situation in which the potential of a new disruptive technology is not tapped by the masses even though it offers substantial benefits to them. In this study, we address this puzzle by investigating the factors influencing the intention to use a disruptive technology. We draw on the example of mobile payment and develop and test a refined technology acceptance model. Results indicate that the intention to use mobile payment services is positively affected by perceived usefulness, perceived compatibility, perceived personal innovativeness, and perceived social influence, but is negatively affected by perceived risk. Both perceived costs and perceived risk mitigate the positive impact of several other characteristics.

As such, managing huge collected readings in this domain posted many challenges due to its design limitations. In order to provide seamless data transmission, which is of utmost importance in those delay-sensitive applications, minimum delay and packet loss occurrence should be considered. Specifically, this paper addresses the common issue of congested networks in WSN with the combination technique of variance-based distributed contention control (DCC-V) and packet size optimization. The proposed integration technique, which operates on medium access control layer, takes into consideration the packet size advantages as it plays a key role in determining successful data delivery, given the error-prone nature of WSN. While ensuring fewer corrupted packets, the proposed contention window (CW) in DCC-V minimizes the chances of packet collisions and so alleviates congestion. In this technique, CW is determined based on slot utilization and average collision values, which also involve standard deviation measurements.

{Hadi Amini,2019.0,{Distributed holistic framework for smart city infrastructures: Tale of interdependent electrified transportation network and power grid,"Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) play a pivotal role in transportation electrification. The flexible nature of PEVs' charging demand can be utilized for reducing charging cost as well as optimizing the operating cost of power and transportation networks. Utilizing charging flexibility of geographically spread PEVs requires design and implementation of efficient optimization algorithms. There is a synergy between electro mobility (e-Mobility) infrastructures (including charging stations) and PEVs. In this paper, we introduce a holistic framework to model interdependent nature of power systems and electrified transportation networks, enhance the operational performance of these systems as a network-of-networks, and explain the required information exchange via coupling agents (e.g., PEVs and charging stations). We develop a holistic framework that enables distributed coordination of interdependent networks through the IoT lens. To this end, we propose to use a fully distributed consensus+innovations approach. This iterative algorithm achieves a distributed solution of the decision making for each agent through local computations and limited communication with other neighboring agents that are influential in that specific decision. For instance, the optimal routing decision of a PEV involves a different set of agents as compared with the optimal charging strategy of the same PEV. The exogenous information from an external network/agent can affect internal operation of the other agents. For instance, having some information about traffic congestion at the transportation networks changes the decision of PEVs to charge their battery at another location. Our approach constitutes solving an iterative problem, which utilizes communication at the smart city layer, as a network of infrastructures, including power grid and electrified transportation network, that enables fully distributed coordination of agents. Fully distributed decision making enables scalability of the solution and plug-and-play capability, as well as increasing the information privacy of PEVs by only requiring limited local information exchange with neighboring agents. We investigate a detailed application of our framework for interdependent power systems and electrified transportation networks. To this end, we first identify the functionalities, constraints, objectives, and decision variables of each network. Then, we investigate the interdependent interactions among these networks and their corresponding agents.",https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2950372,article

In this study, a distributed proxy cache management platform based on autonomous decision is proposed. The platform realizes highly efficient automatic cache management by taking the advantages of autonomous perception and decision. First, the platform establishes the autonomous management framework of proxy cache on the basis of the idea of feedback loop. Next, the URL is distributed evenly among cache nodes through the hash ring storage mechanism with virtual nodes. Cache status adjustment strategies are made based on historical status sequences and the gray prediction model. A method that is used to predict content hot-rank based on domain name set is proposed to reduce loads of cache nodes. Second, the platform designs a distributed proxy cache management system by depending on the autonomous management framework of proxy cache and the cache management mechanism of autonomous decision, and the Cache Hot Spots Migrate algorithm is suggested for the dynamic migration and integration of virtual nodes on the hash ring. A system knowledge base is established through status sequence and corresponding adjustment strategies. Finally, experimental results on the hash ring, content hot-rank prediction, and adjustment of autonomous decision of cache status are analyzed, thereby confirming that the distributed proxy cache management mechanism based on autonomous decision could manage cache nodes effectively and automatically, and could improve the overall performance of the system.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.FUTURE.2016.03.015,article

An important issue arising is the new challenge required for researchers to capture, manage, and analyse data that highlight the unique character of practices around texts in digital environments. Such inquiries, we argue, require multiple elements of data to be captured and analysed as part of effective literacy ethnographies. These include such things as the unfolding of digital texts, the activities around them, and features of the surrounding social and material environment. This paper addresses these methodological issues drawing from three educationally focused studies, and reporting their experiences and insights within uniquely different contexts. We deal with the issue of adopting new digital methods for literacy research through the notion of a ‘deep dive' to explore educational tasks in classrooms. Through a discussion of how we approached the capture and analysis of our data, we present methods to better understand digital literacies in education. We then outline challenges posed by our methods, how they can be used more broadly for researching interaction in digital environments, and how they augment transdisciplinary debates and trends in research methods.",https://doi.org/10.1080/09500782.2015.1041972,article

A case study in Indonesia,"Environmental mobility (residential moves influenced by environmental factors) is increasingly recognized as an important issue, both today and under future conditions of climate change. Those who experience climate-and weather-related disasters rarely respond as a homogenous group of migrants, yet relatively limited studies have specifically examined individual-level heterogeneities across those exposed. In this paper, we used self-reported data to investigate differences in sociodemographics (age, marital status, sex, and education) between those who relocated after environmental disruptions in Indonesia and those who did not relocate. Individuals with 12 years of education at the time of an environmental exposure were 3.93 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.38, 11.20) times more likely to move for environmental reasons than those with <12 years of education. Assuming education as a proxy for socioeconomic status, these findings suggest that those in the mid-range socioeconomic brackets may be most likely to migrate after environmental disruptions, while the poorest are less likely to move. This may reflect that the costs of relocation are prohibitively high for those with lower socioeconomic status.

It also discusses the social and digital differences that such policies may generate, with a particular focus on the potential for exacerbating urban inequalities. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve this, the study employs a principal component analysis (PCA) to develop an ICT development indicator system. It then employs a difference-in-differences (DID) model to analyze panel data from 209 Chinese cities over the period from 2007 to 2019, examining the impact of SC policies on ICT development across various urban settings. Findings: Our findings show that SC policies have significantly contributed to the enhancement of ICT development, especially in ICT usage. However, SC policies may inadvertently reinforce developmental disparities among cities. Compared to less developed areas, the benefits of SC policies are more pronounced in economically booming cities. This is likely due to the agglomeration of the ICT industry and the strong allure of developed urban centers for high-caliber talent. Originality/value: This study contributes to the related literature by explaining the role of SC policies in driving ICT development and by focusing on the often-overlooked impact of SC policies on urban inequality.

The authors posit an exploratory model: The first part of the model shows how adoption of municipal e-government is determined by managerial innovativeness orientation, government capacity and institutional characteristics such as city size and government type. The second part suggests how e-government outcomes are associated with the adoption of e-government, government capacity and institutional characteristics. Analysing two different survey data sets of American municipal reinvention and e-government, this study finds that managerial innovativeness orientation and city size are the most compelling determinants of municipal e-government adoption.

A comparative analysis of undergraduates' beliefs and behaviors related to conventional and digital cheating,"This study provides a comparative analysis of students' self-reported beliefs and behaviors related to six analogous pairs of conventional and digital forms of academic cheating. Results from an online survey of undergraduates at two universities (N = 1,305) suggest that students use conventional means more often than digital means to copy homework, collaborate when it is not permitted, and copy from others during an exam. However, engagement in digital plagiarism (cutting and pasting from the Internet) has surpassed conventional plagiarism. Students also reported using digital ""cheat sheets"" (i.e., notes stored in a digital device) to cheat on tests more often than conventional ""cheat sheets."" Overall, 32% of students reported no cheating of any kind, 18.2% reported using only conventional methods, 4.2% reported using only digital methods, and 45.6% reported using both conventional and digital methods to cheat. ""Digital only"" cheaters were less likely than ""conventional only"" cheaters to report assignment cheating, but the former was more likely than the latter to report engagement in plagiarism. Students who cheated both conventionally and digitally were significantly different from the other three groups in terms of their self-reported engagement in all three types of cheating behavior. Students in this ""both"" group also had the lowest sense of moral responsibility to refrain from cheating and the greatest tendency to neutralize that responsibility. The scientific and educational implications of these findings are discussed in this study. Copyright {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1080/10508420701519197,article

The case of smart devices*,"From the government's perspective, it is important to understand the factors that influence effective utilization of new service channels, particularly the use of smart devices. Furthermore, how the utilization of a new channel affects trust in the government is an important performance factor whose linkage mechanism also needs to be investigated. This study collected 417 questionnaires from Korean citizens who communicate with the government via smart devices; the questionnaires were analyzed using structural equation analysis. This research indicates that in order to maximize trust in government, service delivery via smart devices must be designed with a clear understanding of the three significant components of such communication, namely the service, channel, and citizens. The service selected must be appropriate to the characteristics of the channel, and service reform may be necessary, beyond using the channel simply as a service means. Citizens' ability to utilize the channel must also be fully considered. In order to increase the efficacy of new channel utilization, fast implementation is less important than understanding how to satisfy citizens' needs regarding use of the public service via a smart device.",https://doi.org/10.1080/02681102.2017.1412291,article

This paper aims at disclosing the driving elements that make a city smarter, based on the literature, interviews with experts, and insights from smart cities projects (Amsterdam, Barcelona, Lisbon, Vienna). Results show that a smart city is an urban innovation ecosystem where knowledge easily flows from a deliberated interaction and collaboration among different stakeholders to create wealth, supported by a flexible institutional structure, an integrated-participative governance model, a digital-green infrastructure and a functional urban design with diversified amenities and facilities.

With the development of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, dynamic data update provides the scope of distribution schedule to adopt changes with updates. Therefore, the dynamic relief items distribution schedule becomes a need to generate humanitarian supply chain schedules as a smart city application. To address the disaster data updates in different time periods, a dynamic optimised model with a sliding time window is proposed that defines the distribution schedule of relief items from multiple supply points to different disaster regions. The proposed model not only considers the details of available resources dynamically but also introduces disaster region priority along with transportation routes information updates for each scheduling time slot. Such an integrated optimised model delivers an effective distribution schedule to start with and updates it for each time slot. A set of numerical case studies is formulated to evaluate the performance of the optimised scheduling. The dynamic updates on the relief item demands' travel path, causality level and available resources parameters have been included as performance measures for optimising the distributing schedule. The models have been evaluated based on performance measures to reflect disaster scenarios. Evaluation of the proposed models in comparison to the other perspective static and dynamic relief items distribution models shows that adopting dynamic updates in the distribution model cover most of the major aspects of the relief items distribution task in a more realistic way for post-disaster relief management. The analysis has also shown that the proposed model has the adaptability to address the changing demand and resources availability along with disaster conditions. In addition, this model will also help the decision-makers to plan the post-disaster relief operations in more effective ways by covering the updates on disaster data in each time period.",https://doi.org/10.3390/APP12168358,article

Orchestrating emerging innovation ecosystems can offer a path to sustained competitive advantage for ecosystem leaders. Yet, it calls for the development of new capabilities to sense, seize, and reconfigure digitalization opportunities in a highly dynamic ecosystem environment. Yet, prior research lacks insights into the dynamic capabilities and routines required for ecosystem innovation. Therefore, this study investigates how firms can develop dynamic capabilities to orchestrate ecosystem innovation and, thus, gain from it. Through a multiple case study of smart city initiatives, we offer insights into the specific micro-foundations or sub-routines underlying the ecosystem leader's sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring capabilities, which are necessary to orchestrate ecosystem innovation.

Research studies have shown that the smart city system primarily focuses on integrating three components: economic, environmental, and social. The social component includes participatory democracy with citizen engagement. In many cases, smart cities focus on discovering answers for various urban problems through the adoption of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) designed to collect citizen feedback, or provide knowledge resources that can improve the quality of urban life. However, there are very few studies that attempt to close the information loop and link problems to solutions in one, unified framework. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate such a unified approach. Using the theoretical lens of dynamic capabilities, we expand the definition of a smart city to include the notion of an urban organization with dynamic capabilities, which operates within cycles of 'sense', 'seize', ‘align', and ‘transform' functions. Our case study focuses on the 'sense' and 'seize' steps, describing a medium-size city in Texas, where an open-ended survey is used as a collection instrument for citizen input and concept-based analytics are employed to convert such input into actionable insights.

According to the study findings, control of corruption, regulatory quality, and citizen participation demonstrate short-run effects on Government Effectiveness. The combination of quick expansions in the rule of law regulations and previous government efficiency creates obstacles to present-day administrative success, indicating potential administrative flexibility problems. Sustainable improvements in government effectiveness emerge from robust control of corruption combined with high regulatory quality, active voice, and accountability during the long-run analysis. Combining e-government platforms with strict regulations shows inverse relationships to sustainable effectiveness because proper institutional backing and supplementary reform measures are essential for digital tools to produce intended benefits.

This article aims to study the relationship between the E-Government Development Index (EGDI) and ESG factors in 26 European countries. The linear ordering method TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) was used for the study, followed by the Perkal index and the method of optimal predictors' selection—the Hellwig method. The study is based on the Eurostat data (in the period 2003–2020), and the analysis includes ten variables: Share of environmental taxes in GDP; Exposure to dust air pollution; Greenhouse gas emissions by source sector—carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, etc. (energy, industry, agriculture, forestry, waste management) (thousands of tonnes); Passenger transport volume in relation to GDP; At risk of poverty or social exclusion; Percentage of people satisfied with their financial situation among people aged 16+; Share of the ICT sector in GDP; Unemployment rate of people aged 20–64; Research and development expenditure in all sectors; GDP per capita. The in-depth analysis offers a matrix that represents the relationships between environmental taxes and the development of e-government. The main finding reveals statistically significant relationships between the EGDI and aggregate variables representing the environmental, social and economic spheres. It indicates a genuine, positive impact of digitalised administrative processes on sustainable development. It also seems to confirm that investments in digital infrastructure and government e-services bring multiple long-term benefits and contribute directly to all three domains relevant to the sustainability of modern development.

Second, it highlights the effect of good governance on sustainable development, and third, it assesses the effect of e-government development on sustainable development, i.e., the digital dividends. The race is between skills and technology, while the outcome will settle on whether the dividends from digital technologies are realized and the benefits widely shared. The results reveal that most indicators of good governance have a positive contribution to sustainable development. As for the impact of e-government development on governance indicators, findings show that digitalization improves control of corruption and government effectiveness, and to a lesser extent, regulatory quality. Contrary to what was expected, e-government-related variables exert an adverse effect on various aspects of sustainable development instead of being a catalyst for progress. Based on these findings, the paper provides some recommendations. Essentially, policies on the use of digital technologies need to be adequately embedded in public sector reform.

Although E-Government is a global phenomenon, simply transferring ICT solutions and related organizational concepts from developed to developing countries seems inappropriate. E-Government undoubtedly has the potential to reduce administrative and development problems. However, it is obvious that compared to developed countries, additional effort is necessary when implementing E-Government in developing countries. More than in developed countries, the different initial institutional, cultural, and wider administrative contexts must be considered to avoid unintended effects. It is oversimplifying the issue to merely state that E-Government projects fail in Africa and other developing regions. Although E-Government in African countries lags far behind developed countries, this should be considered more as a state failure or lack of capacity in general. In particular, the different administrative contexts and rationalities must be taken into an account when implementing E-Government projects and strategies. Therefore, especially for African countries, a context-oriented approach seems to be a more promising route to the successful implementation of E-Government.

The author suggests that the essence of the problem of e-democracy is in its internal contradictions: a) the convergence of the concept with other theories of democracy; b) ethical issues of the ICT exploitation within the political sphere. The former includes the combination in a single construction of fundamental features of both direct, deliberative and representative democracy in a single construction; substitution of the principles of direct democracy by the principles of plebiscite democracy; multidirectional aspirations expressed in involvement with the simultaneously existing internal apathy to the political sphere. Ethical contradictions: maximizing transparency with high manipulability; independence of decisions with controversial anonymity; reducing bureaucratic procedures as fraud acts increase; reduced number of absentists with persisting distrust of the system. Also, the methods of e-democracy within one society can create premises for both digital authoritarization and the strengthening of the role of civil society.",https://doi.org/10.22363/2312-8313-2022-9-3-275-283,article

It focuses on the long-term development of the European Union following the spillover effect described by Neofunctionalism integration theory. Therefore, it explores the potential of e-government fostering the European integration to a new level thanks to the new digital possibilities. New information and communication technologies can make a significant contribution to the achievement of good governance goals. This EU “e-governance” can make public management more efficient and more effective and attract the loyalty of the participants to the European project. This research outlines the main contributions of e-governance in Europe: improving government processes (e-administration); connecting citizens (e-citizens and e-services); and building external interactions (e-society). Case studies are used to show that e-governance is a current, not just future, reality for developing countries and the European Union. E-governance requires a concrete roadmap for its development and this chapter focuses on the main steps required to implement an effective e-governance within the European Union.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iot.2024.101321,article

Fixing problems and framing stories are presented as the two principal strategies for tackling the various barriers throughout the innovation process. This model is explored in a case study of a technological system for collaboration between police and citizens in The Netherlands. The case shows the value of the model and highlights that e-governance innovation is about designing comprehensive strategies of fixing and framing to tackle the variety of barriers.

Many governments around the globe are investing heavily in IT to enhance service delivery to their citizens. However, citizens do not always use these services so that they often forgo their potential benefits because of key interconnected considerations that are perceived to transpire from their use. Over the years several studies examined IT adoption in e-government services contexts, building a rich albeit fragmented body of knowledge in the process. Indeed, the diversity found in these studies and the fast and continuous change that characterizes IT in general, make the identification and the synthesis of the main factors influencing citizens' adoption of E-government services a relevant and timely endeavor.

The study will help IT practitioners in the public sector learn how to use and manage information technologies to revitalise business processes, improve decision-making, and gain a competitive advantage from the adoption of e-government. The proposed architecture framework for e-government adoption will reduce confusion surrounding e-government infrastructure in the public sector through understanding the implementation processes, identifying requirements of information and communications technology tools, highlighting the importance of the organisational management resources and the impact of barriers. Design/methodology/approach - A range of earlier studies have been critically examined and analysed to provide an integrated architecture framework for e-government adoption that can address and identify the standards, infrastructure components, applications, and technologies for e-government. The authors have divided the architecture framework into four layers; access layer, e-government layer, e-business layer, and infrastructure layer; each layer addresses a particular aspect of e-government architecture. This paper then presents a critical analysis of barriers experienced in public sector organisations, which prevent the successful adoption of e-government; such barriers being presented in a taxonomy. Findings - Defined organisational and technological requirements that will be necessary for the adoption of e-government in public sector organisations through construct an integrated architecture framework for e-government. The difficulties and barriers that have been experienced in public sector organisations which complicate the implementation process of e-government have been analysed and then identified and presented in a taxonomy. Originality/value - The paper provides architecture framework for e-government adoption that can help to guide IT managers recognise the technological and organisational requirements for e-government adoption in public sector organisations. The framework can also help the decision makers to set a vision statement and strategic action plan for future direction in the information technology age through identifying key elements and stages for action. The authors also identify and classify the perceived barriers that might complicate the implementation process of e-government projects. The awareness of these barriers is important for any e-government project since they will alert the e-government project team with any problems or challenges might be existed during the implementation process so they will be ready to overcome them. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1108/14637150510619902,article

Design/methodology/ approach - The authors wrote a questionnaire that was sent to the regions and the largest cities of EU countries, in order to find out their degree of involvement in e-government initiatives. Responses were received from 47 regional and local governments. Findings - At present, most regional and local governments have a web site, although in most cases it is little more than a governmental billboard. E-government is not likely to remodel governance in the short term, since democracy initiatives are not on the present agenda of most EU countries. The survey findings show that e-government initiatives are still predominantly non-interactive and non-deliberative. They tend to reflect present service delivery patterns, not transform them. Research limitations/ implications - The construction and management of web sites is becoming an essential element of modern public administration, but little is known about how these initiatives are being implemented. Given the substantial investment in time and other resources for governmental online initiatives, it is essential to begin to evaluate governmental web site initiatives in terms of quality and effectiveness. Originality/value - This work is of value as, to date, there are very few studies that benchmark local government web sites across the EU. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1108/14684520510628918,article

The complexity of evaluation is mostly due to the multiple perspectives involved, the difficulties of quantifying benefits, and the social and technical context of use. The importance of e-government evaluation is due to the enormous investment put in by governments for delivering e-government services and to the considerable pace of growing in the e-government field. However, despite the importance of the evaluation of e-government services, the literature shows that e-government evaluation is still an immature area in terms of development and management.

The main aim of this article is to develop evaluation criteria for an effective, adaptable, and reflective assessment of e-government systems from the citizen's perspective. Developing countries suffer from poor citizen utilization of their e-government initiatives, and the adoption of such criteria would positively contribute in enhancing government understanding of the factors that influence citizen utilization of e-government systems.

Alongwith these limitations, we found that the e-government maturity models adopted by developing countries are failing to provide an appropriate strategic plan to deploy sustainable e-government services. While assessing the existing e-government maturity model, we made several observations on the lack of detail, the technology-centric nature, the emphasis on implementation, and the lack of an adoption strategy. This work contributes toward the proposition of a new e-governmentmaturitymodel that would address the limitations of exiting e-governmentmaturity models, and would support governments in developing countries to achieve sustainable e-government services.

Based on the analysis of the municipal information and interaction indexes, our results show that municipalities are increasingly committed to developing online initiatives for citizen participation in a significant way over the years, with the largest municipalities being the ones that implement the most mechanisms. The influence of population size occurs both for information dissemination and for the implementation of citizen participation mechanisms. This result is consistent with stakeholder theory and political cost theory.

"Pedersen, Keld",2018.0,{E-government transformations: challenges and strategies,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate how to analyse the possibilities for e-government transformations in public sector organisations and how these possibilities can be improved. Design/methodology/approach: The research constructs a model based on a literature review that focusses on the pressure that drives transformations, on the challenges transformations face and on the abilities needed for overcoming these challenges. The resulting model is subsequently used to analyse a successful case and to identify the keys to success in terms of the strategies used to transform. Findings: The possibilities for transformation depend on the organisational and contextual configuration (a public sector organisation and the context it operates in) which is more or less supportive of transformations. The configuration can be characterized by the pressure to transform, the challenges that must be overcome and the abilities to do so. There are some basic conditions that impact the possibilities for making the configuration more supportive of transformations: the interest of powerful stakeholders, the degree of publicness, the possibilities for changing the configuration are path dependent and the factors that matter for the possibilities for transformation are interrelated and might be governed by different authorities which make it difficult to manage and change them. When improving the possibilities for transformation in a configuration, the pressure can be increased, transformations can be made easier to accomplish by reducing challenges and by providing more support and abilities might be developed to better overcome the challenges. Transformation is accomplished through an interplay between actions that improve and exploit the configuration. Research limitations/implications: The findings are based on a single case. Practical implications: The public sector should find the balance between making transformations easier and increasing capabilities. The lessons from this research suggest that a more balanced strategy focussing more on eliminating the contextual and organisational challenges that make these projects so complex and providing more support might be a better investment than just aiming to increase project level capabilities. Social implications: Just as practice might benefit from changing the balance between increasing project level capabilities and making transformation easier, e-government research might improve its relevance by changing the balance between suggesting new approaches and researching the basic conditions for the exploitation of IT in public sector organisations. While the essence of public sector organisations in some cases makes transformations very challenging, there are still factors that might be improved upon through research.

The global healthcare smart wearable healthcare (SWH) devices market is expected to rise up at a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 5.6% and by 2020 it is expected to reach 25 Billion (GVR Report, 2016). The growing incidences of lifestyle diseases, sedentary lifestyle, busy work schedules, technological advancements in healthcare monitoring devices, and increased usage of remote devicesseems to be some of the important factors fuelling this growth. Some of the major players in this segment are Abbott Laboratories, Philips Healthcare, Life Watch, GE Healthcare, Omron Healthcare, Siemens Healthcare and Honeywell International Inc. etc. But in spite of the healthcare monitoring devices are being predicted to be technologically innovative and providing advanced as well as basic health care monitoring features and available in various price ranges based on the features, we wanted to empirically study the attitude towards adoption of such devices in India. India has traditionally been having a very lackadaisical attitude towards healthcare monitoring. In such a context, what would be the factors influencing the adoption of SWH devices. Remote health monitoring can enhance the nature of wellbeing administration and to lessen the aggregate expense in human services by maintaining a strategic distance from pointless hospitalizations and guaranteeing that the individuals who need critical consideration get it sooner. This empirical investigation would provide a detailed insight as to how these wearable Internet Of Things devices would bring about a revolution in the healthcare industry. It would also provide the future prospect of IOT devices in this sector and how the probability of increase in its usage can be increased with time. The paper explores intrusiveness (INTR), Comfort (C), perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (EOU) of SWH devices. The study hypothesized the Impact of PU and EOU, INTR and C on attitude and intention to use towards adoption of SWH devices. Partial Least Square Structured Equation Modeling (PLS – SEM) methodology was applied to explore the relationships between the concepts and hypothesis. The data was collected from 273 respondents.

"Sahraoui, Sofiane",2007.0,{E-inclusion as a further stage of e-government?,"Purpose An IT rationalist discourse predominates in the e-government literature. Furthermore, and whenever an alternative and holistic discourse is developed, e-government evaluation remains mechanistic. E-inclusion is rightfully advocated as a socially inclusive strategy for e-government planning and development but it is erroneously considered as a further stage of e-government development, following the fourth and transactional stage. The paper aims to reconfigure e-government and e-inclusion as two parallel processes of government intervention to support a socially inclusive development strategy through a national IT strategy. Design/methodology/approach This paper reviews the general discourse surrounding e-government development and implementation, highlighting its mechanistic underpinnings and contrasting it with an inclusive approach to e-government. The mechanistic discourse of e-government is analyzed through key constructs that underlie the e-government concept. Vision and objectives, e-government evaluation, e-government models and the enabling role of ICT will be analyzed in view of sorting out the predominance of a mechanistic theme in their elaboration. The synthesis part of this work introduces e-inclusion based on a more organic and community-centered approach to e-government in light of the insufficiencies earlier identified. Findings Whilst e-inclusion provides a good platform to pinpoint insufficiencies of the predominant mechanistic approach to e-government, it remains doubtful whether it could be achieved within the realm of e-government programs alone. Practical implications Models, roadmaps and strategies for e-inclusion should explicitly outline the premises for a socially inclusive e-government and not consider e-inclusion as a further and mechanical stage of the e-government stage model. E-government evaluation has to pinpoint the inclusion aspects of existing projects by going beyond mechanistic measurements. Originality/value This paper questions a major assumption in the e-government literature, namely that e-inclusion follows e-government. By drawing from the political science literature, it identifies a niche for e-inclusion which helps reconceptualize it as socially inclusive government rather than a further stage of e-government. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1108/17506160710733698,article

This study offers a blockchain-based innovative e-participation system to increase democratic engagement in a secure and decentralized environment as centralized servers struggle with transparency, security, and privacy concerns. Decentralized, immutable, and incorruptible blockchain technology solves these challenges. The proposed e-participation system can encourage public participation in governance and promote democracy. The proposed E-participation is based on a model that includes government agencies, the public/citizens, digital platforms, decision-making, communication/feedback, and decision-making. This research uses national population data and election codes and regulations to run experiments and simulation models. Process simulation will develop and build the e-participation system's software, hardware, and storage devices. The proposed four layers of blockchain-based e-participation are integrated. They have their purposes, which include government agencies, registration and verification, a blockchain-based e-participation network, and data storage.",https://doi.org/10.1109/ICETAS59148.2023.10346551,article

The analysis has provided a mixed outcome in improving governance through e-participation, showing a significant relationship between e-participation and corruption-perception, and government effectiveness. Meanwhile, the relationships between e-participation and voice and accountability are insignificant.

However, despite the fact that public participation has been declared to take place quite often, there are very few occasions when such projects' effectiveness is evaluated. Modern literature offers a range of recommendations related to selection of criteria and evaluation methods for public participation projects. However, on the one hand, most recommendations involve additional interaction with project participants in order to make an assessment and virtually no “contactless” evaluation methods have been proposed (methods based on the published project reports). On the other hand, among the considered criteria we have not found a very important group of criteria – criteria for evaluating the significance of questions submitted for discussion for people's well-being. Therefore, this article aims to develop a methodology for evaluating e-participation projects based on the published project reports. The proposed evaluation methodology has been used to assess a project titled “Active citizen”. It was concluded that the subject matter of questions discussed on “Active citizen” platform largely reflect the subject matter of problems facing the Muscovites.

E-government projects have altered how government institutions communicate, share content, collaborate, and interact with citizens. Nowadays, e-government systems are crucial resources for facilitating government work and interaction with other people and organizations to co-operation with each other. Despite the availability of authentic research studies on the trend of e-government, there is still a need to conduct a comprehensive review and combine findings from earlier studies, as well as to define the current issues surrounding e-participation in the context of e-government initiatives. Objective: The main aim of this study is to review the previous literature to explore and understand the issues surrounding e-participation within the context of e-government initiatives, and to what extent these issues impact the success of these initiatives. Method: In this study, a systematic review method has been used to gather, analyze, and synthesize data regarding the accuracy and value of previous articles. This method followed a predefined review protocol and used both automated and manual research methods to find all the relevant research papers that were published in digital databases between 2010 and 2020. Results: According to the review study, we extracted 211 articles that addressed the key issues that negatively affected the level of e-participation, which were analyzed by following a systematic mapping method that collected significant information to fulfill the research aim. We classified and investigated the published papers that addressed a broad range of topics, including three crucial issues: user acceptance, interaction, and participation. As a result of the weight analysis, computer self-efficacy and perceived ease of use were found to be the best predictors of whether people want to use e-government systems. Performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, and service quality were also found to be promising predictors of satisfaction with e-government services that need more study. Conclusions: This systematic review found a high need for more research on this vast topic, as e-participation is critical to e-government performance and is evolving with ICT.

This task is not easy due to the specific characteristics of such systems, and the natural resistance of Critical Infrastructures operators against actions implying downtime. Digital Twins, as accurate virtual models of physical objects or processes, can provide a faithful environment for security analysis or evaluation of potential mitigation strategies to be deployed in face of specific situations. Nonetheless, their on-premises deployment can be expensive, implying a significant CAPEX whose return will depend on the ability to plan and deploy a suitable support infrastructure, as well as implementing efficient and scalable data collection and processing mechanisms capable of taking advantage of the acquired resources. This paper presents an off-premises approach to design and deploy Digital Twins to secure critical infrastructures, developed in the scope of the ELEGANT project. Such Digital Twins are built using real-time, high fidelity replicas of Programming Logic Controllers, coupled with scalable and efficient data collection processes, supporting the development and validation of Machine Learning models to mitigate security threats like Denial of Service attacks. The validation approach of ELEGANT, which leveraged from the capabilities of the Fed4Fire federated testbeds evaluated the feasibility of using cloudified Digital Twins, thus converting a significant part of the projected CAPEX for the in-premises model into on-demand, pay-as-you-go OPEX, eventually paving the way for the establishment of a DTaaS (Digital Twin as a Service) paradigm. The achieved results demonstrate that the data pipelines providing support for the ELEGANT Digital Twins have low impact in terms of resource usage in Denial of Service and Distributed Denial of Service attack scenarios, when higher volumes of data are generated.",https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3100708,article

To reduce the time to implementation and optimise the monetary cost of various solutions, the plans and policies of local authorities and stakeholders would benefit from undergoing a series of virtual stress tests. To this end, prescriptive and predictive technologies are widely adopted to optimise city planning and to understand the urban processes and environment such as air pollution and transportation. Nevertheless, holistic sandboxes tightly integrated with cities are still largely lacking. The city digital twin is a promising concept that provides a tool for exploration of new solutions in a controlled environment before their deployment. The digital twin is a virtual replica of the real city, which collects data from the infrastructure, processes and services using not only the available systems, but also purposely built connected devices and sensors. In this context, the establishment of urban living labs facilitates the monitoring and understanding of urban processes and enriches the digital twin with highly-relevant data. This paper presents an urban living lab, under deployment in the district of Lozenets in Sofia, Bulgaria. It is part of a larger initiative for developing a city digital twin of Sofia to support the design, exploration, and experimentation of different solutions. The living lab is equipped with sensors for monitoring air quality, atmospheric parameters, noise pollution and pedestrian flows.

Drawing on a literature search covering the period from April 2006 to March 2011, this study identifies, analyzes, and classifies 122 research articles within the categories of eParticipation actors, activities, contextual factors, effects, evaluation, and methods. Findings show that the field has a high level of dynamism, as foci on eParticipation activities, contextual factors, and effects have shifted in time, sometimes in counterintuitive directions. The study also suggests new analytical categories of research. Drawing on the analysis, inputs for a research agenda are suggested. These include the need to move beyond a technological perspective, encouraging the ongoing shift of research focus from government to citizens and other stakeholders, and the need to make eParticipation research methods more participatory in nature. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.GIQ.2012.02.010,article

This paper reports a literature study of conceptual publications on the subject of eParticipation/eDemocracy in the time frame of 2007-2009. Its objectives are to track recent theoretical development in the field, to reveal constraints and limitations to researching the area, and to offer some suggestions for further inquiry. The results show that most theories currently used in conceptual eParticipation research originate from the fields of Political Science and Media and Communication Studies. But together with this, contemporary eParticipation authors contribute to strengthening the field with some ""in-house"" models and frameworks as well. Central problems with eParticipation research concern immaturity of the field, topical gaps, and biased assumptions. The review shows that the themes of recent publications can be grouped into three major categories: stakeholders, environment, and applications and tools. It also finds some interconnections between these categories; however, in general the coupling technology-stakeholders-(participatory) environments is weak. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.GIQ.2011.11.005,article

This essay argues that urban planning can be revisited today through the lens of the ‘commons'. The notion of commons can be seen as the key to approach top-down and bottom-up initiatives in a systematic way. In this contribution, we argue that collective self-building in Amsterdam-Noord is a type of commons-based urban planning that occupies a unique territory in between state-led and market-led practices, and private efforts of urban development. By correlating the evolving definitions of the commons with the omnipresent dilemmas of urban planning, this essay intends to draw a link between the two, arguing for a more resilient form of city-making. We argue that commons-based urban planning offers a resilient alternative to the master plan, as one of its key strengths lies in the economic and social models it is based on. Finally, this essay attempts to examine the ways new technologies allow us today to revisit and reform the understanding of self-initiation and shared resources in urban environments.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-13-2694-3_6,article

We consider different policy scenarios proposed in the LES and the forward-looking policy uncertainty embedded in different economic sectors, primarily domestic, industrial and commercial and transport.

According to the obtained results, the key barrier to the development of smart cities in Poland is the unsatisfactory level of prosperity of the residents and the difficult financial situation of cities, which means that the vast majority of the surveyed areas are not able to attempt to get closer to the Smart City 1.0 generation. In contacts with stakeholders, Polish cities prefer the triple helix model, focused on business cooperation and creating favourable conditions for commercial entrepreneurship. Relationships of higher order helices (with communities or ecological organisations) are not a priority for them, which may contribute to the aggravation of urban pathologies in the form of unsustainability and socio-economic exclusion.

However, little is known about SOM and C variability in miombo woodlands which is a significant ecosystem in sub-Sahara African forests and vital for REDD+ strategies. In this study, nine edaphic factors were measured and used to analyse the variability of SOM in miombo woodland sites with different tree structures in Luanshya, Zambia. The findings showed a large variability of SOM stocks at different soil depths: 36.67 to 113.89 Mg ha-1 at 0–10 cm depth, 28.67 to 79.56 Mg ha-1 at 10–20 cm depth, and 31.89 to 98.56 Mg ha-1 at 20–30 cm depth. These SOM values at different depths also varied between miombo woodland sites of different successional stages, notably that areas affected by recent tree clearance had higher than average SOM content per layer (0–10 cm: +5.57%; 10–20 cm: +4.20%; 20–30 cm: +4.30%). Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed that the most significant environmental factors influencing SOM were woodland thinning by clearance, and silt content within soils. This study highlights that CCA can be used to show the relative importance of different forest successional stages as a function of management practices, as well as edaphic factors, in determining miombo soil SOM content.

Each section is accompanied by a critical commentary on the research insights presented, from third sector community and policy experts. The collection explores whether vulnerable populations face similar experiences and challenges in relation to their digital inclusion status, stressing the central presence of intersectionality, and arguing for the inclusion of the age, ethnicity/immigration status and disability aspects of one's identity. At the same time, it argues for multi-directional action that tackles intersectional discrimination in the digital realm on behalf of more than one single population category or group.

Inspired by the future possibilities of connected everyday devices, we envision a peripheral activity-based awareness system that captures human activity information and renders this information to enhance context awareness and support social connectedness between the elderly and their caregivers. Leveraging ambient intelligence and IoT technologies, ambient displays can convey activity information in the periphery of our attention. In particular, light has been used as a means to display ambient information and there is scientific evidence that it can enhance well-being, interconnectedness, and improve productivity. In this paper, we undertake two studies, first through an exploratory study we investigate the features of light suitable for conveying subtle activity information within the periphery of the users' attention for promoting context awareness. Also, we examine the preferences, perceptions, and interpretations of ambient lighting configurations of prospective caregiver's for conveying the activity information of older adults. In a second study, we assess the implications of activity awareness through lighting on cognitive performance, moods, and social connectedness. The set-up and design decisions of the second study were partly informed by previous research and by the outcomes of the first experiment. Together, these studies provide additional design guidelines for representing activity information with ambient lighting and highlight potential benefits and usage possibilities for lighting displays within the AAL domain.

In this study, using Landsat long-time series satellite images, we attempted to examine the dynamics of surface urban heat islands (SUHI) in Hangzhou from 2000 to 2020. Directional analysis, correlation analysis, and stepwise regression analysis were employed to detect the relationships between land surface temperature (LST) and landscape patterns. The results show that the changes of SUHI were mainly due to the urban expansion in suburban areas, and the intensity of SUHI in the urban center kept stable. The correlation between LST and forest was stronger over time with an increased proportion level. There was no correlation between LST and forest when the forest density was less than 20 ha/km2. However, when the forest density reached 80 ha/km2, the R2 of their correlation was 0.2921. The landscape configuration also affected the LST, and agglomerated water and forests showed a more substantial cooling effect. Compared with dense buildings, scattered buildings showed a weaker warming effect. These findings would be helpful for the current landscape configuration adjustment and future urban planning, with the promotion of sustainable development in Hangzhou.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2022.103717,article

This paper aims to understand the effects of security and privacy concerns on educational use of cloud services. We have proposed a research model based on Ajzen's (1991) Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). Following the TPB, we developed a research model, which posits that student attitudes predicted by security and privacy perceptions and behavioural intentions are predicted by attitudes towards using cloud services. A Structural Equation Model was used to assess the model based on the data collected by means of survey questionnaires from 200 pre-service teachers. Results supported the proposed model, validating the predictive power of the TPB. The results also indicate that security and privacy have a strongly significant influence on the students' attitudes towards using cloud services in educational settings. Implications of these findings are discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2014.11.075,article
{Abu Salim,2021.0,{Effects of smart city service channel- and user-characteristics on user satisfaction and continuance intention,"Purpose: Smart city services (SCS) in contrast with other technology-based services, demand significant interaction and collaboration between the users and the service providers. This study examines the SCS delivery-channel characteristics and the users' personal (behavioral and demographic) characteristics that influence their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the services, as well as their intention to adopt (i.e. continue using) the SCS-delivery channels. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative study using a structured questionnaire was conducted for this paper. The data-collection method was administered by emailing the survey to a list of 2,350 city/urban residents who are members of the two largest universities in the greater Dubai metropolis. A total of 600 completed responses (26 percent) were received back, while 580 useable responses (25 percent) were analyzed for this paper. Findings: Our initial findings suggest that contrary to popular belief, it is not only SCS channel factors that influence user satisfaction and continuance intention. SCS users' personal characteristics (such as their user innovativeness and control-seeking behavior) are also pivotal in determining their satisfaction and intention to continue or not continue using the SCS-delivery channels. Research limitations/implications: The paper argues that both SCS channel factors and SCS users' personal characteristics jointly influence the users' experience of the services and therefore jointly determine their satisfaction with the service as well as their SCS usage continuance intention. The result of our research gives important insights into users' behaviors toward the emerging SCS channels in general, and it will be of great value to architects and designers of Smart City technologies around the world. Practical implications: The paper argues that both SCS channel factors and SCS users' personal (behavioral and demographic) characteristics jointly influence the users' trials of the services, and therefore jointly determine their satisfaction with the service as well as their SCS usage continuance intention. The result of our research gives important insights into users' behavioral intentions toward the emerging SCS channels in general; and it will be of great value to architects and designers of Smart City technologies around the world. Originality/value: This paper is one of the first few studies focused on investigating the antecedents of SCS usage behaviors in the Middle Eastern region.",https://doi.org/10.1108/ITP-06-2019-0300,article

Design/methodology/approach: This paper has taken a sincere endeavor to understand to what extent the success of the smart cities depends on the users' experience of the IT-enabled services, the backbone of smart cities, and how using IT-enabled services can improve the quality of the users' lifestyle. Initially, few hypotheses have been developed from literature review, followed by structured questionnaires. Once the data were collected, they were analyzed using different statistical tools. This paper will be useful for the policymakers, specifically those who are involved in technology and IT-governance-related areas, in policymaking for the proposed smart cities in India. Findings: This study tries to find how the IT-enabled services would transform the lives of residents both socially and technologically; to what extent the prospective citizens will be engaged to use the modern services; to what extent the threat of privacy and security issues affects the overall performance of the proposed smart cities of India; and how gaining trust of the citizens could help in successful adoption of IT services. This paper tries to find out few of these questions from the city residents' perspective. Research limitations/implications: This study is undertaken keeping Indian smart cities in perspective. However, in India, the proposed smart cities are in different states. In fact, the respondents selected by the authors are not the true representatives of the whole population, which is spread covering all parts of India. This paper could have implications for policymakers in drafting the smart city policy in India especially from IT-governance and user-experience perspective. Practical implications: As this study discusses proposed smart cities of India from IT-enabled services and from the citizens' perspective, it will have a huge practical implication once these smart cities become operational in India. Social implications: This study discusses the IT-enabled services expected to be provided to the citizens of the proposed smart cities of India. As the paper discusses about the citizens' perspective and the proposed smart cities of India, it definitely has social implications especially since the study is related to the citizens of proposed smart cities of India.

We hypothesized that the proportions of adult female and immature turtles in a population will negatively correlate with landscape urbanization. As a collaborative effort of the Ecological Research as Education Network (EREN), we sampled freshwater turtle populations in 11 states across the central and eastern United States. Contrary to expectations, we found a significant positive relationship between proportions of mature female painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) and urbanization. We did not detect a relationship between urbanization and proportions of immature turtles.

Although the solar energy can be well harvested by using existing technologies, the large amounts of wasted wind energy in the city cannot be effectively utilized since conventional wind turbine generators can only be installed in remote areas due to their large volumes and safety issues. Here, we rationally design a hybridized nanogenerator, including a solar cell (SC) and a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), that can individually/simultaneously scavenge solar and wind energies, which can be extensively installed on the roofs of the city buildings. Under the same device area of about 120 mm × 22 mm, the SC can deliver a largest output power of about 8 mW, while the output power of the TENG can be up to 26 mW. Impedance matching between the SC and TENG has been achieved by using a transformer to decrease the impedance of the TENG. The hybridized nanogenerator has a larger output current and a better charging performance than that of the individual SC or TENG.

Classical security algorithms that are built on complex cryptographic functions often require a level of processing that low-power IoT devices are incapable to effectively achieve due to limited power and processing resources. Consequently, the option for constrained IoT devices lies in either developing new security schemes or modifying existing ones to be more suitable for constrained IoT devices. In this work, an efficient security algorithm for constrained IoT devices, based on the advanced encryption standard, is proposed. We present a cryptanalytic overview of the consequence of complexity reduction together with a supporting mathematical justification, and provisioned a secure element (ATECC608A) as a tradeoff. The ATECC608A doubles for authentication and guarding against implementation attacks on the associated IoT device (ARM Cortex M4 micro-processor) in line with our analysis. The software implementation of the efficient algorithm for constrained IoT devices shows up to 35% reduction in the time it takes to complete the encryption of a single block (16 B) of plain text, in comparison to the currently used standard AES-128 algorithm, and in comparison to current results in literature at 26.6%.",https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2020.3033435,article

Identifying the appropriate level of analysis in the study of organizational networks","This paper examines the use of individual, dyadic and system-level analyses in the study of relational data in organizational networks. We argue that dyadic analyses are particularly appropriate when the dependent variable is quantitative and/or involves multiple behaviors. We show that system-level analyses, by aggregating potentially significant information, provide a less grounded account of the relations across networks than do dyadic analyses. Using examples from a study of corporate political behavior, we contrast dyadic analyses with those at both the individual and system-levels. Variables measured in raw dyadic form consistently perform better in accounting for similarity of corporate political behavior than do variables measured by taking system-level properties into account. Our findings suggest that although individual and system-level analyses are useful in a number of situations, dyadic analyses are a flexible means to examine the effects of multiple networks at multiple levels. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2005.06.002,article

Such approaches focus on digital and technology-driven urban innovation and are often considered to be a universal solution to varied urban issues in different cities. How Smart City policies operate in contemporary cities is being examined in the emerging, but still underdeveloped, academic field ‘smart urbanism'. The considerable consequences of Smart City strategies call for critical engagement with the rationale, methods, target group and implications of Smart City approaches in different urban contexts. The aim of this paper is to further such critical engagement by distilling dimensions absent in current smart urbanism. We do so by exploring both the academic field of critical urbanism and smart urbanism and through that develop our contributions to the smart urbanism debate from existing theoretical and conceptual approaches within critical urbanism. We distilled three dimensions that require further development to facilitate a comprehensive analysis of what Smart City policies mean for contemporary urban life: (1) the acknowledgement that the urban is not confined to the administrative boundaries of a city; (2) the importance of local social-economic, cultural-political and environmental contingencies in analysing the development, implementation and effects of Smart City policies; and (3) the social-political construction of both the urban problems Smart City policies aim to solve and the considered solutions.

Previous case studies on e-participation cover definitions and technique of e-participation, applicable strategies to implement e-participation, and the quality of e-participation for top management decision making. Several literature in EG supports the statement that e-participation could improve the quality of public sector governance process. As a result, most developed countries implemented EG projects to enable involvement of citizens in the political decision making process through e-participation. However, this is not the case in most of the developing countries which focus more on improving public sector services rather than e-participation. Among others, there are arguments which focus on the issue of lack of citizen participation in the political process through the Internet. This is particularly true in the context of EG implementation in developing countries whereby the focus is more on e-services rather than e- participation. Malaysian government has implemented EG, since 1997 under one of the MSC flagships, to deliver information and services in an integrated manner. Malaysian Government Portal or myGovernment performs as a single platform providing information and services related to government agencies.

While major attention is currently given to the dominant model of corporate platforms collecting and economically exploiting massive amounts of personal data, other actors, such as small businesses, public bodies and civic society, take also part in data governance. The article sheds light on four models emerging from the practices of these actors: data sharing pools, data cooperatives, public data trusts and personal data sovereignty. We propose a social science-informed conceptualisation of data governance. Drawing from the notion of data infrastructure we identify the models as a function of the stakeholders' roles, their interrelationships, articulations of value, and governance principles. Addressing the politics of data, we considered the actors' competitive struggles for governing data. This conceptualisation brings to the forefront the power relations and multifaceted economic and social interactions within data governance models emerging in an environment mainly dominated by corporate actors. These models highlight that civic society and public bodies are key actors for democratising data governance and redistributing value produced through data.

However, such forms are still associated with a number of problems, issues, and challenges. This mainly involves the question of how they should be monitored, understood, analyzed, and planned to improve, advance, and maintain their contribution to sustainability and thus to overcome the kind of wicked problems, unsettled issues, and complex challenges they embody. This in turn brings us to the current question related to the weak connection between and the extreme fragmentation of sustainable cities and smart cities as approaches and landscapes, respectively, despite the proven role of advanced ICT, coupled with the untapped potential of big data technology and its novel applications, in supporting sustainable cities as to enhancing and optimizing their performance under what is labeled “smart sustainable cities.” In this respect, there has recently been a conscious push for sustainable cities to become smart and thus more sustainable by particularly embracing what big data technology and its novel applications has to offer in the hopes of reaching the optimal level of sustainability. In the meantime, we are in the midst of an expansion of time horizons in city planning and development. In this context, sustainable cities across the globe have adopted ambitious smart goals that extend far into the future. Essentially, there are multiple visions of, and pathways to achieving, smart sustainable cities based on how they can be conceptualized and operationalized. The aim of this paper is to generate a vision for smart sustainable cities of the future by answering the 6 guiding questions for step 3 of the futures study being conducted. This study aims to analyze, investigate, and develop a novel model for smart sustainable cities of the future using backcasting as a scholarly approach. It involves a series of papers of which this paper is the second one, following the earlier papers with steps 1 and 2. Visionary images of a long-term future can stimulate an accelerated movement towards achieving the long-term goals of sustainability. The proposed model is believed to be the first of its kind and thus has not been, to the best of one's knowledge, produced, nor is it being currently investigated, elsewhere.",https://doi.org/10.1186/S40309-019-0157-0,misc

Employing a mixed-method research approach, the study conducted 30 semi-structured interviews with educated women and distributed a Likert Scale questionnaire to 500 women. The qualitative findings reveals that education significantly influences women's perspectives, guiding their priorities, and instilling a desire for compatibility and shared values in their relationships. Educated women also display resilience, confidence, and a readiness to challenge prevailing societal norms and gender stereotypes when selecting a life partner. Quantitative analysis establishes a statistically significant positive correlation between education and women's empowerment in mate selection. These findings underscore the pivotal role of education in enhancing women's agency and autonomy in a critical aspect of their lives. The study's implications extend to policy recommendations advocating for increased access to quality education and the implementation of gender-sensitive curricula in Malakand Division and analogous regions.

Unfortunately, most of the generated data is wasted without extracting potentially useful information and knowledge because of the lack of established mechanisms and standards that benefit from the availability of such data. Moreover, the highly dynamic nature of smart cities calls for a new generation of machine learning approaches that are flexible and adaptable to cope with the dynamicity of data to perform analytics and learn from real-Time data. In this article, we shed light on the challenge of underutilizing the big data generated by smart cities from a machine learning perspective. In particular, we present the phenomenon of wasting unlabeled data. We argue that semi-supervision is a must for smart cities to address this challenge. We also propose a three-level learning framework for smart cities that matches the hierarchical nature of big data generated by smart cities with a goal of providing different levels of knowledge abstraction. The proposed framework is scalable to meet the needs of smart city services. Fundamentally, the framework benefits from semi-supervised deep reinforcement learning where a small amount of data that has users' feedback serves as labeled data, while a larger amount without such users' feedback serves as unlabeled data. The framework utilizes a mix of labeled and unlabeled data to converge toward better control policies instead of wasting the unlabeled data. This article also explores how deep reinforcement learning and its shift toward semi-supervision can handle the cognitive side of smart city services and improve their performance by providing several use cases spanning the different domains of smart cities. We also highlight several challenges as well as promising future research directions for incorporating machine learning and high-level intelligence into smart city services.",https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700298,article

Particularly pertinent to the concept of e-government is that of electronic participation (e-participation) of citizens in services offered over an e-government platform, yet studies claim that such initiatives exacerbate the social exclusion problem. Globally, and specifically in Africa, the ineffective participation of citizens is marked by waning confidence in service delivery capabilities of political institutions, yet e-government is considered as one of the reform instrument for the attainment of good governance. Governments and pressure groups in many countries are realizing that these trends are problematic and are seeking to broaden and deepen citizen participation in governance, notably through the use of mobile technologies that continues to play a vital role in the trajectory of ICT development in Africa. This study advances the prominent role that mobile technology will play in anchoring e-participation strategies and policies to improve the social sustainability of ICT4D projects geared toward improving governance.

This has led to the concept of Smart cities where Information Communication and Technology (ICT) is merged with the existing traditional infrastructure of a city which is then coordinated and managed using digital technology. This idea of smart cities is slowly but surely coming into reality as many countries around the globe are adopting this idea and coming up with their own model of smart cities. At the core of smart city lies the sensors and actuators embedded in the smart devices that sense the environment for facilitating effective decision making. The microcontrollers available in these devices are programmed to take decisions automatically based on the information received from the sensors. This involves integration of several information and communication technologies like artificial intelligence, protocols, Internet of things (IoT), wireless sensor network (WSN) etc. This paper discusses and extensively reviews the role of enabling technologies in smart cities.

This study examines the acceptance of smart transportation systems (STSs) among residents in Polish cities and explores the impact of these systems on energy-saving behaviors. Using the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) model, which includes the propensity to save energy, this research seeks to understand the determinants of STS adoption. The primary research was conducted using Computer-Assisted Web Interviewing (CAWI). The sample was controlled for gender and place of residence. A sample of 471 individuals meeting the criteria of living in a city with over 200,000 residents and using smart transportation solutions in Poland were selected from the research panel. SmartPLS 4 software was used to analyze the collected data. The findings reveal that the propensity to save energy significantly influences perceived usefulness, ease of use, social influence, and hedonic motivation toward STSs. Perceived usefulness and ease of use were found to be strong predictors of the intention to use STSs, while perceived costs had a negative impact on it. This study also identified the moderating role of personal innovativeness in mitigating cost concerns. These insights underscore the importance of emphasizing energy conservation benefits and user-friendly features in promoting the use of STSs. This study concludes that aligning technological innovations with user motivations for energy conservation can enhance the adoption of sustainable transportation solutions, contributing to smarter and more sustainable urban environments.",https://doi.org/10.3390/EN17215341,article
"Bojarski, Mariusz and {Del Testa",2016.0,{End to End Learning for Self-Driving Cars,"We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to map raw pixels from a single front-facing camera directly to steering commands. This end-to-end approach proved surprisingly powerful. With minimum training data from humans the system learns to drive in traffic on local roads with or without lane markings and on highways. It also operates in areas with unclear visual guidance such as in parking lots and on unpaved roads. The system automatically learns internal representations of the necessary processing steps such as detecting useful road features with only the human steering angle as the training signal. We never explicitly trained it to detect, for example, the outline of roads. Compared to explicit decomposition of the problem, such as lane marking detection, path planning, and control, our end-to-end system optimizes all processing steps simultaneously. We argue that this will eventually lead to better performance and smaller systems. Better performance will result because the internal components self-optimize to maximize overall system performance, instead of optimizing human-selected intermediate criteria, e.g., lane detection. Such criteria understandably are selected for ease of human interpretation which doesn't automatically guarantee maximum system performance. Smaller networks are possible because the system learns to solve the problem with the minimal number of processing steps. We used an NVIDIA DevBox and Torch 7 for training and an NVIDIA DRIVE(TM) PX self-driving car computer also running Torch 7 for determining where to drive.

But, the main constraint faced by researchers is the energy source available with sensor nodes. To prolong the life of sensor nodes and thus HWSN, it is necessary to design energy efficient operational schemes. One of the most suitable approaches to enhance energy efficiency is the clustering scheme, which enhances the performance parameters of WSN. A novel solution proposed in this article is to design an energy efficient clustering protocol for HWSN, to enhance performance parameters by EECPEP-HWSN. The proposed protocol is designed with three level nodes namely normal, advanced, and super, respectively. In the clustering process, for selection of cluster head we consider different parameters available with sensor nodes at run time that is, initial energy, hop count, and residual energy. This protocol enhances the energy efficiency of HWSN and hence improves energy remaining in the network, stability, lifetime, and hence throughput. It has been found that the proposed protocol outperforms than existing well-known LEACH, DEEC, and SEP with about 188, 150, and 141 percent respectively.",https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/2078627,article

The city is the hub of modern human life and the urban transport sector is developing fast. Specifically, in the Internet era, the development of public transport has brought new challenges and opportunities to urban passenger transport. Thus, research on the energy demand and environmental emissions of the urban transport sector is significant and timely. This paper takes Beijing's public transport as an example and applies the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP) model to analyze the energy demand and the main greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions under different scenarios during the period 2016–2030. The results show that: 1) if the government fails to guide the development of passenger transport appropriately, its energy demand and GHG emissions will rise rapidly and under the baseline scenario, the energy demand and emissions in 2030 are about 1.8 times those oft 2015; 2) the scenarios of developing public transport and transport sharing have a significant effect of energy saving and emission reduction and in 2030 the energy demand and GHG emissions falls by 25%–30% compared with that of the baseline scenario, so the combination of public transport and transport sharing is a wise choice for the low carbon development of the passenger transport sector in Beijing; 3) scenarios of easing road congestion and new-energy and clean-energy vehicle development have huge potential for energy saving and emission reduction, particularly the internal adjustment of the energy structure in the scenario of developing new-energy and clean-energy vehicles, which can greatly reduce the demand for traditional energy sources and reduce GHG emissions. This paper illustrates the development trends of energy demand and GHG emissions in Beijing's passenger transport sector under the scenarios of transport sharing development and traditional development in the Internet era, providing a basis for decision making.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.JCLEPRO.2017.07.106,article

An energy efficient clustering algorithm with optimum parameters is designed for reducing the energy consumption and prolonging the system lifetime. An analytical clustering model with one-hop distance and clustering angle is given. The optimum one-hop distance and clustering angle are formulated by minimizing the energy consumption between inter-cluster and intra-cluster. Furthermore, the continuous working mechanism of each cluster head which acts as the local control center and will not be replaced by the candidate cluster head until its continuous working times reach the optimum values is given, and the optimum continuous working times of each cluster head can be obtained through the optimum one-hop distance and the clustering angle. With the mechanism, the frequency of updating cluster head and the energy consumption for establishing new cluster head can be reduced. The simulation results demonstrate that the clustering algorithm can effectively reduce the energy consumption and increase the system lifetime. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aeue.2009.01.004,article

Antibiotic disruption of intestinal microbiota enabled efficient colonization by wild-type EPEC resulting in growth impairment and diarrhea. Increase in inflammatory biomarkers, chemokines, cellular recruitment and pro-inflammatory cytokines were observed in intestinal tissues. Metabolomic changes were also observed in EPEC infected mice with changes in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, increased creatine excretion and shifts in gut microbial metabolite levels. In addition, by 7 days after infection, although weights were recovering, EPEC-infected mice had increased intestinal permeability and decreased colonic claudin-1 levels. The escN mutant colonized the mice with no weight loss or increased inflammatory biomarkers, showing the importance of the T3SS in EPEC virulence in this model. In conclusion, a murine infection model treated with antibiotics has been developed to mimic clinical outcomes seen in children with EPEC infection and to examine potential roles of selected virulence traits.

"Bodde, David L. and Taiber, Joachim G.",2014.0,{Entrepreneurship for urban mobility systems,"The challenge to urban mobility arises from several intersecting trends: rapidly increasing urban populations; inadequate to non-existent infrastructure; ageing populations seeking to retain independent mobility, chiefly in the developed countries; and youthful populations seeking access to jobs, chiefly in the developing world. The consequences include: inferior service; wasted time from traffic congestion; pollution concentrated among dense populations, and inadequate vehicle parking. These challenges cannot be met by relying upon incremental improvements to the technologies and systems currently in place. Instead, radical entrepreneurial innovation must be allowed to offer disruptive improvements to the current mobility systems. However, singular innovations alone cannot unlock the full power of advanced technologies. In addition, large-scale, timely innovation will require ecosystem platforms to compete effectively with the incumbent business models and technologies. The most effective innovation ecosystems will find ways to include entrepreneurs in a predictable, systematic manner. Several kinds of kind of institutions can play a constructive role: governments at all levels to remove policy risk from the more customary risks to innovation; research universities through their teaching of innovation; entrepreneur support organizations; and, venture forums that connect startup companies to industry incumbents.",https://doi.org/10.1109/IEVC.2014.7056102,article

In the 1990s, mounting concern over environment and development problems has meant greater support for an educational approach, which not only considers immediate environmental improvement as an actual goal, but also addresses educating for ‘sustainability' in the long term. Although some education literature has embraced this new focus of environmental education for sustainability (EEFS), it has failed to outline the essence of this approach and has neglected questions about how it differs from the environmental education of the 1980s. No document exists to date which translates the goals of EEFS into guiding principles for its development in schools. Essentially, EEFS needs further definition. This paper is an attempt to engage the debate about what constitutes this new focus of environmental education and how it may differ from conventional approaches to environmental education. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1080/1350462950010206,article

The findings broadly show that ICT can be employed to dampen the potentially negative effect of environmental pollution on human development. We establish that: (i) ICT complements CO2 emissions from liquid fuel consumption to increase inclusive development; (ii) ICT interacts with CO2 intensity to negatively affect inclusive human development and (iii) the net effect on inclusive human development is positive from the complementarity between mobile phones and CO2 emissions per capita. Conversely, we also establish evidence of net negative effects. Fortunately, the corresponding ICT thresholds at which these net negative effects can be completely dampened are within policy range, notably: 50 (per 100 people) mobile phone penetration for CO2 emissions from liquid fuel consumption and CO2 intensity.

The group agreed that there was a major piece of work to be done in reframing the library and information science discipline in terms of information poverty. Four key dimensions of information poverty for collaborative future research are: (1) information as an agent to eradicate poverty; (2) the causal factors resulting in information poverty; (3) creation and production activities to combat information poverty; and (4) better understanding of areas of extreme disadvantage and aspects of information need.

However, whether these wearable devices are valid at different levels of exercise intensity is unknown. Objective: The objective of this study was to examine heart rate (HR) and energy expenditure (EE) validity of 3 popular wrist-worn activity monitors at different exercise intensities. Methods: A total of 62 participants (females: 58%, 36/62; nonwhite: 47% [13/62 Hispanic, 8/62 Asian, 7/62 black/ African American, 1/62 other]) wore the Apple Watch, Fitbit Charge HR, and Garmin Forerunner 225. Validity was assessed using 2 criterion devices: HR chest strap and a metabolic cart. Participants completed a 10-minute seated baseline assessment; separate 4-minute stages of light-, moderate-, and vigorous-intensity treadmill exercises; and a 10-minute seated recovery period. Data from devices were compared with each criterion via two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance and Bland-Altman analysis. Differences are expressed in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Results: For the Apple Watch, HR MAPE was between 1.14% and 6.70%. HR was not significantly different at the start (P=.78), during baseline (P=.76), or vigorous intensity (P=.84); lower HR readings were measured during light intensity (P=.03), moderate intensity (P=.001), and recovery (P=.004). EE MAPE was between 14.07% and 210.84%. The device measured higher EE at all stages (P<.01). For the Fitbit device, the HR MAPE was between 2.38% and 16.99%. HR was not significantly different at the start (P=.67) or during moderate intensity (P=.34); lower HR readings were measured during baseline, vigorous intensity, and recovery (P<.001) and higher HR during light intensity (P<.001). EE MAPE was between 16.85% and 84.98%. The device measured higher EE at baseline (P=.003), light intensity (P<.001), and moderate intensity (P=.001). EE was not significantly different at vigorous (P=.70) or recovery (P=.10). For Garmin Forerunner 225, HR MAPE was between 7.87% and 24.38%. HR was not significantly different at vigorous intensity (P=.35). The device measured higher HR readings at start, baseline, light intensity, moderate intensity (P<.001), and recovery (P=.04). EE MAPE was between 30.77% and 155.05%. The device measured higher EE at all stages (P<.001). Conclusions: This study provides one of the first validation assessments for the Fitbit Charge HR, Apple Watch, and Garmin Forerunner 225. An advantage and novel approach of the study is the examination of HR and EE at specific physical activity intensities. Establishing validity of wearable devices is of particular interest as these devices are being used in weight loss interventions and could impact findings.

"Mark, Ryan",2019.0,{Ethics of Public Use of AI and Big Data,"Smart information systems (Big Data and artificial intelligence) are used by governments to improve mobility, reduce over-crowdedness in hotspots, and provide more effective management of crowds. I looked at how Amsterdam municipality is using smart information systems (SIS) in their DrukteRadar Project to identify, report, and tackle issues surrounding crowdedness levels in the city. 
 SIS are becoming popular amongst governmental officials to automate activities more effectively. SIS provide the opportunity to improve mobility, increase economic growth, reduce energy outputs, improve management decisions, respond to disasters quicker, and improve citizens' quality of life. They offer governments the possibility of improving services, while reducing costs. The use and implementation of SIS is becoming widespread and governments are observing the benefits posed by SIS, particularly in relation to urban management.  
 80% of Europe's population will live in cities by 2020 and governments face a huge strain on resources and infrastructure. The use of SIS is being pioneered to help governments meet these needs and to provide a sustainable future for urban citizens. Ethical issues in this context can include that data may not be accurate, faithful or representative of a city and its citizens, which may cause bias, prejudice and harm to a population, by leading to unfair service provision. ICT companies' involvement in governmental SIS projects may also lead to technological lock-in and dependency on corporations. Instantaneous and ubiquitous retrieval and analysis of data may infringe upon citizens' privacy and may lead vulnerabilities of malicious hacking, stolen data and a city's security.
 To uncover if these issues correlate with the experience of those working in the field, I interviewed the Project Owner of Amsterdam's DrukteRadar project (translated as crowdedness project). This project implements SIS to anticipate and prevent overcrowding in Amsterdam, and was created in response to growing pressures on the city's amenities. The DrukteRadar Project collates a wide array of datasets to predict crowd levels and potential problem hotspots, visualised through a digital dashboard. The project aims to improve municipality management, provide help to tourists planning their trips, and assisting citizens' navigation through the city.
 Through my discussions with the Project Owner of the DrukteRadar, I uncovered two additional issues not found in the literature: access to SIS and data ownership. The DrukteRadar team is concerned about access to SIS to promote fairness, equality, and provision of services amongst citizens. It aims to make its dashboard user-friendly and available to as many people as possible to promote inclusion. Data ownership is a concern for the project – who owns the data and what can be done with it. The DrukteRadar Project ensures they have data sovereignty, so that they do not become technologically locked-in to relationships with private organisations. 
 The Project Owner was aware that inaccurate of data may lead to discriminatory recommendations and harmful consequences. The DrukteRadar Project tries to minimise their algorithmic inaccuracy through extensive monitoring; secure technical infrastructure; and stakeholder review sessions. Another interesting finding was identifying how projects ensure privacy protection of its citizens. The DrukteRadar ensures that data is not traceable to individuals and the use of datasets follow privacy-by-design principles. The project also has strong security protocols, cyber-security measures, anonymization techniques, and repeated vulnerability tests. Overall, my report was able to evaluate how ethical issues found within the SIS literature correlate to those identified, and tackled, in practice. as well as highlighting the two additional concerns not explicitly mentioned in the literature.",https://doi.org/10.29297/ORBIT.V2I1.101,article

About 170,000 Acehnese and Minangkabau people died in the Northern tip of Sumatra while only 44 Simeulue people passed away in the neighbouring Simeulue island located near the earthquake epicentre. Such a difference in the death toll does not lie in the nature of the hazard but in different human behaviours and ethnic contexts. The present study draws on a contextual framework of analysis where people's behaviour in the face of natural hazards is deeply influenced by the cultural, social, economic and political context. Questionnaire-based surveys among affected communities, key informant interviews and literature reviews show that the people of Simeulue detected the tsunami very early and then escaped to the mountains. On the other hand, Acehnese and Minangkabau people, respectively in the cities of Banda Aceh and Meulaboh, did not anticipate the phenomenon and were thus caught by the waves. The different behaviours of the victims have been commanded by the existence or the absence of a disaster subculture among affected communities as well as by their capacity to protect themselves in facing the tsunami. People's behaviours and the capacity to protect oneself can be further tracked down to a deep tangle of intricate factors which include the armed conflict that has been affecting the province since the 1970s, the historical and cultural heritage and the national political economy system. This paper finally argues that the uneven impact of the 26 December 2004 earthquake and tsunami in Aceh lies in the different daily life conditions of the ethnic groups struck by the disaster. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1007/S11069-007-9193-3,article
"Abbink, Jon",2011.0,{Ethnic-based federalism and ethnicity in Ethiopia: Reassessing the experiment after 20 years,"One of the core principles instituted by the post-1991 government in Ethiopia that took power after a successful armed struggle was ethnic-based federalism, informed by a neo-Leninist political model called revolutionary democracy. In this model, devised by the reigning Tigray People's Liberation Front (later EPRDF), ethnic identity was to be the basis of politics. Identities of previously non-dominant groups were constitutionally recognized and the idea of pan-Ethiopian identity de-emphasized. This article examines the general features and effects of this new political model, often dubbed an ""experiment"", with regard to ideas of federal democracy, socio-economic inclusiveness, and ethno-cultural and political rights. After 20 years of TPLF/EPRDF rule, the dominant rhetorical figure in Ethiopian politics is that of ethnicity, which has permeated daily life and overtaken democratic decision-making and shared issue-politics. The federal state, despite according nominal decentralized power to regional and local authorities, is stronger than any previous Ethiopian state and has developed structures of central control and top-down rule that preclude local initiative and autonomy. Ethnic and cultural rights were indeed accorded, and a new economic dynamics is visible. Political liberties, respect for human rights and economic equality are however neglected, and ethnic divisions are on the increase, although repressed. Ethiopia's recent political record thus shows mixed results, with positive elements but also an increasingly authoritarian governance model recalling the features of the country's traditional hierarchical and autocratic political culture. This may produce more debate on the need for ""adjusting the experiment"". {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1080/17531055.2011.642516,article

However, the selected IoT-D may send partial (or even none) AN, which is called an untrusted jammer. To avoid selecting an untrusted jammer, we aim to design two quantitative models from the perspective of time and space to evaluate the trustworthiness of IoT-Ds. Firstly, we adopt an improved energy detector to better counter signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) fluctuation of AN detection. Secondly, based on the detection results, we adopt two trust models: (1) the spatial-oriented beta trust model, (2) the time-oriented hidden Markov model (HMM)-based trust model. In the first model, direct and indirect trust of an IoT-D are both calculated to obtain an integrated trust value. In the second model, the probability of trusted state is calculated as the trust value, and time intervals between detection results of an IoT-D are taken into consideration.

This study develops a multi-hazard risk scenario – combining earthquake, triggered landslides, and their cascading impacts on road transportation – to assess the potential impact of a 7.3 magnitude earthquake on the city's infrastructure and emergency response systems. Using a GIS-based hazard model integrated with demographic and structural data, we analysed the impacts of earthquakes and landslides on road accessibility, mortality rates, and the effectiveness of disaster relief efforts. The findings reveal that Tabriz's emergency response capabilities and main roads, particularly in the northern districts, would be critically impacted by both the earthquake and subsequent landslides, resulting in significant delays in rescue operations and a high loss of life. Up to 30 % of the city's buildings are at risk of collapse, with the most vulnerable populations — including children, women, and low-income communities—facing the greatest risk. The projected death toll could reach 17 %, with casualties rising further if emergency response is delayed. Moreover, areas previously considered relatively safe from seismic risks may still suffer substantial damage due to landslides. This study underscores the urgent need for enhanced disaster planning and response taken into account the cascading effects of earthquake.

Although this Index can be applied to any city worldwide, the research focuses on the Spanish context, with a selection of six cases of different sizes and urban typologies. The results highlight the features that most influence the smartness of a city's mobility, and can be used to design the appropriate transport policies. Finally, the cities are ranked according to the performance of their smart transportation systems.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.SCS.2018.01.029,article

The global trend of digital transformation has profound implications for urban innovation; however, the specific effects of digital transformation on urban innovation resilience remain insufficiently explored. This study utilizes panel data from 285 prefecture-level and above cities in China, spanning from 2007 to 2022. It treats the Broadband China Pilot (BCP) policy as a quasi-natural experiment of digital transformation and employs a time-varying Difference-in-Differences (DID) method to investigate the impact of digital transformation on urban innovation resilience. The results yield several important insights: (i) digital transformation enhances urban innovation resilience; (ii) the effect of digital transformation on urban innovation resilience is heterogeneous across regions and city sizes; (iii) digital transformation improves urban innovation resilience through the mediation effect of green total factor productivity (GTFP); (iv) urban industrial upgrading and urban innovation vitality play significant moderating roles in the relationship between digital transformation and urban innovation resilience. These findings contribute to a deeper theoretical understanding of the relationship between digital transformation and urban innovation resilience.",https://doi.org/10.3390/systems13010008,article

E-government is an approach to use the Web to convey government data and administrations to people. People think that it is hard to involve themselves in e-government due to the inadequate trust they are yet to develop with e-government. In the current e-government literature, many authors have worked to figure out factors that may have an influence towards e-government and build trust models. However, e-government in Kuwait is still developing and there is no study conducted about trust in e-government. Thus, this study structures the trust model keeping the context of the Kuwaiti society in view by including important factors that are affecting the citizens' determination to trust e-government in Kuwait. Accordingly, a questionnaire is designed to test the conceptual model and the analyzed data uncovers that different factors determine the people intention to trust e-government, such as perceived usefulness, security, website quality, and social influence.",https://doi.org/10.1145/3323933.3324073,article

An evaluation was conducted based on mean state, trends, and statistical metrics (Bias, Correlation Coefficient, Root Mean Square Difference, and Taylor skill score). For projections over EA, five best performing CMIP6 models (based on their performance ranking in historical mean temperature simulations) under the shared socioeconomic pathways SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios were employed. The historical simulations reveal an overestimation of the mean annual T2m cycle over the study region with fewer models depicting underestimations. Further, CMIP6 models reproduce the spatial and temporal trends within the observed range proximity. Overall, the best performing models are as follows: FGOALS-g3, HadGEM-GC31-LL, MPI-ESM2-LR, CNRM-CM6-1,andIPSL-CM6A-LR. During the three-time slices under consideration, the Multi Model Ensemble (MME) project many changes during the late period (2080–2100) with expected mean changes at 2.4 °C for SSP2-4.5 and 4.4 °C for the SSP5-8.5 scenario. The magnitude of change based on Sen's slope estimator and Mann-Kendall test reveal significant increasing tendencies with projections of 0.24 °C decade-1 (0.65 °C decade-1) under SSP2-4.5(SSP5-8.5) scenarios. The findings from this study illustrate higher warming in the latest model outputs of CMIP6 relative to its predecessor, despite identical instantaneous radiative forcing.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.JAFREARSCI.2021.104226,article
"Johnston, Kim A. and Taylor, Maureen and Ryan, Barbara",2024.0,{Evaluation of Community Engagement for Resilience Outcomes: A Pre-Engagement Approach,"Recent disasters have placed enormous pressure on communities to be more resilient. Community resilience encompasses a range of structural, economic, and social dimensions that affect a community's ability to withstand change and disruption from disaster events. In recognition of the social processes that contribute to resilience, governments have increased investment in community engagement programs based on the assumption these programs of activity contribute to community resilience. While several studies identify the indicators of community resilience, few operationalize these indicators for community engagement in a way that can be used to establish baselines and evaluate change overtime. This paper addresses this gap. In-depth interviews with 16 community engagement practitioners in Australia investigated how community resilience in flood prone communities was conceptualized and how the outcomes from engaging communities for resilience building were identified. Findings from the study and the extant literature on resilience empirically informed the development of a four-step pre-engagement approach that extends current community engagement models and supports the measurement of engagement activities and aligned resilient outcomes. The pre-engagement approach can be adapted to diverse community contexts beyond flood emergencies and beyond Australian borders.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2024.104613,article

To address this challenge, this study conducts a systematic literature review by using legitimacy theory as a point of departure. It examines tools that capture three dimensions of sustainability – social, economic and environmental (SEE) – and firm size. Design/methodology/approach: Top four journal databases in the social sciences from the FT50 review were searched to identify articles published in peer-reviewed journals in the 2009-2019 period, using keywords to conceptualise the construct. For comprehensive assessment, this study adopted a method that requires the logic synthesis of concepts and evidence emerging from the literature to address the research aim. Findings: The results show that most of the articles developed tools or frameworks to measure SI based on the triple bottom line of sustainability – SEE – and firm size. However, there is insufficient evidence of their integration into practice. Research limitations/implications: This work contributes to the legitimisation of social enterprises (SEs) by using validated tools and frameworks to develop practical suggestions for SI measurement (SIM). Originality/value: As legitimacy is an important rationale for SIM, this study adds value through the development of a suitability framework.

The “health state” of smart homes is comprised of many different levels; starting with the physical health of citizens, it also includes longer-term health norms and outcomes, as well as the arena of positive behavior changes. One of the problems of interest is to monitor the activities of daily living (ADL) of the elderly, aiming at their protection and well-being. For this purpose, we installed passive infrared (PIR) sensors to detect motion in a specific area inside a smart apartment and used them to collect a set of ADL. In a novel approach, we describe a technology that allows the ground truth collected in one smart home to train activity recognition systems for other smart homes. We asked the users to label all instances of all ADL only once and subsequently applied data mining techniques to cluster in-home sensor firings. Each cluster would therefore represent the instances of the same activity. Once the clusters were associated to their corresponding activities, our system was able to recognize future activities. To improve the activity recognition accuracy, our system preprocessed raw sensor data by identifying overlapping activities. To evaluate the recognition performance from a 200-day dataset, we implemented three different active learning classification algorithms and compared their performance: naive Bayesian (NB), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). Based on our results, the RF classifier recognized activities with an average specificity of 96.53%, a sensitivity of 68.49%, a precision of 74.41% and an F-measure of 71.33%, outperforming both the NB and SVM classifiers. Further clustering markedly improved the results of the RF classifier. An activity recognition system based on PIR sensors in conjunction with a clustering classification approach was able to detect ADL from datasets collected from different homes. Thus, our PIR-based smart home technology could improve care and provide valuable information to better understand the functioning of our societies, as well as to inform both individual and collective action in a smart city scenario.",https://doi.org/10.3390/S150511725,article

This minimax estimation problem is formulated as an equivalent event-triggered linear exponential quadratic Gaussian problem. It is then shown that this problem can be solved via dynamic programming and a newly defined information state. As the solution to this dynamic programming problem is computationally intractable, a one-step event-triggered minimax estimation problem is further formulated and solved, where an a posteriori relative entropy is introduced as a measure of the discrepancy between probability measures. The resulting estimator is shown to evolve in recursive closed-form expressions. For the multi-sensor system scenario, a one-step event-triggered minimax estimator is also presented in a sequential fusion way. Finally, comparative simulation examples are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed one-step event-triggered minimax estimators.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.automatica.2019.108592,article
"Odendaal, Nancy",2021.0,{Everyday urbanisms and the importance of place: Exploring the elements of the emancipatory smart city,"Two of the most striking features of smart city discourses are the centrality of technology as a driver of transformational change and the strange ‘placelessness' of its visual narrative. Whether envisaged in Kenya or Singapore, the commercial smart city is represented as a ‘city in a box', seemingly capable of solving complex social issues through algorithms and technical innovation. Recently a robust literature has emerged that is critical of the techno-determinism inherent in smart city discussions. This paper expands on this critique by arguing that by solely focusing on the material dimensions of technologically informed urban change, devoid of context, we miss an opportunity to uncover an important moment in contemporary urbanity. By foregrounding the human dimensions of technology appropriation and the interface with livelihoods in their particular spatial contexts, this paper consciously decentres the dominant smart city discourse by arguing for the foregrounding of local dynamics. This paper rejects the universalisms embedded in smart city promises and argues that by provincialising the idea of smart urbanism, opportunities are presented for understanding the true markers of contemporary urbanism. Critical debates on the smart city, and by extension the need to consider smart urbanism contextually and as an infrastructure, relationally, together with the conceptual insights provided by postcolonial science and technology studies, contribute to a proposed frame for researching the ongoing dynamic between contemporary urban life and technological innovation. Empirical vignettes from urban Africa are used to illustrate the multiple dimensions of the interface between livelihoods and technology appropriation.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0042098020970970,article

The results show that: ①economic urbanization and eco-environment pressure make the greatest contributions to the urbanization subsystem and the eco-environment subsystem, respectively; ②compared with the comprehensive development level subsystems, the ratio between $\alpha$-urbanization and $\beta$-eco-environment has little influence on the coupling coordination system; ③the coupling coordination degree evolved from the stage of ""unbalanced development with hindered urbanization"" to ""superiorly balanced development with lagging urbanization"", and then to a stage of ""superiorly balanced development with a lagging eco-environment"".

We use a multi-methods case study approach using two exemplars, a metro project in London and Seoul, which established extensive public transport networks to support urban growth. Our study highlighted that urban transport network expansion does not always enhance life opportunities for all due to intermediate and cumulative impacts of spatial changes induced by projects. Immediate benefits such as enhanced accessibility were often undermined by long-term consequences of incremental spatial changes at local scales. This study also indicated that differential patterns of spatial changes around nodes between centre and periphery could be attributed to multiple negative impacts on people living in the most deprived areas. To enhance social outcomes, we suggest an integrated approach to urban transport and spatial development that focuses on scale and temporal dimensions of spatial transformation enacted by projects. In conclusion, achieving sustainable and equitable effects from urban transport infrastructure requires careful examination of broader societal consequences of long-term spatial changes and locational contexts, especially function and socio-economic conditions.",https://doi.org/10.3390/SU12155907,article

Both practices are primarily geared towards the pursuit of ‘smartness', a prestigious urban adjective that, in the European context, often means receiving an award or large grant from Europe. This article focuses on smart city projects that received European funding, and explores why, how and with what effect for citizen participation these projects are shaped by specific visions for European cities in general, and for European smart cities in particular. It does so by situating these ideas within the intersecting political-economic ambitions of those able to grant ‘smart' (European Research and Innovation Schemes) and those needing to pursue it (post-crisis municipalities). It then illustrates how this political economy results in a discursive production logic that explains why so many smart city projects, that were or want to be successful in European grant applications, tend to exclude the perspective and interests of citizens. The article consequently proposes that politicians, city makers and scientists, who so laudably (cl)aim to position and treat citizens as key stakeholders in European smart cities, reflect more explicitly on their own roles in preserving and challenging this production logic.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.TECHFORE.2018.08.020,article

Thus, the problem is not the existence of technology solutions for smart cities concepts, but how to develop services that will involve citizens to share information about the events in the city. Social psychology theories point out that sense of bellowing, perceived enjoyment, perceived reciprocal benefits, power of knowledge, outcome expectation and perceived status, provides an involvement for citizens to share information and knowledge.

At an organizational level we identify the bureaucratic and technocratic logics underpinning the practices of the governmental agency leading smart city development. Characterized by centralization and the pursuit of efficiency, and framed by a discourse of austerity and financial control, these logics promote a modality of citizen participation that is limited and unidirectional in nature, with citizens positioned largely as users. At a supra-organizational level, we identify a logic of active citizen participation in urban governance that is formalized in city laws. However, this logic is itself entangled in a logic of clientelism and patronage, manifested through networks of power.

Yet, the notion of the 'digital divide' presents significant inequities in terms of who accesses and benefits from the digital landscape. To better understand the social and structural inequities of the digital divide, a realist synthesis was conducted to inform theoretical understandings of information and communication technologies (ICTs); to understand the practicalities of access and use inequities; to uncover practices that facilitate digital literacy and participation; and to recommend policies to mitigate the digital divide.

"Uttal, David H. and Miller, David I. and Newcombe, Nora S.",2013.0,"{Exploring and Enhancing Spatial Thinking: Links to Achievement in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics?","Although neglected in traditional education, spatial thinking plays a critical role in achievement in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. We review this relationship and investigate the malleability of spatial thinking. Can spatial thinking be improved with training, life experience, or educational interventions? Can improving spatial thinking improve STEM achievement? Research indicates that the answer is ""yes"" to both questions. A recent quantitative synthesis of 206 spatial training studies found an average training improvement of 0.47 standard deviations. Training effects lasted for months in studies examining durability and transferred to tasks that differed at least moderately from training tasks. A few studies indicate that spatial training can improve STEM learning, although more research needs to be done on this issue. We argue that including spatial thinking in STEM curricula could substantially increase the number of Americans with the requisite cognitive skills to enter STEM careers. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1177/0963721413484756,article

As societies aim to adopt technologies, there are critical challenges at hand. The digital divide issue has been luring in modern-day society, particularly the various challenges societies face from harnessing the full benefits that Information and Communication Technology can deliver. Unquestionably, an increase in access to enabling technologies has great potential to close the disparities between social groups. This paper presents the results of a systematic review based on the PRISMA protocol that aims to investigate the digital transforming challenges encountered in rural communities within South Africa. The systematic review was conducted using a comprehensive selection of scientific databases as reference sources, allowing access to several related studies. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined and applied to each retrieved article to choose those that satisfy the current study. From 233 retrieved articles, 32 were included. To further understand the main causes of these challenges, three major problems were identified: socio-economic, technology, and politics. Each of the 32 articles was critically studied to understand their findings before grouping them under any of the identified categories. Based on our findings, we highlighted other key challenges and recommendations to enhance ICT adoption and integration into rural areas in South Africa.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.SCIAF.2022.E01190,article

Yet critics contend that the benefits of investment and (re)development programs are not shared equally and there is need for better understanding diverse lived experiences of community members. This paper highlights local voices and lived experiences amid physical and social change in downtown Kitchener, Ontario, Canada, a city that is actively pursuing a smart city agenda. Drawing on data collected from a community workshop that included representatives from local government, technology and start-up sectors, community service providers, and community activists, we adopt a Creative Analytic Practice (CAP) approach and present a set of hybrid vignettes centered on the experiences of these stakeholder groups. The vignettes highlight differing expectations for the role of technology in promoting quality of life and illustrate a struggle to translate aspirations for collaboration and equity into on-the-ground action.

The need to adapt to an increasingly global and dynamic context is fundamental to cities' survival and development trajectories. Nonetheless, how this goal should be met and how the ‘smart' dimension in cities impacts the social, economic and urban levels are still subject to debate. In the present paper, we focus on the relationship between the ‘smart living' dimension, which includes integrative, inclusive and social practices, and the promotion of a local entrepreneurial environment by considering the moderating role of intra- and international human capital inflow. Using a GLS method and a panel dataset that includes 30 cities, we demonstrate that the relationship tends to be an inverted U-shaped curve, contributing to the discussion on the impact of smart cities' social policies on entrepreneurship in urban contexts. Furthermore, we highlight that human capital inflow positively moderates this relationship, showing that intra- and international human capital flows contribute differently in this regard, producing divergent effects.

Close to USD 93 billion is needed to finance urban development in Africa. The prevalence of COVID-19 pandemic impacted negatively on the independence of African cities to raise revenue or incur long-term debt to finance their development. Several local governments in African cities are not positioned enough to ensure quality standards of living for their people. This is because many local authorities in African cities cannot intervene in various emergencies or crises which pose a danger to people given the COVID-19 pandemic era where strategic government interventions are essential to save the lives of the people. Burdened by the need to respond to COVID-19, many African governments have diverted their attention from the smart city ideology which demands stable financial revenues and redirected their efforts towards mitigating the scourge of the pandemic. Drawing from this background, therefore this chapter reports on the three selected African cities (Johannesburg, Lagos and Accra) because of their experiences regarding COVID-19, and their responses to the pandemic towards achieving a smart city in Africa. The chapter is guided by the following specific objectives: To examine the unintended consequences of COVID-19 on the achievement of Smart Cities in three African Cities; to assess the opportunities and challenges of achieving smart cities amid COVID 19 in three African Cities; and to determine how rapid urbanisation affects the achievement of Smart Cities amid COVID-19 in three African Cities.

This concept becomes even more relevant in situations of global crisis such as that arising from COVID-19. Since this pandemic there have been tectonic shifts in the education sector. Effective implementation of e-learning in higher education depends on students' adoption of this technology. So, this study aimed to identify the factors influencing the behavioral intentions and actual usage of students in adopting e-learning. Additionally, it also examined the mediation effects among different latent constructs. Based on technology acceptance model (TAM), an explanatory structural model of technology acceptance was tested along with introduction of three external variables. To do this, a quantitative investigation was conducted using an online survey of higher education students in India, obtaining 570 responses. The structural model was examined through the partial least square structural equation modeling. Results obtained make it possible to validate the proposed model as findings explains the 56.2% variance of actual usage. In addition, it shows the direct and indirect effect of all three selected external variables of personal innovativeness, social factors and self-efficacy on the main constructs of TAM.

It aims to contribute with further understanding of the importance of citizen participation and involvement within the e-government research body of knowledge and when developing public e-services in practice. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis in the paper is made from a comparative, qualitative case study of two e-government projects. Three analysis themes are induced from the literature review; practice of participation, incentives for participation, and organization of participation. These themes are guiding the comparative analysis of our data with a concurrent openness to interpretations from the field. Findings: The main results in this paper are that the e-government field can get inspiration and learn from methods and approaches in traditional IS projects concerning user participation, but in e-government, methods are also needed to handle the challenges that arise when designing public e-services for large, heterogeneous user groups. Citizen engagement cannot be seen as a separate challenge in e-government, but rather as an integrated part of the process of organizing, managing, and performing e-government projects. Analysis themes of participation generated from literature; practice, incentives and organization can be used in order to highlight, analyze, and discuss main issues regarding the challenges of citizen participation within e-government. This is an important implication based on this paper that contributes both to theory on and practice of e-government. Practical implications: Lessons to learn from this paper concern that many e-government projects have a public e-service as one outcome and an internal e-administration system as another outcome. A dominating internal, agency perspective in such projects might imply that citizens as the user group of the e-service are only seen as passive receivers of the outcome - not as active participants in the development. By applying the analysis themes, proposed in this paper, citizens as active participants can be thoroughly discussed when initiating (or evaluating) an e-government project. Originality/value: The paper addresses challenges regarding citizen participation in e-government development projects. User participation is well researched within the IS discipline, but the e-government setting implies new challenges that are not explored enough. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1108/17506161011081309,article

Warm-glow is the feeling of satisfaction or pleasure (or both) that is experienced by individuals after they do something “good” for their fellow human. Two constructs—perceived extrinsic warm-glow (PEWG) and perceived intrinsic warm-glow (PIWG)—were incorporated into the TAM3 model to measure the two dimensions of user-experienced warm-glow, forming what we refer to as the TAM3 + WG model. An experimental approach was taken to evaluate the suitability of the proposed model (i.e., TAM3 + WG). A vignette was created to present users with a hypothetical technology designed to evoke warm-glow in participants. Our TAM3 + WG model was found to be superior in terms of fit to the TAM3 model. Furthermore, the PEWG and PIWG constructs were confirmed to be unique within the original TAM3 model. The findings indicate that the factors that have the greatest influence on consumer decisions are (in decreasing order) perceived usefulness (PU), PIWG, subjective norm (SN), and PEWG. Additionally, a higher PEWG resulted in the technology being perceived as more useful. In other words, both extrinsic and intrinsic warm-glow play a prominent role in user decisions as to whether or not to adopt a particular technology.",https://doi.org/10.3390/INFO13090429,article

These two models, the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the task-technology fit model (TTF), provide a much needed theoretical basis for exploring the factors that explain software utilization and its link with user performance. These models offer different, though overlapping perspectives on utilization behavior. TAM focuses on attitudes toward using a particular IT which users develop based on perceived usefulness and ease of use of the IT. TTF focuses on the match between user task needs and the available functionality of the IT. While each of these models offers significant explanatory power, a model that integrates constructs from both may offer a significant improvement over either model alone. We discuss the theoretical foundation of both these models and present a theoretical rationale for an integrated model. The result is an extension of TAM to include TTF constructs. We test our integrated IT utilization model using path analysis. Our integrated model provides more explanatory power than either model alone.

The key feature that distinguishes the FC paradigm for smart cities is that it spreads communication and computing resources over the wired/wireless access network (e.g., proximate access points and base stations) to provide resource augmentation (e.g., cyberforaging) for resource- and energy-limited wired/wireless (possibly mobile) things. Motivated by these considerations, this paper presents a Fog-supported smart city network architecture called Fog Computing Architecture Network (FOCAN), a multi-tier structure in which the applications are running on things thatjointly compute, route, and communicate with one another through the smart city environment. FOCAN decreases latency and improves energy provisioning and the efficiency of services among things with different capabilities. In particular, three types of communications are defined between FOCAN devices – interprimary, primary, and secondary communication –to manage applications in a way that meets the quality of service standards for the Internet of Everything. One of the main advantages of the proposed architecture is that the devices can provide the services with low energy usage and in an efficient manner. Simulation results for a selected case study demonstrate the tremendous impact of the FOCAN energy-efficient solution on the communication performance of various types of things in smart cities.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.JPDC.2018.07.003,article

One of the first critical steps toward understanding these aspects of Malaysian smart cities is to empirically study the citizens' and government agencies' aspirations to use smart city services. A Malaysia Smart Cities Stakeholders Adoption Model (MSCSA) as a case study based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) is being developed and evaluated in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. An in-depth interview with expert staff from the Plan Malaysia smart city department and Telekom Malaysia Berhad (TM one) was conducted using a mixed-methods approach. To determine the influence of seven parameters on behavioural intentions, specifically the choice to build a smart city, quantitative data were collected as questionnaires. These parameters were self-efficacy, expected effort, perceived security, perceived privacy, price value, trust in government, and trust in technology. Citizens' intentions to use smart city services were significantly influenced by each of these characteristics. There is a definite association between perceived privacy and perceived security as a core aspect of trust in technology, as well as price value, a core aspect of trust in government. When the trust in both these is strong, stakeholders are more willing to adopt and pursue smart city services. These studies provide city officials with a technique for measuring citizen desire for smart city services, as well as outlining the components necessary for establishing a good smart city strategy that is successful.",https://doi.org/10.3390/SMARTCITIES5040077,article

Design/methodology/approach: Following previous research on e-government services adoption, this study employs the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model to examine the influential factors of the adoption and use of e-government services in Pakistan from a citizen perspective. An online survey was conducted and a statistical descriptive analysis was performed on the responses received from 115 Pakistani citizens. Findings: In line with previous research, the findings show that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions and social influence are the factors that affect the user's adoption of e-government services in Pakistan. Furthermore, the results show that lack of awareness, user data privacy, lack of appropriate support and assistance hamper the process. Practical implications: The findings are useful for policy-makers and decision-makers to develop a better understanding of citizens' needs. The adopted model can be used as a guideline for the implementation of e-government services in Pakistan. This study suggests that government should run extensive advertising campaigns to ensure that people are aware of the services and use them. This implies that government should place emphasis on increasing awareness of the services, show the benefits of citizens, and encouraging confidence in the system. Originality/value: This study is one of the few to examine what influences citizens adoption of e-government services in South Asia. This paper is the first step exploring end-user adoption of the e-government services of Pakistan using UTAUT model. Corresponding to previous research, this study enforces the significance of particular factors that need to be considered when the goal is to increase e-government services adoption in developing countries, particularly South Asian. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1108/17506161311325378,article
"Bolarinwa, Obasanjo Afolabi",2021.0,{Factors associated with access to condoms and sources of condoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa,"Background: Evidence has shown that the prescribed lockdown and physical distancing due to the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have made accessing essential health care services much more difficult in low-and middle-income countries. Access to contraception is an essential service and should not be denied, even in a global crisis, because of its associated health benefits. Therefore, it is important to maintain timely access to contraception without unnecessary barriers. Hence, this study examines the factors contributing to limited access to condoms and sources of condoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa. Methods: This study used the National Income Dynamics Study-Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey (NIDS-CRAM) wave 1 survey dataset. The NIDS-CRAM is a nationally representative survey of the National Income Dynamics Survey (NIDS) conducted via telephone interview during COVID-19 in the year 2020. This is the first secondary dataset on COVID-19 conducted by NIDS during pandemic. A total of 5304 respondents were included in the study. Data were analysed using frequencies distribution percentages, chi-square test and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results: Almost one-quarter (22.40%) of South Africans could not access condoms, and every 7 in 10 South Africans preferred public source of condoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Those who were from other population groups [AOR = 0.37; 95% CI = 0.19–0.74] and those who were in the third wealth quintile [AOR = 0.60; 95% CI = 0.38–0.93] had lower odds of having access to condoms while those respondents who were aged 25–34 [AOR = 0.48; 95% CI = 0.27–0.83] and those with a secondary level of education and above [AOR = 0.24; 95% CI = 0.08–0.71] were less likely to prefer public source of condom. Conclusions: This study concludes that there was limited access to condoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and that the preferred source of condoms was very skewed to public sources in South Africa. Strategic interventions such as community distribution of free condoms to avert obstruction of condom access during the COVID-19 pandemic or any future pandemics should be adopted.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13690-021-00701-5,article

The technology has been around for sometimes, but its prevalence is not yet widespread, and thus the potentials have largely been underestimated. The purpose of this paper is to develop a comprehensive model that can explain a large percentage of variance in the intention to use smart home technology. To do so, this paper, based on technology acceptance model, diffusion of innovation theory and consumer perceived innovativeness, proposes an integrated model and validates it through Structural Equation Modelling on data collected from 156 respondents. The results reveal that compatibility, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are important determinants affecting the adoption of smart home technology. Moreover, trialability while show no direct effect on the intention to use, its affect is realized indirectly via constructs of PU and PEoU. The SEM results also show that the perceived cost negatively impacts the intention to use.

Through a digital government lens, we first elaborate the nature of multi-stakeholder collaboration in the smart city. Then, we adopt a contingency approach to unpack the factors that affect the intensity of collaboration between the stakeholders in the smart city ecosystem. To characterize the ecosystem, we use the quadruple-helix framework. Through the perspective of the local government, we derive hypotheses on whether certain factors lead to more intensive collaboration, which are tested on a sample of Belgian municipalities. Our findings reveal the importance of smart city strategies for intensifying collaboration between the local government and stakeholders in the ecosystem.

As a wide variety and large number of passive monitoring systems are currently and increasingly available to detect when individuals have fallen, there is a need to analyze and synthesize the evidence regarding their ability to accurately detect falls to determine which systems are most effective. Objectives: The purpose of this literature review is to systematically assess the current state of design and implementation of fall-detection devices. This review also examines to what extent these devices have been tested in the real world as well as the acceptability of these devices to older adults. Data Sources: A systematic literature review was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycINFO from their respective inception dates to June 25, 2013. Study Eligibility Criteria and Interventions: Articles were included if they discussed a project or multiple projects involving a system with the purpose of detecting a fall in adults. It was not a requirement for inclusion in this review that the system targets persons older than 65 years. Articles were excluded if they were not written in English or if they looked at fall risk, fall detection in children, fall prevention, or a personal emergency response device. Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods: Studies were initially divided into those using sensitivity, specificity, or accuracy in their evaluation methods and those using other methods to evaluate their devices. Studies were further classified into wearable devices and nonwearable devices. Studies were appraised for inclusion of older adults in sample and if evaluation included real-world settings. Results: This review identified 57 projects that used wearable systems and 35 projects using nonwearable systems, regardless of evaluation technique. Nonwearable systems included cameras, motion sensors, microphones, and fl oor sensors. Of the projects examining wearable systems, only 7.1% reported monitoring older adults in a real-world setting. There were no studies of nonwearable devices that used older adults as subjects in either a laboratory or a real-world setting. In general, older adults appear to be interested in using such devices although they express concerns over privacy and understanding exactly what the device is doing at specific times. Limitations: This systematic review was limited to articles written in English and did not include gray literature. Manual paper screening and review processes may have been subject to interpretive bias. Conclusions and Implications of Key Findings: There exists a large body of work describing various fall-detection devices. The challenge in this area is to create highly accurate unobtrusive devices. From this review it appears that the technology is becoming more able to accomplish such a task.

An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features - using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model [3], our detection system has a frame rate of 5 fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image.

"Kron, Wolfgang",2005.0,{Flood risk = hazard • values • vulnerability,"Worldwide, flooding is probably the number one cause of losses from natural events. No region in the world is safe from being flooded. As the flood risk is a function of the flood hazard, the exposed values and their vulnerability, the increase in flood losses must be attributed to changes in each of these aspects. While flood protection measures may reduce the frequency of inundation losses, appropriate preparedness measures lessen the residual financial risk considerably. Besides public and private measures, insurance is a key factor in reducing the financial risk for individuals, enterprises, and even whole societies. In recent years, the demand for flood insurance has been growing. This is forcing the insurance industry to develop appropriate solutions. At the same time it is vital for the insurers to know the probable maximum losses they might face as the result of an extreme event. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1080/02508060508691837,article

Flood inundation models are fundamental for reproducing the boundaries of flood-prone areas, but their calibration is limited to the information available on the areas affected by inundation during observed flood events (typically fragmentary photo, video or partial surveys). In recent years, Earth Observation data have supported flood monitoring and emergency response (e.g., the Copernicus Emergency Service) thanks to the proliferation of available satellite sensors, also at high spatial resolution. Under this umbrella, the study investigates a levee breach that occurred in December 2017 along the Enza River, a right tributary of the Po River, that caused the inundation of a large area including Lentigione village. The flood event is simulated with a 2D hydraulic model using satellite images to calibrate the roughness coefficients. The results show that the processing and the timing of the high-resolution satellite imagery is fundamental for a reliable representation of the flooded area.",https://doi.org/10.3390/W15091644,article

However, because of their complementary features, we expect that their integration can foster a number of computing and network-intensive pervasive applications under the incoming realm of the future Internet. Motivated by this consideration, the goal of this position paper is fivefold. First, we review the technological attributes and platforms proposed in the current literature for the standing-alone FC and IoE paradigms. Second, by leveraging some use cases as illustrative examples, we point out that the integration of the FC and IoE paradigms may give rise to opportunities for new applications in the realms of the IoE, Smart City, Industry 4.0, and Big Data Streaming, while introducing new open issues. Third, we propose a novel technological paradigm, the Fog of Everything (FoE) paradigm, that integrates FC and IoE and then we detail the main building blocks and services of the corresponding technological platform and protocol stack. Fourth, as a proof-of-concept, we present the simulated energy-delay performance of a small-scale FoE prototype, namely, the V-FoE prototype. Afterward, we compare the obtained performance with the corresponding one of a benchmark technological platform, e.g., the V-D2D one. It exploits only device-to-device links to establish inter-thing 'ad hoc' communication.

OBJECTIVE:We introduce an algorithm to model and forecast wake and sleep behaviors that are exhibited by the participant. Furthermore, we propose that sleep behavior is impacted by and can be modeled from wake behavior, and vice versa. METHODS: This paper describes the Behavior Forecasting (BF) algorithm. BF consists of 1) defining numeric values that reflect sleep and wake behavior, 2) forecasting wake and sleep values from past behavior, 3) analyzing the effect of wake behavior on sleep and vice versa, and 4) improving prediction performance by using both wake and sleep scores. RESULTS: The BF method was evaluated with data collected from 20 smart homes. We found that regardless of the forecasting method utilized, wake behavior and sleep behavior can be modeled with a minimum accuracy of 84%. Additionally, normalizing the wake and sleep scores drastically improves the accuracy to 99%. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that we can effectively model wake and sleep behaviors in a smart environment. Furthermore, wake behaviors can be predicted from sleep behaviors and vice versa.",https://doi.org/10.3233/THC-161255,article

Therefore, the ability to forecast and characterize building energy consumption is vital to implementing urban energy management and efficiency initiatives required to curb emissions. Advances in smart metering technology have enabled researchers to develop ""sensor based"" approaches to forecast building energy consumption that necessitate less input data than traditional methods. Sensor-based forecasting utilizes machine learning techniques to infer the complex relationships between consumption and influencing variables (e.g., weather, time of day, previous consumption). While sensor-based forecasting has been studied extensively for commercial buildings, there is a paucity of research applying this data-driven approach to the multi-family residential sector. In this paper, we build a sensor-based forecasting model using Support Vector Regression (SVR), a commonly used machine learning technique, and apply it to an empirical data-set from a multi-family residential building in New York City. We expand our study to examine the impact of temporal (i.e., daily, hourly, 10min intervals) and spatial (i.e., whole building, by floor, by unit) granularity have on the predictive power of our single-step model. Results indicate that sensor based forecasting models can be extended to multi-family residential buildings and that the optimal monitoring granularity occurs at the by floor level in hourly intervals. In addition to implications for the development of residential energy forecasting models, our results have practical significance for the deployment and installation of advanced smart metering devices. Ultimately, accurate and cost effective wide-scale energy prediction is a vital step towards next-generation energy efficiency initiatives, which will require not only consideration of the methods, but the scales for which data can be distilled into meaningful information. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.APENERGY.2014.02.057,article

"Diez, Luis and Choque, Johnny and Sanchez, Luis and Munoz, Luis",2020.0,{Fostering IoT Service Replicability in Interoperable Urban Ecosystems,"Worldwide cities are involved in a digital transformation phase specially focused on sustainability and improving citizen's quality of life. However, such objectives are hard to achieve if the migration of the urban processes are not performed following a common approach. Under the paradigm of smart city, different Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have been deployed over urban environments to enable such digital transformation. However, actual implementations differ from one city to another, and even between services within the same city. As a consequence, the deployment of urban services is hindered, since they need to be tailored to each city. In addition, the isolation of urban services obstructs its optimization, since it cannot harness contextual information coming from other services. All in all, it is necessary to implement tools and mechanisms that allow us to ensure that city solutions and their vertical services are interoperable. In order to tackle this issue, different initiatives have proposed architectures that homogenize the interaction with smart cities from different angles. However, so far the compliance with such architectures has not been assessed. Having this in mind, in this work we present a validation framework, developed under the umbrella of the SynchroniCity project, which aims to verify that interfaces and data exposed by cities are aligned with the adopted standards and data models. In this regard, the validation framework presented here is the technical enabler for the creation of an interoperability certificate for smart cities. To assess the benefits of the validation framework, we have used it to check the interoperability of 21 smart city deployments worldwide that adhered the SynchroniCity guidelines. Afterwards, during an open call a total number of 37 services have been deployed over such SynchroniCity instances, thus confirming the goodness of uniform and validated smart cities to foster service replicability.",https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3046286,article

Smarter Cities are urban areas that exploit operational data, such as that arising from traffic congestion, power consumption statistics, and public safety events, to optimize the operation of city services. The foundational concepts are instrumented, interconnected, and intelligent. Instrumented refers to sources of near-real-time real-world data from both physical and virtual sensors. Interconnected means the integration of those data into an enterprise computing platform and the communication of such information among the various city services. Intelligent refers to the inclusion of complex analytics, modeling, optimization, and visualization in the operational business processes to make better operational decisions. This approach enables the adaptation of city services to the behavior of the inhabitants, which permits the optimal use of the available physical infrastructure and resources, for example, in sensing and controlling consumption of energy and water, managing waste processing and transportation systems, and applying optimization to achieve new efficiencies among these resources. Additional roles exist in intelligent interaction between the city and its inhabitants and further contribute to operational efficiency while maintaining or enhancing quality of life. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1147/JRD.2010.2048257,article

Historically, the economy of Malaysia was based on agriculture and natural resources. In its efforts to transform Malaysia to a developed and industrialized country, the government started to focus on industry and high technology in the 1980s. A key area of focus was Information Technology (IT). The government chose to adopt several policies with respect to the supply and demand sides of IT instead of a national IT plan1. The policies addressed IT infrastructure, education and training, research and development, use of IT in the public sector, and fiscal incentives. These IT policies and the broad economic and industrial policies implemented during this period had a positive influence on demand for IT products and services, number of IT professionals, number of telephones per 100 population, and IT production and use.

Generally, these focus on advancing students' skills in using ‘educational' applications and digitally-sourced information, or understanding effective blends of pedagogical, content and technological knowledge seen as supporting the integration of digital resources into teaching, to enhance subject learning outcomes. Within teacher education institutions courses developing these capabilities are commonly delivered as standalone entities, or there is an assumption that they will be generated by technology's integration in other disciplines or through mandated assessment. However, significant research exists suggesting the current narrow focus on subject-related technical and information skills does not prepare students adequately with the breadth of knowledge and capabilities needed in today's classrooms, and beyond. This article presents a conceptual framework introducing an expanded view of teacher digital competence (TDC).

Second, citizens expect governments to act proactively by initiating appropriate government services themselves, instead of relying on requests for services from citizens. To address these two issues, this paper proposes a transition from a one-stop shop to a no-stop shop, where the citizen does not have to perform any action or fill in any forms to receive government services. The contribution of this paper is an e-government stage model that extends existing models. Stage models are suitable tools with which to inspire future developments, and ours extends previous models that guide progress toward the one-stop shop by describing two further stages: the limited no-stop shop and the no-stop shop. We define three dimensions along which to progress: integration of data collection, integration of data storage, and purpose of data use.

Tracking these promises and ideas, this paper explores “smart urbanism” in ten cities from all over Israel. Based on interviews with leading figures in municipalities, smart city consultants and key figures in technological companies (n = 40), the aims of this paper are to assess the efforts of cities to become smart by responding to the following questions: 1. What is guiding the decision-making process in developing technological initiatives? 2. Does context play a role in implementing technological initiatives? 3. How are the residents perceived, and what tools are being used to address residents' digital differences? The key argument of this paper is threefold: first, in the process of becoming a smart city, the roles of public and private actors are blurred, influencing the process of decision making. Second, despite contextual differences, cities adopt similar digital initiatives. Third, technological initiatives that focus on social needs and address inequality in the digital age are still at the margins. The final discussion suggests that most municipalities are still at an early stage of digitization implementation and have the ability to shape and form a vision for the cities as socio-technological ecosystems in a way that will serve their publics as a whole.

"Glynn, Mary Ann and Lounsbury, Michael",2005.0,"{From the critics corner: Logic blending, discursive change and authenticity in a cultural production system","Drawing on an analysis of critics' reviews of Atlanta Symphony Orchestra (ASO) performances, we investigate how broader shifts in institutional logics shape the discourse of critics and their judgment of performances. We highlight how the aesthetic logic that traditionally informs the practices of the symphony yielded, in the face of declining orchestral resources, to a more commercially oriented market logic. As institutionalists have argued, shifts in logics are often catalysed by exogenous shocks. In the ASO, this blending of aesthetic and market logics became salient in the wake of a pivotal organizational event, the 1996 musicians' strike. Qualitatively comparing pre- and post-strike reviews of ASO performances, we find that the discourse of critics shifted to capture the changing logic of the symphony: post-strike reviews were more attuned to market than aesthetic aspects of the symphony. Nonetheless, their reviews suggested that judgments based on notions of cultural authenticity were virtually unaffected. Although our results echo existing claims that art world critics often act in a ritualistic fashion, serving as gatekeepers for the authenticity of cultural genres, we extend scholarship by highlighting how critics' stories are embedded in broader discursive fields that reveal how they patrol the boundaries of genres. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1467-6486.2005.00531.X,article

A full extended layerwise method (Full-XLWM) is developed in this study to avoid the dependence of the delamination region on the finite elements. In the Full-XLWM, the delamination is simulated by the Heaviside function and branch function of the displacement field in the thickness direction, whilst transverse cracks are modeled by the extended finite element method (XFEM). The weak discontinuous function along the thickness direction is adopted to consider the interlaminar interfaces. The delamination front is independent on the meshing as the level set function is employed, so the analysis model of delamination can be established from a uniform finite element meshing.

However, evolution of these trends as the pandemic progresses remains unknown. More certain are the devastating longterm impacts of the pandemic on health and development evident globally. Research tailored to the unique needs of African countries is crucial. UKCDR and GloPID-R have launched a tracker of funded COVID-19 projects mapped to the WHO research priorities and research priorities of Africa and less-resourced countries and published a baseline analysis of a living systematic review (LSR) of these projects. Methods: In-depth analyses of the baseline LSR for COVID-19 funded research projects in Africa (as of 15th July 2020) to determine the funding landscape and alignment of the projects to research priorities of relevance to Africa. Results: The limited COVID-19 related research across Africa appears to be supported mainly by international funding, especially from Europe, although with notably limited funding from United Statesbased funders. At the time of this analysis no research projects funded by an African-based funder were identified in the tracker although there are several active funding calls geared at research in Africa and there may be funding data that has not been made publicly available. Many projects mapped to the WHO research priorities and five particular gaps in research funding were identified, namely: investigating the role of children in COVID-19 transmission; effective modes of community engagement; health systems research; communication of uncertainties surrounding mother-to-child transmission of COVID-19; and identifying ways to promote international cooperation. Capacity strengthening was identified as a dominant theme in funded research project plans.

While environmental regulation has been shown to be an important driver of green innovation, little is known about whether other types of polices, such as financial incentives, technical and marketing supports, and assistance with identifying potential markets, are important to firms of all sizes at different stages of the green innovation process (i.e., at product/service launch vs. product/service expansion). Using data from the European Commission, the results show that policy support to identify markets or customers is deemed important by firms of all sizes to introduce green goods and services. However, this support is no longer perceived as important to expand firms' green portfolio. This suggests firms capitalise by using their existing markets or customers. The results do not lend support to the view of small firms as the most resource constrained and hence needing the greatest policy supports.

This experience is measured by period of time using a computer and self-perceived computer and Internet experience. Further analyses on the impact of gender on this correlation of ICT experience and ICT attitudes were conducted by means of a multivariate model. General Linear Model (GLM) analysis revealed that there was a significant effect of gender, computer use, and self-perceived computer experience on computer anxiety attitudes, as well as several significant interaction effects. Males were found to have less computer anxiety than females; respondents who have used computers for a longer period of time and respondents with a higher self-perception of experience also show less computer anxiety. However, the GLM plot shows that the influence of computer experience works in different ways for males and females. Computer experience has a positive impact on decreasing computer anxiety for men, but a similar effect was not found for women.

It is unclear whether these differences can be explained by the varying circumstances in which different generations grew up or by other factors that vary within an individual's life time. This article tests a model which proposes that generation determines the level of Internet use and life stage determines gender differences in Internet use. Descriptive analyses of a representative sample of 1,578 British Internet users confirm that there continue to be small but significant gender differences for most uses of the Internet. The findings from a series of linear regressions suggest that gender differences vary for different life stages related to occupation and marital status. This is true especially for typically male uses.

Undoubtedly, sustainable development has, since its widespread diffusion in the early 1990s, positively influenced city planning and development. This pertains to the immense opportunities that have been explored and the enormous benefits that have been realized in relation to sustainable urban forms, especially compact cities and eco-cities. However, such forms are still associated with a number of problems, issues, and challenges. This mainly involves the question of how they should be monitored, understood, analyzed, and planned to improve, advance, and maintain their contribution to sustainability and thus to overcome the kind of wicked problems, unsettled issues, and complex challenges they embody. This in turn brings us to the current question related to the weak connection between and the extreme fragmentation of sustainable cities and smart cities as approaches and landscapes, respectively, despite the proven role of advanced ICT, coupled with the untapped potential of big data technology and its novel applications, in supporting sustainable cities as to enhancing and optimizing their performance under what is labeled “smart sustainable cities.” In this respect, there has recently been a conscious push for sustainable cities to become smart and thus more sustainable by particularly embracing what big data technology and its novel applications has to offer in the hopes of reaching the optimal level of sustainability. In the meantime, we are in the midst of an expansion of time horizons in city planning and development. In this context, sustainable cities across the globe have adopted ambitious smart goals that extend far into the future.

"Coghlan, Simon and Miller, Tim and Paterson, Jeannie",2021.0,{Good Proctor or “Big Brother”? Ethics of Online Exam Supervision Technologies,"Online exam supervision technologies have recently generated significant controversy and concern. Their use is now booming due to growing demand for online courses and for off-campus assessment options amid COVID-19 lockdowns. Online proctoring technologies purport to effectively oversee students sitting online exams by using artificial intelligence (AI) systems supplemented by human invigilators. Such technologies have alarmed some students who see them as a “Big Brother-like” threat to liberty and privacy, and as potentially unfair and discriminatory. However, some universities and educators defend their judicious use. Critical ethical appraisal of online proctoring technologies is overdue. This essay provides one of the first sustained moral philosophical analyses of these technologies, focusing on ethical notions of academic integrity, fairness, non-maleficence, transparency, privacy, autonomy, liberty, and trust. Most of these concepts are prominent in the new field of AI ethics, and all are relevant to education. The essay discusses these ethical issues. It also offers suggestions for educational institutions and educators interested in the technologies about the kinds of inquiries they need to make and the governance and review processes they might need to adopt to justify and remain accountable for using online proctoring technologies. The rapid and contentious rise of proctoring software provides a fruitful ethical case study of how AI is infiltrating all areas of life. The social impacts and moral consequences of this digital technology warrant ongoing scrutiny and study.",https://doi.org/10.1007/S13347-021-00476-1,article

W.",2020.0,"{Good residents, bad residents: How participatory processes in urban redevelopment privilege entrepreneurial citizens","While participatory processes in urban development are meant to increase citizen influence, decades of experimentation have led to mixed results. In this article we answer two inter-related questions: (1) How are “citizens' interests” defined in agreements that manage urban redevelopment projects? (2) When—under what conditions—are citizens able to alter the trajectory of urban development? By analyzing cases through the concept of “pragmatic registers”, we show how residents, developers and civil servants can bend citizen participation—and its material arrangements from workshops and public meetings to contracts and policy documents—to serve their own purposes. The organizational and legal tools used in urban planning, we argue, privilege entrepreneurial citizens who are active, flexible and possess negotiating know-how. Participatory processes (re)produce moral categories, with entrepreneurial residents seen as the “good” residents who henceforth become the focus of urban policy. These categories, however, can be challenged by other residents who mobilize support from politicians, the media and courts. This in turn sparks new debates about who truly represents the neighborhood, creating new boundaries between residents.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.CITIES.2020.102898,article

The final goal is to improve the quality of city life for all stakeholders. Until now, SCs have been developing as bottom-up projects, bringing together smart initiatives driven by public bodies, enterprises, citizens, and not-for-profit organizations. However, to build a long-term smart strategy capable of producing better returns from investments and deciding priorities regarding each city, a comprehensive SC governance framework is needed. The aim of this paper is to collect empirical evidences regarding government structures implemented in SCs and to outline a framework for the roles of local governments, nongovernmental agencies, and administrative officials. The survey shows that no consolidated standards or best practices for governing SCs are implemented in the examined cities; however, each city applies its own governance framework.

This article brings some structure to the debate by analyzing a corpus of 51 publications and mapping their variation. The analysis shows that publications differ in their emphasis on (1) smart technology, smart people or smart collaboration as the defining features of smart cities, (2) a transformative or incremental perspective on changes in urban governance, (3) better outcomes or a more open process as the legitimacy claim for smart city governance. We argue for a comprehensive perspective: smart city governance is about crafting new forms of human collaboration through the use of ICTs to obtain better outcomes and more open governance processes. Research into smart city governance could benefit from previous studies into success and failure factors for e-government and build upon sophisticated theories of socio-technical change. This article highlights that smart city governance is not a technological issue: we should study smart city governance as a complex process of institutional change and acknowledge the political nature of appealing visions of socio-technical governance. Points for practitioners: The study provides practitioners with an in-depth understanding of current debates about smart city governance. The article highlights that governing a smart city is about crafting new forms of human collaboration through the use of information and communication technologies.

In this article, we theorize and analyze whether governments with an extremely low or extremely high technological capacity are more likely to collaborate with third-party platforms in order to jointly provide digital services. We expect there to be a U-shaped relationship between the technological capacity of those governments and their public–private partnership choices. An empirical analysis of digital service delivery across 290 prefecture-level cities in China corroborates this hypothesis. These results deepen our understanding of the competing motivations that drive the public–private partnership process. Points for practitioners: Public–private collaboration has been widely adopted to promote digital service delivery. This article confirms the U-shaped relationship between government technological capacity and public–private collaboration in digital service delivery at the city level. To encourage the collaboration, it is crucial to target governments with varying capacities, which seems to be easier in large cities with high administrative rank and that are overall technologically mature and in a competitive environment technologically.",https://doi.org/10.1177/00208523211018849,article

This study extends an earlier exploratory study showing that more green space in deprived urban neighbourhoods in Scotland is linked to lower levels of perceived stress and improved physiological stress as measured by diurnal patterns of cortisol secretion. Salivary cortisol concentrations were measured at 3, 6 and 9 h post awakening over two consecutive weekdays, together with measures of perceived stress. Participants (n = 106) were men and women not in work aged between 35-55 years, resident in socially disadvantaged districts from the same Scottish, UK, urban context as the earlier study. Results from linear regression analyses showed a significant and negative relationship between higher green space levels and stress levels, indicating living in areas with a higher percentage of green space is associated with lower stress, confirming the earlier study findings. This study further extends the findings by showing significant gender differences in stress patterns by levels of green space, with women in lower green space areas showing higher levels of stress. A significant interaction effect between gender and percentage green space on mean cortisol concentrations showed a positive effect of higher green space in relation to cortisol measures in women, but not in men. Higher levels of neighbourhood green space were associated with healthier mean cortisol levels in women whilst also attenuating higher cortisol levels in men. We conclude that higher levels of green space in residential neighbourhoods, for this deprived urban population of middle-aged men and women not in work, are linked with lower perceived stress and a steeper (healthier) diurnal cortisol decline. However, overall patterns and levels of cortisol secretion in men and women were differentially related to neighbourhood green space and warrant further investigation. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.3390/IJERPH10094086,article
"Bettencourt, Lu{\'{i",2007.0,"{Growth, innovation, scaling, and the pace of life in cities","Humanity has just crossed a major landmark in its history with the majority of people now living in cities. Cities have long been known to be society's predominant engine of innovation and wealth creation, yet they are also its main source of crime, pollution, and disease. The inexorable trend toward urbanization worldwide presents an urgent challenge for developing a predictive, quantitative theory of urban organization and sustainable development. Here we present empirical evidence indicating that the processes relating urbanization to economic development and knowledge creation are very general, being shared by all cities belonging to the same urban system and sustained across different nations and times. Many diverse properties of cities from patent production and personal income to electrical cable length are shown to be power law functions of population size with scaling exponents, $\beta$, that fall into distinct universality classes. Quantities reflecting wealth creation and innovation have $\beta$ ≈ = 1.2 > 1 (increasing returns), whereas those accounting for infrastructure display $\beta$ ≈0.8 < 1 (economies of scale). We predict that the pace of social life in the city increases with population size, in quantitative agreement with data, and we discuss how cities are similar to, and differ from, biological organisms, for which $\beta$ < 1. Finally, we explore possible consequences of these scaling relations by deriving growth equations, which quantify the dramatic difference between growth fueled by innovation versus that driven by economies of scale. This difference suggests that, as population grows, major innovation cycles must be generated at a continually accelerating rate to sustain growth and avoid stagnation or collapse. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0610172104,article

This paper aims to give a broad overview of her spatial thinking. More precisely, it presents the various spatial concepts Arendt uses (place, space, territory, world, location, etc.), and suggests that a tri-partite spatial ontology is at work behind her lexicon. Since such an ontological trilogy is never explicit in Arendt's work, it is compared to the architecture of Arendt's explicit theorization which is structured around different sets of concepts (identity/plurality; labour/work/action). Then, the paper explains that an ontological analysis of Arendt's proposals allows us to understand the major issues or tragedies that she focused on as being related to tensions between different forms of spatiality.

There is limited evidence that green or natural environments are positive for physical and mental health and wellbeing. We present a new and unique primary research study exploring the relationship between momentary subjective wellbeing (SWB) and individuals' immediate environment within the UK. We developed and applied an innovative data collection tool: a smartphone app that signals participants at random moments, presenting a brief questionnaire while using satellite positioning (GPS) to determine geographical coordinates. We used this to collect over one million responses from more than 20,000 participants. Associating GPS response locations with objective spatial data, we estimate a model relating land cover to SWB using only the within-individual variation, while controlling for weather, daylight, activity, companionship, location type, time, day, and any response trend. On average, study participants are significantly and substantially happier outdoors in all green or natural habitat types than they are in urban environments. These findings are robust to a number of alternative models and model specifications. This study provides a new line of evidence on links between nature and wellbeing, strengthening existing evidence of a positive relationship between SWB and exposure to green or natural environments in daily life. Our results have informed the UK National Ecosystem Assessment (NEA), and the novel geo-located experience sampling methodology we describe has great potential to provide new insights in a range of areas of interest to policymakers. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.GLOENVCHA.2013.03.010,article

Empirical analysis based on panel data of cities in China,"“Carbon Peaking and Carbon Neutrality” is one of the important tasks of China's current and future economic construction and development, but the carbon emission reduction effect of High-speed rail (HSR) has not yet been fully studied. In this paper, based on the panel data of 274 cities in China from 2003 to 2016, we take the opening of HSR in the cities as a “Quasi-natural Experiment”, and construct the Multi-period Difference-in-Difference Model to explore whether the opening of HSR can reduce carbon emissions of cities along the route, and use the mediating effect model and moderating effect model to further analyze its internal mechanisms. We find that:①The opening of HSR can significantly reduce the carbon emissions of cities along the route, and the opening of HSR in a city will reduce the carbon emissions of the city by about 2.4% on average, and this carbon emission reduction effect usually manifests significantly in the first year after the opening of HSR, and increases year by year thereafter.②The mechanism test shows that the traffic substitution effect, the optimization of the industrial structure and the promotion of economic agglomeration have partial mediating effect on the influence between the opening of HSR and urban carbon emissions. In addition, the increase in the intensity of government environmental regulations can strengthen the effect of the opening of HSR on reducing urban carbon emissions.③The regional heterogeneity research shows that the opening of HSR has a more significant impact on the carbon emissions of cities in the eastern coastal region and western region of China. Moreover, in the western region, the reduction effect of the opening of HSR on carbon emissions is only reflected in the key cities rather than ordinary prefecture-level cities.

There are different kinds of cyanotoxins and microcystin is the most common. Microcystin mostly affects the liver. Epidemiological studies in China and Serbia have shown an association between cyanotoxins and occurrence of Primary Liver Cancer. Cyanobacteria have been reported in Lake Victoria, which is an important source of drinking water for the riparian communities, thus posing a danger to human health. However, the health risk from exposure to toxic cyanobacteria in the Nyanza Gulf water remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to assess the health risk of toxic cyanobacteria to the riparian communities in the Nyanza Gulf. In a longitudinal study adopting survey and experimental design, 127 samples were collected monthly from both households and six beaches over six months. Cyanobacterial levels were determined using an enzyme assay method (PP2A). Different methods of household water treatment were compared. Two-way ANOVA was done to determine statistical significance of microcystins levels. 84% of water samples contained microcystins. Concentration of microcystins was 3.44g/L which is over the WHO limit of 1g/L. There was no variation between beaches and water treatment (ANOVA: F=0.97, p=0.47). Filtration proved to be the most efficient method of water treatment. The health risk factor of cyanotoxins in drinking water is 3.86. There is a health risk posed by cyanotoxins to the residents of the Nyanza Gulf who use the lake water for drinking since is over the WHO limit.

However, the causal association between chronic HBV infection and extrahepatic cancers remains to be determined. Methods: We performed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate whether chronic HBV infection is causally associated with extrahepatic cancers. We identified four independent genetic variants strongly associated (P-value < 5 × 10−8) with the exposure, chronic HBV infection in 1371 cases and 2938 controls of East Asian ancestry in Korea, which were used as instrumental variables. Genome-wide association summary level data for outcome variables, that included cancer of the biliary tract, cervix, colorectum, endometrium, esophagus, gastric, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung, ovary and pancreas were obtained from Biobank Japan. Findings: Using the multivariable inverse variance weighted method, we found genetic liability to chronic HBV infection causally associated with extrahepatic cancers including cervical cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 1.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.29–1.91, P-value = 0.0001) and gastric cancer (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.05–1.19, P-value = 0.0001).

Routing algorithms should try to achieve energy-efficiency and load-balancing among the heterogeneous nodes to prolong network lifetime. One of the solutions is by using duty-cycling in cluster-based routing such as in Sleep-awake Energy Efficient Distributed (SEED) clustering algorithm to minimize redundant transmission to achieve energy efficiency. However, this scheme suffers from idle listening problem, which lead to energy wastage across the network. Moreover, SEED cannot cope with an environment with sensor nodes with heterogeneous traffic rate. To cope with energy and traffic heterogeneity issues among sensor nodes, a traffic and energy aware routing protocol (TEAR) is proposed. TEAR avoids selecting node with low energy and high traffic rate for cluster head role to achieve load balancing. However, TEAR does not avoid redundant transmission from the sensor nodes that are in close distances. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid method called energy and traffic aware sleep-awake (ETASA) mechanism to improve energy efficiency and enhanced load balancing in heterogeneous wireless sensor network scenario. Unlike prior methods, in ETASA, the paired nodes alternate into sleep and awake mode based on node's energy and traffic rate. Moreover, we revised the conventional TDMA scheduling in SEED by allocating one slot for group of pairs in a cluster. This is done to address idle listening problem to minimize energy consumption. The proposed method improves the cluster head selection technique that selects high energy, low traffic and nodes with high number of pairs to improve balanced energy consumption.

However, due to limited capacity to test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, there are no reliable estimates of the true burden of infection and death. We, therefore, conducted a SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey amongst health care workers (HCWs) in Blantyre city to estimate the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in urban Malawi. Methods: We recruited 500 otherwise asymptomatic HCWs from Blantyre City (Malawi) from 22nd May 2020 to 19th June 2020 and serum samples were collected from all participants. A commercial ELISA was used to measure SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in serum. Results: A total of 84 participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The HCWs with positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody results came from different parts of the city. The adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 12.3% [CI 8.2 - 16.5]. Using age-stratified infection fatality estimates reported from elsewhere, we found that at the observed adjusted seroprevalence, the number of predicted deaths was eight times the number of reported deaths. Conclusions: The high seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among HCWs and the discrepancy in the predicted versus reported deaths suggests that there was early exposure but slow progression of COVID-19 epidemic in urban Malawi. This highlights the urgent need for development of locally parameterised mathematical models to more accurately predict the trajectory of the epidemic in sub- Saharan Africa for better evidence-based policy decisions and public health response planning.",https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16188.2,article
"Li, Xuesong and Ding, Yunlong",2020.0,{Holistic governance for sustainable public services: Reshaping government–enterprise relationships in china's digital government context,"The notion of holistic governance was originally proposed to make up for the fragmentation of public service provision. However, such a notion also has a great potential to be transferred and understood in the digital government context in China, where there is an increasing need to reshape the landscape of government–enterprise relationships that can enable enterprises to involvement effectively in holistic governance, or the planning and design of public services. However, previous empirical studies on holistic governance have neglected the question of how to make this happen. The aim of this article is to fill these gaps, building on holistic governance theory, this article offers a theoretical framework for government–enterprise relationships under the holistic governance paradigm. The framework identifies a comprehensive set of relationships that explain how these relationships affect enterprises' participation in public service provision. The empirical analysis is based on case studies of four e-services cooperation programs in China. We report three main findings. First, economic incentive should be developed in combination with a holistic governance strategy in order to encourage policymakers to reshape government–enterprise relationships. Second, it seems that the implementation of holistic governance is more effective when complemented with a managerial strategy in relation to organizational transformation. Finally, trust-building between governments and enterprises plays a pivotal role in nurturing the holistic governance paradigm. These findings have important policy implications for efforts to promote enterprise participation and cross-sector solutions to fragmented public service provision.",https://doi.org/10.3390/IJERPH17051778,article

The empirical results show that ICT has a positive and statistically significant relationship with health, showing that the higher the levels of ICT, the higher the level ofhealth. There is also a bi - directional causality between ICT and health. This indicates that ICT spurs health which, in turn, boosts ICT usage even further. Moreover, health expenditure has significant positive effects, suggesting that the higher the scale of health expenditure, the higher the level of health. Unemployment rate has significant negative effects, meaning that the higher the level of unemployment, the lower the level of health. The level of education, measured by adult literacy rate, has significant positive effects, depicting that the higher the level of education, the higher the level of health. On the contrary, environmental pollution, measured by carbon dioxide emissions per capita, has significant negative effects, indicating that the higher the level of environmental pollution, the lower the level of health.Resumen alternativo:У cmammi дослужено взаемозв'яз&kappa;и та причинно-насл^&kappa;овий зв'язо&kappa; мж 1КТ та здоров'ям в Африщ за перюд 1995-2015 рр.

A reflective-measure model equating household earthquake readiness to preparedness has been adopted assuming the presence of a common factor. However, using instruments with unknown psychometric properties is prevalent, instruments with known psychometric properties are unaligned with the construct, and information on the source of items is missing. This study proposes an alternative theoretical framework based on a causal indicator model equating household earthquake readiness to hazard adjustments applied to earthquakes; investigates the presence of a common factor; and, suggests a new measure constructed following the literature guidelines and based on prior research on household earthquake readiness: Earthquake Adjustments Checklist (EAC). Factor Analysis was used to analyze the data from 921 residents in the Azores, a Portuguese archipelago vulnerable to seismic risk. The final version of the EAC contains 13 items derived from the literature that are congruent with Portuguese household earthquake recommendations and with the supporting construct. These items were formulated to be applicable elsewhere. A four-factor solution was obtained differing from the three postulated dimensions of hazard adjustments. The results showed weak correlations, low commonalities and internal consistency pointing to a common factor that is nonexistent or at least insufficient to explain the variability in the adoption of household earthquake adjustments. Moreover, a weak correlation was found between two factors.

This chapter focuses on a systematic literature review of the main studies dealing with factors that appear to improve end-user acceptance of services provided by Moroccan smart cities. A specific method known as PRISMA is being adopted to select and synthesize relevant studies in this field. The results obtained from the systematic review indicate that the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) is the most utilized theory in the literature.

In response to common dilemmas of public engagement, public servants working in this area in Canada show clear patterns in terms of their reactions to time pressure and inclusion/exclusion considerations, but appear divided on how to resolve dilemmas as they relate to representation and public resistance–the two dilemmas with more political dimensions. These findings suggest that public servants working in this realm exhibit an adaptability and political sensitivity to the particular public engagement issue area and scenario presented to them, rather than relying upon idealized models of public engagement.",https://doi.org/10.1080/01900692.2022.2085299,article

Such an assessment is now a critical perspective in understanding the manner in which city development affects local and regional environment. Research in urban metabolism is a relatively new and ever-evolving area that encompasses a multidisciplinary field and moves toward a combined natural and social science. This paper offers a verifiable and reproducible systematic literature review of sustainable urban metabolism, analyzing and scrutinizing 813 papers for co-occurrence of keywords. This review aims to answer two research questions: (i) what are the prevailing themes in urban metabolism and (ii) how have these themes measured the support of cities toward sustainability? Through clustering analysis based on bibliometric method, four different focuses and their main keywords were outlined. The four clusters are general concept, methodology, policy issue, and specific element clusters, and their core keywords are city, energy, relationship, network, sustainability, China, indicator, economy, country, recycling, disposal, and recovery. Urban metabolism themes have evolved from nutrient flows and individual element treatment concerning industrial ecology in the course of the past century to ecological views of complex urban networks. The taxonomy of themes and the analysis of their evolution lead to further research agenda on the general framework of urban metabolism toward sustainability.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.05.056,article

Insights from the case of Milan,"This paper contributes to the literature on social sustainability in urban governance, with a focus on how this concept may be integrated into a Smart City strategy, so that excessive enthusiasm for smart technologies does not lead to neglect of the social implications of certain policies or programmes. By relying on a case study-based analysis, this work explores the path followed by the municipal government of Milan, and shows that integration of social sustainability into the Smart City strategy can be pursued by focusing both on the ‘content' and the ‘process' of strategy building. Rather than playing a strong leadership role, the planning department on the internal front and the entire municipality on the external front have chosen a role based on co-creation with citizens and other relevant stakeholders. The benefits of this approach may include the bottom-up character of several projects, better responsiveness and greater opportunities for different categories of actors; the drawbacks may include greater difficulty in ensuring that certain objective are reached (e.g. in terms of fairness and representativeness) and a higher risk of the dispersion of resources. This case also points to the difficulty of assessing the social sustainability of multiple rather than individual projects and programmes combined in a Smart City strategy: projects may reinforce each other in their social impact, or otherwise hinder possible benefits; also, a municipality may choose a combination of smart projects and programmes that attach different weights to economic, environmental and social sustainability objectives.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0969776416661016,article

An evolutionary perspective,"Smart city approaches in city planning have gained significant momentum in the recent past. While proponents argue that smart cities will bring positive social change by the adoption of ICTs, enriched governance and human capital among the citizenry, opponents point out about the negative effects and gaps exist in their planning and execution. Despite efforts to promote its practice, there has been wide criticism about the concept and the way it has been adopted and implemented. The roles of various players, especially the central role of the private sector, is often challenged in the academic literature. A variety of expectations from various stakeholders make the potential implementation strategies even more complex. The current paper reviews the research in the field to date to find that there are conflicting views in smart city planning, which limit our knowledge about the ‘real' smart city and its implications for building creative and inclusive urban space. Such uncertainty at the conceptual level, and the heightened importance given by policy makers and markets to its adoption, highlights the need for proper scrutiny. The paper clusters the various views pertaining to the building of smart cities and, thereby, proposes a 3RC framework, consisting of Restrictive, Reflective, Rationalistic and Critical schools, which critically analyses various stages in the development of the field. The overall aim of the paper is to understand how smart cities differ in their meanings, intentions and ‘offerings'.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.CITIES.2017.04.010,article

The current study explored whether and how the pedagogical design of an academic course, which developed a variety of digital literacy competencies, supported students in regulating collaborative technology-enhanced learning and helped them cope with the sense of psychological ownership over collaborative learning outcomes. In addition, we examined how these issues were expressed in cognitive, emotional and social aspects of students' perceived learning (Caspi & Blau, 2011). During four semesters, we conducted a qualitative analysis on reflective learning diaries, written by 78 graduate students studying education (N = 1870 codes). The bottom-up analysis focused on learning processes that enabled the development of various digital literacies conceptualized by the Digital Literacy Framework (DLF; Eshet-Alkalai, 2012): photo-visual, information, reproduction, branching, social-emotional, and real-time thinking skills. Furthermore, findings highlighted the importance of self-regulation and learning new technologies as an integral part of digital literacies. In addition, social-emotional statements expressed the development of effective communication and collaboration that enable students to cope with a sense of ownership over learning outcomes, and present different levels of teamwork: sharing, cooperation, and collaboration. Qualitative coding provided a more granulated perspective on perceived learning by differentiating between positive and negative aspects of emotional and social retrospection during the learning process. The findings contribute to educational theory by extending DLF and by providing new insights to the literature on students' perceived learning.

"Bataineh, Lana and Abu-Shanab, Emad",2016.0,{How perceptions of E-participation levels influence the intention to use E-government websites,"Purpose: This study aims to predict the intention to participate (ITP) in public activities by utilizing five levels of e-participation reported in the literature. The study used the levels of e-informing, e-consulting, e-involving, e-collaborating and e-empowering as predictors of the intention to participate in e-government services. Design/methodology/approach: An empirical test was adopted using a survey to measure the five levels of e-participation and the dependent variable, ITP in e-government initiatives. The survey included items from previous studies translated to Arabic. Subjects responded to a five-point Likert scale to measure their perceptions regarding the sub-dimensions of each e-participation level. Statistical analyses of the collected data were conducted to test the assumed hypotheses. Multiple regression of the five predictor levels was conducted to predict the ITP in e-government services. Findings: All the estimated means of e-participation levels were moderately perceived. The regression results indicated a significant prediction of three levels: e-informing, e-consulting and e-empowering. The other two levels (e-involving and e-collaborating) failed to predict the ITP. The coefficient of determination R2 resulting from the regression test was significant at the 0.001 level, which explained 61.9 per cent of the variance in the dependent variable. Research limitations/implications: The instrument used is a newly developed one in Arabic language, which might have influenced the results. The distinction between e-involving and e-collaborating might not have been recognized by subjects, which might have increased the limitations of the study. The results of this study call for more research to validate the instrument and try to see if new statements of e-consulting and e-involving might be employed. The other side could be to reduce the levels to three levels only or merge the insignificant ones into one (four levels only). Practical implications: Governments need to assert the role of citizens in the decision-making process. Such assertion is done through the e-participation process. Social implications: Jordanians perceive the e-informing and e-consulting levels to be a foundation that can be easily attained, but jumping to the e-empowering level means that the society is keen on the partnership with the government. Originality/value: This study is the first to use the participation levels (five levels) as predictors of the ITP. Most studies have utilized theories such as technology acceptance model (TAM), theory of reseaoned action (TRA) and unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) and other technology adoption theories. Also, this research has established ground for an Arabic survey to measure such levels, regardless of their prediction or description purpose.",https://doi.org/10.1108/TG-12-2015-0058,article

Through their analysis we identify the evolving interplay of a priori drivers, ad hoc initiatives and post hoc strategies evident in the crafting of smart cities.

I claim that Cerf fails to recognize the existence of derived human rights. I argue further that we need to consider what other human rights are necessitated by the digital age. I suggest we need a Declaration of Digital Rights. As a step toward the development of such a declaration, I suggest a framework for thinking through how to ensure the human rights are satisfied in digital contexts. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1080/08900523.2014.863124,article
"Dashkevych, Oleg and Portnov, Boris A.",2023.0,"{Human-centric, sustainability-driven approach to ranking smart cities worldwide","As cities worldwide adopt various high-tech solutions to solve emerging urban problems, transition toward greater smartness becomes a global trend. The question, however, remains how the cities' progress towards greater smartness can be monitored and measured. Although different smart city (SC) classifications exist, these classifications are not always balanced, with some of them placing an emphasis on ICTs and infrastructure, while others prioritize social performance of cities and their physical environment. In this study, we suggest a relatively simple SC ranking system, based on two basic principles – direct relevance to human welfare and equal representation of key dimensions of sustainability. The proposed assessment system, composed of nine quantitative metrics, is applied to 100+ major cities worldwide, helping us to identify the best and the worst SC performers. As the study also reveals, there are clear regional differences in the interpretation components and underlying dimensions of SCs with an emphasis on “economy and technology” in North America, “the environment” in Europe, and “society” in Asia.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2023.102296,article
"Hemani, Shruti and Das, Amarendra Kumar",2016.0,{Humanising urban development in India: call for a more comprehensive approach to social sustainability in the urban policy and design context,"Social sustainability is gaining importance in the international urban development context; however, in India, the concept is unclear and under-represented. New approaches and tools at the level of urban policy, design and implementation are highly biased towards environmental sustainability focussing on “smart” technological innovations. This scant focus, coupled with massive and inequitable urban growth, is resulting in social crises that not only pose danger to the country's stability but also represent some of the fundamental challenges to its sustainable future. Based on a detailed review of the literature on social sustainability, this paper explores its meaning and sets out its core components. It calls for humanising Indian cities and argues that a more comprehensive approach to the constituent but neglected “social” dimension of sustainable development which goes beyond the technical aspects of solving infrastructure-focused social issues to creating built environments that nurture strong urban communities is necessary. Analytical findings are translated into the social sustainability framework, which suggests a combination of (micro-level variables of) bottom-up and (macro-level variables of) top-down approaches in its implementation, because nurturing social sustainability in cities needs both, planned context and emergent actions.",https://doi.org/10.1080/19463138.2015.1074580,article
{El Hendy,2022.0,{Hybrid Approach for Developing Strategic ICT Framework for Smart Cities—A Case Study of Dubai's Toll Gates (Salik),"Information and communication technologies (ICT), systems, and people are driving innovative approaches and actions to address issues such as urbanization, demographic change, and carbon footprints of cities. Current research on smart city technologies is typically focused on the areas of technology and applications. As a result, a holistic strategic framework is lacking, as partner organizations often fail to adopt and comply with the necessary interoperability standards, which can undermine the effective and rapid roll-out and transformation of smart city project strategies. This study aims to develop an ICT framework on the determinants of smart city adoption that is developed to help society and policymakers achieve the goals pursued under the smart city initiative, such as maximizing synergies between different ICT infrastructure activities and avoiding large-scale investments without increasing their potential or focusing on short-term solutions without considering long-term needs. Based on data from the literature review and expert interviews, combined with a case study of the United Arab Emirates, this paper identifies the relevant determinants, which are conceptually grouped into seven basic dimensions. For each of these dimensions, relevant sub-dimensions are specified. The framework was developed and validated through three methods: interviews with experts, a desktop study of 62 smart cities, and finally a case study of the Salik system in Dubai based on the concept of the framework. By identifying key adoption determinants, the framework provides a useful analytical perspective for policymakers and researchers involved in the strategic feasibility roll-out and transformation of smart cities.",https://doi.org/10.3390/SMARTCITIES5040079,article

On the one hand, improvements in infrastructure are expected to expand economic opportunities for previously underserved populations. On the other hand, ICT growth may exacerbate inequality due to differential access and skill premiums. We use panel data from 109 countries during the period 2001–2014 to examine the empirical connection between ICT and income inequality in a cross-national context. Our results suggest that the effect of ICT on income inequality depends both on the specific type of ICT and on the measure of income inequality. In addition, the magnitude of ICT's effect on income inequality is comparable to that of more traditional forms of economic infrastructure.

We provide an overview of the empirical literature on ICT and productivity and highlight the main results and methodological differences. The majority of studies indicates that the productivity effect of ICT is indeed positive and significant. However, methodological approaches of how to appropriately estimate the ICT effect matter. While aggregate and sectoral growth accounting exercises suggest stronger differences of the ICT effect between US and Europe, firm-level analyses suggest no significant country differences. Moreover, we shed light on the notion of ICT being a General Propose Technology (GPT) enabling further innovations. Most of the GPT evidence on ICT is found for the US, while evidence for European countries is harder to come by. However, more theoretical and empirical research is needed to better understand spillovers and externalities of ICT and how these technologies transform our economies. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.INFOECOPOL.2012.12.002,article

The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of ICT on socio-economic development in China by considering spatial effects. To understand the overall influence of ICT on socio-economic development, the study used principal component analysis (PCA) to establish composite ICT and socio-economic development indexes based on data collected from 31 provinces in the period 2009–2018. In applying the spatial panel data analysis, this article argues that a spatial Durbin model (SDM) with spatial fixed effects is the most suitable model for the purpose of making estimations. The results of the SDM suggest the socio-economic development of provinces contains strong spatial correlations. More specifically, although ICT plays an essential role in improving socio-economic development, the spatial spillover effects of ICT negatively affect the socio-economic development in adjacent areas, implying that a digital divide exists among China's provinces and that this digital gap can lead to unbalanced socio-economic development.

The purpose of this paper is to observe the connections between smart city features as conceptualized in the framework proposed by Giffinger et al. (2007) and new technologies as tools, and sustainability as the goal. Design/methodology/approach – The connections are identified through a content analysis performed using NVivo on official reports issued by organizations, known as industry players within smart city projects, listed in the Navigant Research Report 2013. Findings – The results frame ICT and sustainability as “across-the-board elements” because they connect with all of the services provided to communities in a smart city and play a key role in smart city planning. Specifically, sustainability and ICT can be seen as tools to enable the smartization process. Research limitations/implications – An all-in-one perspective emerges by embedding sustainability and ICT in smart interventions; further research could be conduct through direct interviews to city managers and industry players in order to understand their attitude towards the development of smart city projects. Practical implications – Potential approaches emerging from this research are useful to city managers or large corporations partnering with local agencies in order to increase the opportunities for the long-term success of smart projects.

Additionally, the study aims to determine the major influential factors with regard to SMU in student learning settings as a means of enhancing their performance. To achieve these objectives, drawing on the literature related to SMU in higher education settings, a research model has been developed. Background Social media platforms have led to a significant transformation with regard to the communication landscape in higher education in terms of offering enhanced learning and improved teaching experience. Nevertheless, little is known, particularly in developing countries such as Jordan, as to whether or not the use of such platforms by students in higher education increases the perceptions of their academic performance. Therefore, this study has developed a model to examine the perceptions of higher education students with regard to social media use and its effect on their performance. Methodology The Structural Equation Modelling approach is used to analyze data collected via an online survey in the form of a questionnaire to examine the use of such a model. The study sample is drawn from undergraduate and postgraduate students from three universities (one public and two private) in Jordan. Convenience sampling is used to collect data. Out of 730 sent questionnaire, 513 responses were received, of which 403 were deemed qualified to be part of the data analysis process. Contribution This study contributes to the literature on social media in higher education by enhancing our understanding of the perceptions of higher education students on the use of social media in their learning. The tested model can be used as a benchmark for other studies that target the impact of social media on student performance in higher education. Findings The results reveal that perceptions of (1) usefulness, collaborative learning, enhanced communication, enjoyment, and ease of use of social media have a positive effect on the use of such media in student learning; (2) resource sharing has an insignificant effect on social media use in student learning, and (3) social media use has a positive influence on students' perceptions of their academic performance. Recommendations for Practitioners Senior management and policy makers in higher education institutions will have to train faculty members on effective strategies and methods in order to effectively integrate social media into education. This would equip faculty members with the necessary digital skills needed to help them to be fully informed regarding the benefits of social media and its tools in learning and teaching activities and would also allow them to avoid any possible drawbacks.Furthermore, faculty members should reconsider their current techniques and strategies, and adopt new methods in their teaching that encourage students to use social media platforms as part of their learning. For example, they can regularly post discussions and assignments on social media platforms to inculcate the habit of using such platforms among students for educational purposes. Students, on the other hand, should be aware of the implications and potential advantageous aspects of SMU in their learning. This could be Recommendations for Researchers are encouraged to investigate additional factors that might influence the use of social media by students as well as faculty members. Specially, an emphasis should be given to identify any potential obstacles that might hinder the use of social media in higher education. Impact on Society Social media is not only useful for socializing, but also it can be an effective educational tool that enhance students' performance in higher education. Future Research Although the collected data support the research model, this study is subjected to various limitations that need to be tackled by further studies. This study is based on the principles of quantitative research design. Data for this study was collected via survey questionnaires. Accordingly, future studies may consider a qualitative research design in order to uncover additional factors that may impact the use of social media on the part of higher education students. This would allow researchers to generate in-depth insights and a holistic understanding of SMU by higher education students. A convenience sampling method was employed to select respondents for this study. The respondents who participated in this study were from three universities (one public and two private) in Jordan.

Cyanobacteria have been reported in Lake Victoria, which is an important source of drinking water for the riparian communities. This is as a result of eutrophication in Lake Victoria increasing the levels of cyanobacteria in the Nyanza Gulf. The purpose of this study was to identify and quantify microcystins in household and Lake Victoria water in Nyanza Gulf. In a longitudinal study adopting experimental design, six beaches were studied and 127 samples collected monthly from both households and beaches over six months. Cyanobacterial levels were determined using an enzyme assay method (PP2A) and microcystin strains identified using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Two-way ANOVA was done to determine statistical significance of microcystins. The results showed that all beaches were eutrophic resulting in flourishing of cyanobacteria. 84% of water samples contained microcystins. Concentration of microcystins was 3.44g/L. Microcystin RR (MC-RR) is the most abundant cyanotoxins followed by Microcystin YR (MC-YR) and Microcystin LR (MC-LR) is the least abundant in the Nyanza Gulf.

Malaria control remains heavily dependent on pyrethroid insecticides, primarily in long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). Resistance in the major malaria vectors has increased in concert with the expansion of LLIN distributions. Identifying genetic mechanisms underlying high-level resistance is crucial for the development and deployment of resistance-breaking tools. Using the Anopheles gambiae 1000 genomes (Ag1000g) data we identified a very recent selective sweep in mosquitoes from Uganda which localized to a cluster of cytochrome P450 genes. Further interrogation revealed a haplotype involving a trio of mutations, a nonsynonymous point mutation in Cyp6p4 (I236M), an upstream insertion of a partial Zanzibar-like transposable element (TE) and a duplication of the Cyp6aa1 gene. The mutations appear to have originated recently in An. gambiae from the Kenya-Uganda border, with stepwise replacement of the double-mutant (Zanzibar-like TE and Cyp6p4-236 M) with the triple-mutant haplotype (including Cyp6aa1 duplication), which has spread into the Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania. The triple-mutant haplotype is strongly associated with increased expression of genes able to metabolize pyrethroids and is strongly predictive of resistance to pyrethroids most notably deltamethrin. Importantly, there was increased mortality in mosquitoes carrying the triple-mutation when exposed to nets cotreated with the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO). Frequencies of the triple-mutant haplotype remain spatially variable within countries, suggesting an effective marker system to guide deployment decisions for limited supplies of PBO-pyrethroid cotreated LLINs across African countries.",https://doi.org/10.1111/MEC.16591,article

Recent research highlighted that COVID-19 heightened the existing structural inequities and further exacerbated the technology-related social divide, especially for racialized communities, including new immigrants, refugees, and ethnic minorities. The intersection of challenges associated with racial identity (eg, racial discrimination and cultural differences), socioeconomic marginalization, and age- and gender-related barriers affects their access to health and social services, education, economic activity, and social life owing to digital inequity. Objective: Our aim is to understand the current state of knowledge on digital equity and the digital divide (which is often considered a complex social-political challenge) among racialized communities in urban cities of high-income countries and how they impact the social interactions, economic activities, and mental well-being of racialized city dwellers. Methods: We will conduct an integrative review adapting the Whittemore and Knafl methodology to summarize past empirical or theoretical literature describing digital equity issues pertaining to urban racialized communities. The context will be limited to studies on multicultural cities in high-income countries (eg, Calgary, Alberta) in the last 10 years. We will use a comprehensive search of 8 major databases across multiple disciplines and gray literature (eg, Google Scholar), using appropriate search terms related to digital “in/equity” and “divide.” A 2-stage screening will be conducted, including single citation tracking and a hand search of reference lists. Results will be synthesized using thematic analysis guidelines. Results: As of August 25, 2022, we have completed a systematic search of 8 major academic databases from multiple disciplines, gray literature, and citation or hand searching. After duplicate removal, we identified 8647 articles from all sources. Two independent reviewers are expected to complete the 2-step screening (title, abstract, and full-text screening) using Covidence followed by data extraction and analysis in 4 months (by December 2022). Data will be extracted regarding digital equity–related initiatives, programs, activities, research findings, issues, barriers, policies, recommendations, etc. Thematic analysis will reveal how barriers and facilitators of digital equity affect or benefit racialized population groups and what social, material, and systemic issues need to be addressed to establish digital equity for racialized communities in the context of a multicultural city. Conclusions: This project will inform public policy about digital inequity alongside conventional systemic inequities (eg, education and income levels); promote digital equity by exploring and examining the pattern, extent, and determinants and barriers of digital inequity across sociodemographic variables and groups; and analyze its interconnectedness with spatial dimensions and variations of the urban sphere (geographic differences).

However, as projects move from planning to implementation, the exploratory innovation methods are replaced by exploitative approaches. ‘The holistic vision and in particular, citizens' described needs, fail to transfer into the implementation phase. This paper identifies four main challenges as to why this happens and link these to theory on ambidextrous organizations that need to exploit existing knowledge while reaching into the future with its rapidly changing goals and technological opportunities. Implementing stakeholders are familiar with exploitative tools, which build on earlier experience and capabilities of the selected implementing stakeholders, and the implementation stage leaves little time and resources for innovation on a lower hierarchical level. While extensive research on smart and integrated planning focus on ‘breaking down the silos' meaning sectors and disciplines, our findings argue that the need to manage ambidextrous organizations and support both exploratory and exploitative innovation is equally important. An ambidextrous organization is one that has the ability to be efficient in its management of today's business while being adaptable for coping with the changing demand of tomorrow. We propose a model in which the organizational style and management style of innovative neighborhood pilots focus more on how to transfer knowledge and learn from the bottom-up and horizontally through management that foster both innovation models.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.TECHFORE.2018.11.007,article

This seems to result from ontological uncertainty surrounding the Smart City and who it serves. Such uncertainty has led to the techno-centric versus human-centric debate currently dominating the Smart City discussion. This paper adopts a systems approach to stratify society into three strata: the individual (micro), organizational (meso), and system (macro). I implement a systematic review of the Smart City literature to examine how Smart Cities are conceptualized. From an analysis of 41 papers, this research identifies a dualistic phenomenon occurring at all points in the stratified city system: sources of innovation (SOI) and Loci of change (LOC). Here, SOI refers to the perceptions of deficiencies which initiate the learning curve of innovation, while LOC refers to the structures which allow the learning curve to disseminate through the system. This analysis highlights an overemphasis on the organizational stratum and insufficient attention to the individual and system strata. To address this shortfall, I introduce the Social Innovation Cycle. This multi-level social innovation framework incorporates the interdependencies of SOI and LOC to link all strata, mitigate power asymmetries, and reduce marginalization. In so doing, I delineate where policy implementation can be directed for holistically developing the Smart City. I recommend that Smart City policy should target the intersection of SOI and LOC in pursuit of human-centricity.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.CITIES.2021.103459,article

This article investigates the impact of AI on carbon emissions, distinguishing between applied and innovative AI types. Analyzing data from 267 Chinese cities between 2008 and 2019, the study reveals that applied AI reduces carbon dioxide emissions by an average of 40,100 tons per unit increase. In contrast, innovative AI initially leads to emissions increases before ultimately decreasing, illustrating an inverted U-shaped relationship. Regional variations in AI's impact on emissions are influenced by each region's developmental focus and stage of AI deployment. Specifically, differences arise due to the continuous carbon reduction (-0.024) associated with applied AI and the initial emission increase (0.129) attributed to innovative AI. The study underscores the significance of tailored regional strategies in AI development for fostering sustainable smart cities. These findings contribute to the ongoing discourse on AI's environmental impact, offering insights to inform targeted approaches in green, sustainable urban planning.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.SCS.2024.105682,article

This has important implications for the development and implementation of future smart cities. The last two decades of smart city research has presented smart cities as a generic, universal aspiration without taking into consideration such local cultural differences. Future smart cities have several tasks ahead of them. The first is selecting culturally appropriate technologies from the vast array of global technologies now on offer. The second task is adapting such technology and the third task is in managing the acceptance of such technology. The above process is not linear but must be iterative, with technology acceptance considered simultaneously alongside the selection and adoption of such technologies. This study integrates the substantial literature on Technology Acceptance Modelling into the smart city discourse to begin to address this need. It also further develops our understanding of technology acceptance using the Structural Equation Modelling Method. A new synthetic model is proposed consisting of twelve factors, which have been selected based on a targeted literature review. A survey-based method was used to develop and cross-validate the model sampling a diverse population from various Iranian cities. The result of the above process is a new model named the Urban Services Technology Acceptance Model (USTAM). The validated model includes key factors related to technology such as Self-Efficacy, Operation, Work Facilitation, Relative Advantage and Compatibility. The USTAM is a useful tool for the prediction of technology acceptance in the implementation of smart cities. The final model is significant for various reasons. Firstly, it is significant for ensuring that selected technology is appropriate to local cultural contexts. Secondly it is significant to ensure that integration of technologies at metropolitan scales is managed effectively. The final significant reason is that it is well-suited to helping developing economies participate in the smart city boom in a resource efficient manner. The proposed model can potentially help cities achieve this by guiding them in the selection of appropriate technologies. The proposed model is developed with specific reference to Iran and Bangladesh. The authors suggest that the model is useful for cities of different cultural identities and characteristics, who wish to initiate their own distinctive smart city strategies.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2018.09.012,article

"Shahrokni, Hossein and {\AA",2015.0,{Implementing smart urban metabolism in the Stockholm Royal Seaport: Smart city SRS,"For half a century, system scientists have relied on urban metabolism (UM) as a pragmatic framework to support the needed transition toward sustainable urban development. It has been suggested that information and communication technology (ICT) and, more specifically, smart cities can be leveraged in this transition. Given the recent advances in smart cities, smart urban metabolism (SUM) is considered a technology-enabled evolution of the UM framework, overcoming some of its current limitations. Most significantly, the SUM framework works at high temporal (up to real-time) and spatial (down to household/individual) resolutions. This article presents the first implementation of SUM in the Smart City Stockholm Royal Seaport R&D project; it further analyzes barriers and discusses the potential long-term implications of the findings. Four key performance indicators (KPIs) are generated in real time based on the integration of heterogeneous, real-time data sources. These are kilowatt-hours per square meter, carbon dioxide equivalents per capita, kilowatt-hours of primary energy per capita, and share of renewables percentage. These KPIs are fed back on three levels (household, building, and district) on four interfaces, developed for different audiences. The most challenging barrier identified was accessing and integrating siloed data from the different data owners (utilities, building owners, and so forth). It is hard to overcome unless a significant value is perceived. A number of long-term opportunities were described in the SUM context; among those, it is envisioned that SUM could enable a new understanding of the causalities that govern urbanism and allow citizens and city officials to receive feedback on the system consequences of their choices.",https://doi.org/10.1111/JIEC.12308,article

In line with their study goals, researchers provided reasons for using PLS-SEM (e.g., model complexity, limited sample size, and prediction). These reasons are frequently not fully convincing, requiring further clarification. Additionally, our review reveals that researchers' assessment and reporting of their measurement and structural models are insufficient. Certain tests and thresholds that they use are also inappropriate. Finally, researchers seldom apply more advanced PLS-SEM analytic techniques, although these can support the results' robustness and may create new insights. This paper addresses the issues by reviewing business marketing studies to clarify PLS-SEM's appropriate use.

This novel approach has been applied to process reviews of primary care practices in England. Findings from an analysis of more than 200,000 reviews show that the quality of interactions with staff and bureaucratic exigencies are the key drivers of user satisfaction.

Drawing on ethnographic research on an Amsterdam project which encourages citizens to collect and share air quality data, we problematise this vertical reading of smart city politics. The project mobilises both republican citizenship and cybernetic citizenship, each assuming different logics regarding the ways in which citizens negotiate urban life by means of data and sensing technologies. While republican citizenship emphasises citizens' sovereignty, cybernetic citizenship emphasises their immersion into informational environments.

Methods: Walking speed was assessed using passive infrared sensors fixed in series on the ceiling of the homes of elderly individuals participating in the Intelligent Systems for Assessing Aging Change (ISAAC) cohort study. Latent trajectory models were used to analyze weekly mean speed and walking speed variability (coefficient of variation [COV]). Results: ISAAC participants living alone included 54 participants with intact cognition, 31 participants with nonamnestic MCI (naMCI), and 8 participants with amnestic MCI at baseline, with a mean follow-up of 2.6 ± 1.0 years. Trajectory models identified 3 distinct trajectories (fast, moderate, and slow) of mean weekly walking speed. Participants with naMCI were more likely to be in the slow speed group than in the fast (p = 0.01) or moderate (p = 0.04) speed groups. For COV, 4 distinct trajectories were identified: group 1, the highest baseline and increasing COV followed by a sharply declining COV; groups 2 and 3, relatively stable COV; and group 4, the lowest baseline and decreasing COV. Participants with naMCI were more likely to be members of either highest or lowest baseline COV groups (groups 1 or 4), possibly representing the trajectory of walking speed variability for early- and late-stage MCI, respectively. Conclusion: Walking speed and its daily variability may be an early marker of the development of MCI. These and other real-time measures of function may offer novel ways of detecting transition phases leading to dementia. Copyright {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0B013E318259E1DE,article

Our study sought to evaluate the incidence and predictors of cART-induced hepatotoxicity (CIH) among long term users on cART in a rural District hospital. Methods This was a hospital-based cross-sectional study in the Bali District Hospital. Spectrophotometric method was use for the quantitative measurement of alanine-aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate-aminotransferase (AST) levels. Patients with elevations of both ALT and AST were considered CIH. The Chi ($\chi$2) square test, ANOVA and Kaplan Meier log-ranked/ survival analyses were used to analyse the data. Results Of the 350 participants enrolled [156 (44.6%) males and 194 (55.4%) females], aged 43.87 ± 0.79 years (range 20 – 84 years) included in this analysis, 26 (4.4%) experienced moderate CIH. We observed 57 (16.3%), 62 (17.7%) and 238 (68%) elevated levels ALT + AST, ALT and AST respectively. Two independent predictive factors of CIH were, the male sex and alcoholism during the study period. Conclusion The prevalence of CIH in HIV-infected patients in Bali was lower than that observed in previous studies. The duration of therapy had no influence on the frequency of CIH.

A sustainable development strategy can serve as a political control instrument and management tool. For the development and implementation of such a strategy at the local level, municipalities might use citizen participation approaches. There exist manifold ways of consulting civil society, representing different levels of decision-making power. The analysis of this article is divided into two parts. First, we report on a case study of the pilot project “Global Sustainable Municipalities” located in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany and assess the current status of the use of citizen participation formats for adopting a local sustainable development strategy. Second, we developed a model of citizen participation approaches during different phases of adopting a sustainable development strategy. The purpose of this model is to assess the potential decision-making power of citizens during the phases and to help municipalities to get an orientation on participation possibilities. The results show that most municipalities count on participation mainly in the implementation phase of the strategy, less during developing it.

Metropolitan municipalities in South Africa have joined the technology revolution that embraces smart services delivery through various ICTs and advances the idea of e-governance using the Stakeholder Inclusive Approach. To comprehend how the City of Johannesburg (CoJ) encourages inclusion in smart services, the researchers use an explorative qualitative design that works well with the inclusive stakeholder approach, which supports a collaborative process in ICT adoption. The study discovered through qualitative thematic analysis that inclusiveness is a comprehensive process that considers the demands of different stakeholders in the adoption and implementation of ICT. One issue that leads to ICT efficiencies in the CoJ is data fragmentation from numerous municipal agencies. Inclusionary participation has been widespread in virtual Integrated Development Planning (IDP) forums and other cutting-edge services provided by the CoJ. There have been some exceptional examples of free wifi supply. The study's conclusion reiterates the importance of comprehensive inclusion in ICT adoption and implementation as it links communities with the municipality and stresses the need for city officials to commit to upskilling programmes to improve the delivery of public goods and services delivery.

This paper investigates whether the energy-efficiency in vacuum-based package handling can be increased without the need for prior knowledge of optimal process parameters. The core method comprises the variation of the input pressure for the vacuum ejector, compliant to the robot trajectory and the resulting inertial forces at the gripper-object-interface. The control mechanism is trained by applying reinforcement learning with a deep Q-agent. In the proposed use case, the energy-efficiency can be increased by up to 70% within a few hours of learning. It is also demonstrated that the generalization capability with regard to multiple different robot trajectories is achievable.

An intervention is needed to bring stakeholders together to solve these waste challenges. The objectives of this study are to investigate the fundamental issues and opportunities and to develop a sustainable and smart country-wide waste management system using industry 4.0 technologies. The system should provide a multi-dimensional approach, determine the maturity level of the waste management system in a technical method, and pursue the goal of designing a new strategy to minimise waste management problems. A comprehensive systematic literature review, intensive focus group discussions, and direct observation in Indonesian cities were approaches used to develop waste management business processes and their system design. Waste business processes consist of mixed-collecting, sorting, transporting, varied-treatment, and chained-disposal. The design of the proposed waste management system presents circular economy processes that can separate municipal waste, identify waste characteristics, and determine sustainable waste treatment technologies through the use of Internet of Thing (IoT) as the integrator. This study contributes to the sustainable development goals (SDG's) such as Good health, and wellbeing (SDG 3); Clean water and sanitation (SDG 6); Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8); Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12) and Climate Action (SDG 13).

However, very little information is available on the impact of insecticide resistance on blood feeding process in mosquitoes. Here, using two recently detected DNA-based metabolic markers in the major malaria vector, An. funestus, we investigated how metabolic resistance genes could affect the blood meal intake. After allowing both the field F1 and lab F8 Anopheles funestus strains to feed on the human arm for 30 minutes, we assessed the association between key parameters of blood meal process including, probing time, feeding duration, blood feeding success, blood meal size, and markers of glutathione S-transferase (L119F-GSTe2) and cytochrome P450 (CYP6P9a_R)-mediated metabolic resistance. None of the parameters of blood meal process was associated with L119FGSTe2 genotypes. By contrast, for CYP6P9a_R, homozygous resistant mosquitoes were significantly more able to blood-feed than homozygous susceptible (OR = 3.3; CI 95%: 1.4-7.7; P = 0.01) mosquitoes. Moreover, the volume of blood meal ingested by CYP6P9a-SS mosquitoes was lower than that of CYP6P9a-RS (P<0.004) and of CYP6P9a-RR (P<0.006). This suggests that CYP6P9a gene is inked with the feeding success and blood meal size of An. funestus. However, no correlation was found in the expression of CYP6P9a and that of genes encoding for salivary proteins involved in blood meal process. This study suggests that P450-based metabolic resistance may influence the blood feeding process of Anopheles funestus mosquito and consequently its ability to transmit malaria parasites.",https://doi.org/10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0230984,article

The study draws from the Difusion of Innovation (DoI) Theory and the Technology Organisation Environment (TOE) framework, which help to understand the acceptance rate of using ICTs in the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality (herein referred to as the CoJ). A construc- tivist paradigm, based on an explorative qualitative design that adopts interviews was used to identify sixteen participants from four diferent departments in the CoJ. The rationale was to assess whether the CoJ efciently utilising ICTs to increase deci- sion making, improve communication with citizens, uphold accountability and enhance smart service delivery in the 4IR. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data. The study's fndings reveal that the CoJ has rolled out various ICTs to increase institutional efciency towards attaining smart service delivery through its Smart City ofce. However, several challenges that include socio-economic disparities, digital illiteracy, gender inequalities, social norms, rapid urbanisation, high unemployment, and social exclusion adversely afect the CoJ in fully rolling out ICTs in communities.

Even if only tacitly, the resultant debate increasingly oscillates around how the effective use of information and communication technology (ICT) might render cities and urban space better places. This article responds to this imperative by suggesting how to capture users' views and perceptions of smart city services and applications and in this way enrich the decision- and policy-making processes. It is argued that by developing appropriate scales these otherwise subjective views and perceptions may be objectivized and hence made of great use to managers and policymakers. Accordingly, in this research, a process of scale development is conducted in four phases of both inductive and deductive methods. Following initial rounds of focus groups and assessment by experts, an international survey was conducted with 295 participants from Europe, Asia, Latin America, the Arab Peninsula, and other regions. The data were analyzed using IBM SPSS 24 and AMOS 20 tools. The study proposes a 20-item scale in five distinct dimensions: Technology anxiety; Work–life interface; Engagement orientation; Support orientation; and Quality of life.

Increasing urbanisation and the cumulative growth of urban management issues are pressing local governments to provide valuable services. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are established as drivers of this new wave of change in the redefinition of the relationship between the city and its citizens. Smart Cities rely strongly on strategies and solutions enabled by ICTs involving directly local governments, citizens and communities. Open data alone, though a relevant component of these strategies, cannot provide enough incentives for the engagement of citizens necessary to establish a collaborative and open governance system; data need to be appropriately elaborated, communicated and used. The main objective of this paper is to investigate how open data together with simple and standardised elaborations and innovative visualisation techniques may be used to provide new and updated services to citizens and communities: free and readily available services based on the wealth of information ‘owned' by local governments. Adopting a design science research methodology we develop and test a collaborative ICT-based tool called UrbanSense. We use it to highlight how systemic connections between citizens and city-government may be devised. On this point, the focus is on the feedforwarding of open data integrated with basic elaborations and visualisations as a means for the local government to create new and open services for citizens and communities. The use of the services prompts citizens to feedback new information in real-time to the city government. These interactions may be used to foster an open innovation ecosystem.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.GIQ.2016.09.002,article
"Odendaal, Nancy",2003.0,{Information and communication technology and local governance: Understanding the difference between cities in developed and emerging economies,"The current literature on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and planning suggests that the use of Information Technology (IT) in local government can enhance the management and functioning of cities. Of particular interest is the phenomenon of e-government, where debates and information surrounding local government matters are conducted in cyberspace. Of relevance also, are the networking opportunities that the Internet can facilitate between city governments and the institutional learning that can emanate from that. The increasing use of web-based Geographic Information Systems (GIS) applications raises awareness of spatial issues that impact on defined municipal areas, whilst interactive mapping provides opportunities for addressing spatial concerns virtually. Most of the literature does, however, focus on the experience of developed countries where capacity and resources permit a sophisticated understanding of ICT. Yet, evidence suggests that these tools are also used in some developing countries, with India often cited as one of the leading countries in achieving ICT prominence, but little seems to be published about this experience in Southern Africa. There are a number of innovative initiatives underway in South African local governments but most of these interventions are in their infancy. In contrast, there are a number of examples in developed countries that may provide some guidance for developing cities. This paper examines the Smart City initiative in Brisbane in Australia, and compares it with moves currently underway in Durban, South Africa to incorporate ICT in local governance. The intention is to expose the differences in approach, understand the capacity and resource issues that may impact, and draw some conclusions with regards to future interventions in Durban. Overall, the paper provides an initial conceptual landscape that begins to determine the extent to which ICT in local government can provide opportunities for Durban by learning from the experience of Brisbane, Australia. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/S0198-9715(03)00016-4,article

Illustrative cases reveal that those aspects typically associated with entrepreneurship, such as innovation, risk acceptance, pro-activeness and growth, are supported by a number of other elements within the public sector context studied. These elements include external drivers related to performance, including operational excellence and cost efficiency. They also comprise internal facilitators such as a more flexible culture, an investment in people, a focus on branding, and the deliberate application and transfer of knowledge. The implications are twofold. First, that innovation and entrepreneurship in the public sector can go beyond government policy-making, with the SOE model representing an important policy decision and sector of the New Zealand Government. And second, that the impact of several SOEs on international markets suggests competition on the global stage will increasingly come from both public and private sector organisations. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.5172/IMPP.12.2.138,article

Accordingly, a variety of policy initiatives are aimed at promoting the establishment, growth and impact of innovative start-ups. Designing such policies is a challenging task, because most start-ups fail. In addition, only a small share of those start-ups will ultimately prove to be innovative, and very few of those will eventually become high impact firms. Hence, effective policies require a better understanding of the processes by which innovative start-ups are formed, developed and create impact, as well as of the heterogeneous nature inherent to innovative start-ups along with their development trajectory. This article reviews 39 policy initiatives from around the world and classifies their approaches to the phenomenon of innovative start-ups. By relying on insights from the papers mentioned in this special issue, we develop a process framework by elaborating on (i) the antecedents of the creation of innovative start-ups, (ii) their founding characteristics, (iii) their behavior, and finally (iv) the outputs and impacts generated by them. Our framework highlights how policy initiatives, managerial issues and research approaches are conceptually different, depending on the specific stage of firm development.

This paper evaluates the input–output efficiency of two core industries of China's digital economy during the period from 2003 to 2019 and investigates the regional differences and dynamic evolution. First, this paper adopts the true fixed effect stochastic frontier approach (TFE-SFA) model to measure the input–output efficiency of the ICT equipment manufacturing industry and the ICT service industry. Results show that the input–output efficiency of the ICT equipment manufacturing industry is generally higher than that of the ICT service industry, and the efficiency of both industries has remarkable potential to improve. We also explore the regional differences in the input–output efficiency of the digital economy industry. It shows that the differences in the input–output efficiency for China's digital economy industry tend to expand in both the ICT equipment manufacturing industry and the ICT service industry. The differences in the ICT service industry are larger, and the efficiency difference in the digital economy industry comes from inter-regional differences. Finally, this paper analyzes the spatial–temporal dynamic evolution of the digital economy industry by using the methods of kernel density estimation, Moran spatial correlation analysis, and Markov chain state analysis. The state of the input–output efficiency of different provinces' digital economy industries is relatively stable, and no obvious spatial correlation exists.",https://doi.org/10.1007/S13132-023-01520-5,article

This paper distinguishes between well-structured problems and ill-structured problems. Well-structured problems are constrained problems with convergent solutions that engage the application of a limited number of rules and principles within well-defined parameters. Ill-structured problems possess multiple solutions, solution paths, fewer parameters which are less manipulable, and contain uncertainty about which concepts, rules, and principles are necessary for the solution or how they are organized and which solution is best. For both types of problems, this paper presents models for how learners solve them and models for designing instruction to support problem-solving skill development. The model for solving well-structured problems is based on information processing theories of learning, while the model for solving ill-structured problems relies on an emerging theory of ill-structured problem solving and on constructivist and situated cognition approaches to learning.",https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02299613,article

This study integrated social capital theory, social cognitive theory, and the technology acceptance model (TAM) to develop a comprehensive behavioral model for analyzing the relationships among social capital factors (social capital theory), technological factors (TAM), and system self-efficacy (social cognitive theory) in telehealth. The proposed framework was validated with 365 respondents from Nantou County, located in Central Taiwan. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to assess the causal relationships that were hypothesized in the proposed model. The finding indicates that elderly residents generally reported positive perceptions toward the telehealth system. Generally, the findings show that social capital factors (social trust, institutional trust, and social participation) significantly positively affect the technological factors (perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness respectively), which influenced usage intention. This study also confirmed that system self-efficacy was the salient antecedent of perceived ease of use. In addition, regarding the samples, the proposed model fitted considerably well. The proposed integrative psychosocial-technological model may serve as a theoretical basis for future research and can also offer empirical foresight to practitioners and researchers in the health departments of governments, hospitals, and rural communities. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.3390/IJERPH110504905,article

This work analyzes the adoption of e-government services and proposes that trust and personal values contribute to better understand such adoption. Specifically, this study proposes an integration of trust into the TAM, due to the online context characteristics (i.e., uncertainty). In addition, since these services are provided to the whole citizenry, two personal values very much related to e-government advantages (citizens' time consciousness and environmental concern) are proposed as moderators of the aforementioned relationships. Results reveal the mediating role of trust into the TAM framework which is confirmed by a rival models analysis. Besides, citizens' personal values moderate the influence of some antecedents of the intention to use e-government services, which suggests some interesting implications for public administration strategic marketing. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.CEDE.2012.04.004,article

This era is characterized by the pragmatic use of digital technologies in all spheres of economic, social, and cultural activity. In this context, an important aspect of the functioning of modern society is intellectual property law, which in the digital age acquires new challenges and opportunities. Intellectual property law recognizes and protects the intellectual and creative achievements of an individual or collective, giving them the right to own and control these achievements. Importantly, intellectual property law helps stimulate creativity and innovation, as it provides appropriate economic incentives to intellectual property owners. The growing use of digital technologies and the Internet raises several new questions and challenges related to intellectual property rights. On the one hand, the digital age creates unique opportunities for the creation, distribution, and use of intellectual property, leading to new forms of creativity and supporting cultural exchange. On the other hand, it creates problems regarding the control, protection, and reproduction of this property in the digital environment, particularly the growth of piracy and copyright infringement. In the digital age, intellectual property rights become the basis for innovation, technological development, and cultural exchange.

Using this periodisation, the paper shows how the content of urban sustainability discourse has changed. First, it illustrates that the dominant assumption of sustainable cities' discourse was to utilise economic growth to ecologically modernise urban environments. Second, it examines how the global economic crisis has intensified this fix and led to a new, even narrower emphasis on the techno-economic value of those aspects of urban environment that have economic and market potential. Third, it analyses the fragmenting of sustainable cities' discourse into a set of competing logics that reflect this narrower agenda.

In this context, this paper aims to provide better understanding of the geospatial dimensions of the urbanization and landscape changes in two megacities of Southeast Asia. Specifically, we examine and compare the intensities and spatial patterns of ULCs in Metro Manila, Philippines and Bangkok Metropolitan Region (Bangkok MR), Thailand, during the 1990-2000 and 2000-2010 periods, using remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) tools and techniques. In the measurement of ULC intensity, an intensity scale is proposed to determine whether the rate of ULC during a particular time interval, i.e., 1990-2000 or 2000-2010, relative to the uniform intensity that is based on the whole time extent, i.e., 1990-2010, is very slow, slow, medium slow/fast, fast and very fast. To characterize the spatial patterns of ULCs, the concepts of the diffusion-coalescence urban growth theory were applied. The results revealed that for Metro Manila, its ULC was more intense during the 1990s (fast) than in the 2000s (slow). For Bangkok MR, it was more intense during the 2000s (medium fast) than during the 1990s (medium slow). The results also revealed that Metro Manila has been in the process of coalescence, while Bangkok MR is still largely in the process of diffusion and expansion.

Results from network analysis established that information was the most commonly shared resource by organizations, followed by financial, material and human resources. Government agencies had the highest actor centralities; however, qualitative data suggest that these roles were the result of obligatory consultations by international organizations and lacked legitimacy in practice.

The planning of an integrated planning energy project is complex and involves diverse stakeholders with knowledge bases on different systems impacting energy planning. When to access the knowledge basis of these diverse stakeholders and how to sustain it overtime is not always clear. We propose intermediaries as both a process but also in the shape of actors to mediate knowledge transfer across different stakeholders to facilitate informed decision-making. We examine this within cases of three sustainable projects across Europe in different stages – early planning, later planning and implementation. Our findings indicate that intermediary processes and actors are key for knowledge transfer in integrated energy planning. In the early stage of integrated planning, practices need to become more aware of the role of intermediaries in resolving issues. Data and results from tools initiates a discursive intermediary process for knowledge transfer across different stakeholders. Intermediary is ongoing in the implementation stage but is more actor oriented and reactive to problems than in the planning stages.

"Sein, Maung K. and Furuholt, Bj{\o",2012.0,{Intermediaries: Bridges across the digital divide,"The challenge of bringing developing countries into the ""information society"" has been traditionally framed as bridging the digital divide. Meeting this challenge has predominantly been through technical solutions aimed at providing physical access to the Internet. Yet, other aspects of the divide such as low literacy rates, gender and religious issues arguably pose bigger hurdles in getting the benefits of the Internet to the vast majority of the population of developing countries. They are seldom aware of the information available on the net and even when they are, they have difficulty using it. To facilitate access and use of the Internet by the population, an intermediary is often needed. While case studies in the literature have shown several examples of such intermediaries, the role of this entity has not been conceptually examined. In this paper, we attempt to meet this knowledge gap by conceptualizing the characteristics, types and roles of the Intermediary entity. We present a view from practice through three vignettes of intermediaries from our own studies to illustrate our conceptualizations. Based on this, we discuss some implications for practice and offer directions for research. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1080/02681102.2012.667754,article
"van Winden, Willem and Carvalho, Lu{\'{i",2019.0,{Intermediation in public procurement of innovation: How Amsterdam's startup-in-residence programme connects startups to urban challenges,"This paper analyses Amsterdam's Startup-in-Residence (SiR) programme as new type of policy to engage startups in the development of urban innovation through a challenge-based public procurement of innovation (PPI) process. The programme is being mimicked by other cities and government agencies, but so far there has not been a rigorous, theoretically-informed analysis of the approach. In this paper, we specify and focus on the role of city-based, public-affiliated intermediaries as initiators, moderators and influencers of conversations between startups and the local government. The main contribution of SiR as a PPI intermediation programme has been to launch new types of fruitful conversations on several levels, that lead to institutional innovations rather than direct solutions for urban problems or startup development. In this sense, SiR fulfils a role inquiring and ascribing urban challenges with values and notions of “worth” that preceded and shaped innovation directions. We also suggest that engaging startups is effective for only a limited bandwidth urban challenges; different types of intermediation are required to foster collaborative innovation in more complex settings.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.RESPOL.2019.04.013,article
"Cariolle, Jo{\""{e",2021.0,{International connectivity and the digital divide in Sub-Saharan Africa,"In recent decades, international connectivity has improved significantly with the worldwide deployment of some 400 fiber submarine cables (SMCs), transmitting more than 99% of international telecommunications. If sub-Saharan African (SSA) has long remained excluded from this interconnection process, the maritime infrastructure network has recently densified and spurred an African connectivity catch-up. This paper estimates the impact of SMC deployment on the digital divide in a sample of 45 SSA countries covering the period of 1990–2014. Difference in differences (DID) estimations are conducted and highlight the particular contribution of SEACOM and EASSy cables, laid in 2009–2010, to Internet penetration in Eastern and Southern Africa. According to DID estimates, the rollout of these SMCs has yielded a 3–5 percentage point increase in Internet penetration rates in this region compared to the rest of SSA.

In the following study, Al-Duqm as Oman's primary economic zone is investigated, where outdated waste management practices are at odds with the national Sustainable Development Goals. In order to address this problem, we present a system that includes the use of Internet of Things sensors, combined with GPS tracking features and artificial intelligence capabilities. With this waste collection system, we aim to achieve enhanced speed and cost effectiveness and environmental sustainability. Ultrasonic sensors with AI-based route planning installed in waste bins enable the system to minimize unnecessary waste collection rounds by trucks. Laboratory evaluations of our system demonstrated a 28% reduction in fuel consumption and a 15% decrease in operational expenses, achieving collection performance levels that improved by more than 41.5%. The unique quality of this approach consists of aligning multifaceted technologies to fulfill Al-Duqm's special requirements for its dry climate and expanding infrastructure. The combination of sensor-generated data enables trucks to navigate empty container spaces, thus saving time and lowering emission levels. The findings of this study aid Oman in reaching its 2040 targets, in addition to Global Sustainable Development Goal 11, while simultaneously enhancing environmentally friendly initiatives in urban areas.

Because of the way research has framed this relation of power, the dominant response has been to seek social justice by either contesting these top-down exercises of (digital) power or by reconceptualising the smart city ‘from below'. In this paper, we join a growing chorus of voices recognising the importance of interstitial actors that influence the ways in which the smart city manifests. We draw on a five-year ongoing study in Calgary, Alberta, to examine two actor groups that are, properly, neither top-down nor bottom-up, but play an important role in envisioning, implementing and contesting how ‘smartness' is framed. The first set of actors, situated between the top and bottom of the smart city hierarchy, are most prominently community associations, non-profit organisations and ad-hoc task groups. The second group is comprised of groups with different digital practices, whose spectre of marginalisation influences how digital systems are articulated and pursued.

The resulting transaction sequences---balance-respecting trajectories---are data objects that represent observed monetary flows. Common sequential motifs correspond to known use-cases of mobile money: digital payments, digital transfers, and money storage. We find that each activity creates a distinct network structure within the system, and we uncover coordinated gaming of the mobile money provider's commission schedule. Moreover, we find that e-money passes through the system in anywhere from minutes to months. This pronounced heterogeneity, even within the same use-case, can inform the modeling of turnover in money supply.

The key role of standards is technically to ensure quality, safety, reliability of constructions as stated the relevant codes. With the construction industry growing very fast, the purpose of this study was to investigate on the application of Rwanda building standards, with regards to the existing code requirements and to identify the relevant gaps. The study was conducted based on initially set specific objectives, while the research methodology was mainly comprised of visits to different public and private agencies related to construction industry, observations on the sites and interview with different experts. The study established that Rwanda building standards were still accused of a low awareness and application as well as noticeable gaps. The level of awareness among all professionals was still at 71%. In general about application, only 55% of respondents confirmed the experience in application of Rwanda building standards, even if this level was higher for some categories. A good part of respondents composing around 57% thought that Rwanda building standards documents were still incomplete. Based on the above findings, adequate strategies for improving the awareness, application process and document completion were proposed; with the introduction of Rwanda building standards into academic curriculum, increase the number of awareness meetings and recognition of adequate research before design or review of any standard, among others.Keywords: Building code, Building Standards, awareness strategy, Law and Regulations, Monitoring process",https://doi.org/10.4314/rjeste.v2i1.3,article

For complex societal problems, including health and socioeconomic disparities, cross-sectoral collaborative research is crucial. It allows for meaningful interaction between various actors around a particular real-world problem through a process of mutual learning. This collaboration builds a sustainable, trust-based partnership among the stakeholders and allows for a thorough understanding of the problem through a solution-oriented lens. While the created knowledge benefits the community, the community is generally less involved in the research process. Often, community members are engaged to collect data or for consultancy and knowledge dissemination; however, they are not involved in the actual research process, for example, developing a research question and using research tools such as conducting focus groups, analysis and interpretation. To be involved on these levels, there is a need for building community capacity for research. However, due to a lack of funds, resources and interest in building capacity on the part of both researchers and the community, deeper and meaningful involvement of community members in research becomes less viable. In this article, we reflect on how we have designed our programme of research—from involving community members at different levels of the research process to building capacity with them. We describe the activities community members participated in based on their needs and capacity. Capacity-building strategies for each level of involvement with the community members are also outlined.",https://doi.org/10.1136/BMJGH-2021-007602,article

The manual management of the parking in such conditions is cumbersome. This research begins by reviewing IoT applications in parking management and closely examining the current IoT-enabled parking systems in Kigali. These systems are manually monitored by the parking spaces managers. However, there are very few parking spaces which have automatic entrance and exit gates without monitoring the parking occupancy status. This study stats by highlighting both strengths and limitations of existing systems in parking management and proposes an improved innovative solution that employs vehicle detection sensors, real-time parking guidance, availability monitoring, and data analytics to optimize parking space allocation. This system will reduce congestion and improve urban mobility through integration of innovative technologies, user-friendly mobile apps, and sustainable policies to enhance IoT applications in Kigali's car parking spaces.

Examining the views and beliefs of transport's technological entrepreneurs,"One of the main evolving trends in the transport system is the assimilation of Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) and other sophisticated hi-technology innovations into it. Those processes and practices are increasingly referred to as the ""Smart Mobility"" paradigm. In this paradigm, 'smart' and 'sustainable' are often considered synonymous, or at least complementary to each other. This research aims to examine the extent to which 'smart' and 'sustainable' are aligned with each other by conducting a survey amongst the main actors within smart mobility. These actors are referred to as transport innovators or entrepreneurs. The survey of n = 117 entrepreneurs shows that there is a mismatch between interpretation and understanding of what is 'smart' and what is 'sustainable'. It is clear that the concern of those transport entrepreneurs is primarily with commercial considerations and that their appreciation of what it takes to advance towards a more sustainable transport system is lacking. The belief amongst those entrepreneurs, it emerges, is that technological developments alone, specifically with respect to autonomous and connected vehicles, can lead to sustainable transport. This should be a real concern if those same actors are the ones who lead and pave the way forward for transport planning.",https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10020422,article

The role of the urban data trust in Sidewalk Toronto,"Over the two and a half years of its existence, Alphabet/Sidewalk Labs' smart city project in Toronto, Canada has been at the center of successive controversies relating to its proprietary approach to personal data. To address these concerns, Sidewalk Labs suggested putting the data collected in the smart city in a trust. As a “steward of urban data and the public interest,” the Urban Data Trust was expected to protect residents' privacy, establish responsible data sharing standards, and provide individuals with a share in the profits derived from the data gathered about them. This article proposes technoscientific/platform capitalism theories as a theoretical framework in the research on data governance.

Using a quantitative cross-sectional research design, data were collected from 242 stakeholders in Pakistan, including government officials, beneficiaries of e-governance initiatives, and IT professionals. Structured questionnaires were employed to measure e-governance implementation, poverty reduction, social welfare improvements, public service efficiency, and digital literacy. SPSS and AMOS were used to analyze the collected data. The data were analyzed using Descriptive statistics, correlation, regression, and mediation-moderation techniques. Findings reveal that e-governance significantly influences poverty reduction ($\beta$ = 0.38, p < 0.001) and social welfare improvements, mediated by public service efficiency ($\beta$ = 0.22, p < 0.001). Digital literacy and accessibility moderate this relationship, with higher digital skills enhancing e-governance outcomes ($\beta$ = 0.60, p < 0.001). The study underscores the importance of digital inclusion and efficient public service delivery in maximizing the socio-economic benefits of e-governance.

The Chinese government has been devoting to the promotion of smart cities for many years. However, it is unconfirmed whether the city is more resilient with all the modern technologies provided when unexpected predicaments like climate changes or disasters occur. Therefore, it is urgent to consider resilience in the smart city. This paper provides a MCDM approach to assess and rank the resilience of 187 smart cities in China. The results demonstrate that the overall resilience of smart cities is at a relatively low level. There is also a significant unbalance of resilience between smart cities due to different infrastructural, economic, social, institutional, and environmental conditions. The potential links between urban smartness and resilience were also explored, and the results showed significant positive relationship between the smartness of a city and its resilience. Evidence also proved that developing smartness is more or less useful for improving urban resilience.

The place and role of citizens in tomorrow's smart cities,"Imagining tomorrow's life implies, to a large degree, imagining the kind of cities we will inhabit in the future. In this framework, the smart city is actually a popular vision in discourses on urban development. This paper explores alternative ways in which citizens are positioned within different imaginaries of the smart city. The premise is that most mainstream discourses implicitly assume that smart city projects will empower and improve the lives of citizens. However, their role is often ambiguous. While some visions of the smart city are characterised by the absence of citizen's voices, others are populated by active citizens operating as urban sensors. Furthermore there are fearful visions of a future in which citizens will be subjugated by technologies that will hamper their freedom. This paper analyses the role of citizens in four alternative smart city imaginaries. The thesis proposed is that all four imaginaries are characterised by citizens playing a subaltern role, and hence the smart city is a relatively poor concept if intended as a model of the urban life of the future.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.FUTURES.2016.05.010,article

This study explores the acceptance of use of mobile phone data (MPD) in different areas, and how it is related to different types of trust. Based on a representative survey of citizens in the two smart cities, Oslo and Tallinn, four similar trust cultures are located. The acceptance of use of MPD differed significantly between the trust cultures and, as expected, was significantly stronger in groups with higher levels of trust, either generally or in terms of reliance on technologies. The acceptance of use of MPD for commercial product development was low for all groups. Findings suggest that future users of MPD need to be aware of the significant scepticism toward and rejection of the use of such data in large parts of the population. Unless visions of the smart city are grounded in the needs and wants of citizens, such plans are not likely to succeed, and negative understandings and images of a panoptic state may take stronger hold.

Design/methodology/approach Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and detailed analysis of multiple studies, this research organised the influential factors based on their effect: highest, direct and indirect. The study also integrated findings to present a consolidated view of e-government adoption drivers. Findings The research found that users' behaviour, attitude, optimism bias and subjective norms significantly shape their approach to e-government platforms. Trust in e-Government (TEG) emerged as a critical determinant, with security perceptions being of paramount importance. Additionally, non-technical factors, such as cultural, religious and social influences, play a substantial role in e-government adoption decisions. The study also highlighted the importance of performance expectancy, effect expectancy and other determinants influencing e-government adoption. Originality/value While numerous studies have explored e-government adoption, this research offers a novel classification based on the relative effects of each determinant.

While many studies have consistently identified that social capital and cultural factors are important for online knowledge sharing, their joint effect has to date received less attention. Addressing this gap helps us to move away from a one-size-fits-all approach of managing online communities to one which takes into account that social capital (i.e., trust, reciprocity, and a shared vision) may have differential effects on the sharing of high-quality knowledge. We therefore ask: To what extent does national culture shape the effect of social capital on perceived knowledge quality? We use survey data from two online communities from Germany and the Netherlands and demonstrate that the relationship between social capital and perceived knowledge quality differs in the two different national cultures, in particular for effects of reciprocity and shared vision. Besides practical contributions, we add to the literature by first integrating a social capital and online knowledge sharing lens and highlighting the moderating effect of national culture. Second, we provide a fine-grained understanding of the influence of national culture on knowledge sharing by delving deeper into differences between national cultures often regarded as similar.",https://doi.org/10.1080/0960085X.2020.1817802,article
"Argote, Linda and Ingram, Paul",2000.0,{Knowledge transfer: A basis for competitive advantage in firms,"This concluding article in the special issue of Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes on the foundations of knowledge transfer in organizations argues that the creation and transfer of knowledge are a basis for competitive advantage in firms. The article builds on a framework of knowledge reservoirs to show why knowledge transfer can be difficult and to identify the kinds of knowledge that are most difficult to transfer to different contexts. The article develops the proposition that interactions among people, tasks, and tools are least likely to fit the new context and hence are the most difficult to transfer. This theoretical result illuminates how organizations can derive competitive advantage by transferring knowledge internally while preventing its external transfer to competitors. Because people are more similar within than between organizations, interactions involving people transfer more readily within than between firms. By embedding knowledge in interactions involving people, organizations can both effect knowledge transfer internally and impede knowledge transfer externally. Thus, knowledge embedded in the interactions of people, tools, and tasks provides a basis for competitive advantage in firms. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1006/obhd.2000.2893,article

It is made available under a CC-BY 4.0 International license.  Background Brucellosis is a highly contagious zoonosis affecting human and almost all domestic species. It is a multi-burdens disease leading to severe economic losses due to disability in humans in addition to abortion, infertility and reduced milk production in animals. An Important element for effective prevention and control of brucellosis is to improve knowledge, attitude and practices of the community. Objective(s) This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) related to brucellosis at human-animal interface and to determine the risk factors for human infection in the Nile Delta, Egypt. Methods A matched case-control study was conducted at the main fever hospitals located in 6 governorates in the Nile Delta, Egypt between June 2014 and June 2016. Face-to-face interviews with cases and controls was done using a structured questionnaire. Differences in proportions of KAP variables among the cases and controls were evaluated by Pearson's Chi square test and a p value <0.05 was set as a level of significance. A multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis was built to determine the risk factors for Brucella spp. infection among study participants. Results A total of 217 cases and 434 controls matched for age, gender and sociodemographic characteristics were enrolled and interviewed. In total, 40.7% of the participants owned animals in their households and lived in shared accommodation with animals [48.8% of cases vs 36.9% of controls; (p= 0.003)]. The majority (78.1%) used to accommodate cows and buffaloes with sheep and goats. Human brucellosis cases experienced more animal abortions comparing to the controls [(23.5% vs 9.7%, respectively), (p= 0.0003)]. The majority of the participants (82.4%) did not notify authorities in case that abortion occurs in their owned animals. Apparently, 67.4% of the participants [(70.0% of the cases vs 66.1% of the controls) (p = 0.315)] had not ever heard about brucellosis. The overall mean practice score regarding animal husbandry, processing and consumption of milk and dairy products was significantly lower among cases comparing to controls (−12.7±18.1 vs 0.68±14.2 respectively; p<0.0001). Perceived barrier for notification of animal infection and/or abortion was significantly higher among cases (p= 0.034) and positively correlated with participants' education. Results of univariate analysis showed that participants who have animals' especially small ruminates were at a higher risk of getting Brucella spp. infection than others. In the proposed multivariate conditional logistic regression model, the predictors of having brucellosis infection were consumption of unpasteurized milk, having consumed dairy products in the last 3 months before the study, consumption of yoghurt or home-made cheeses and involvement in contact with animals [OR (95% CI) = 4.12 (1.62 - 10.75); 2.71 (1.06 – 6.93); 2.51 (1.21 – 5.24); 1.96 (1.17- 3.30), p<0.05; and 4.97 (2.84 - 8.72)], respectively. Participants who take more protective measures against infection were at a significant lower risk of being diseased with brucellosis; [OR (95% CI) = 0.23 (0.10 - 0.58); p<0.001], respectively. A model predicting risk factors for brucellosis among those who own animal showed that frequent abortions per animal increased the chance for brucellosis infection among human cases by 49.33 fold [(95% CI)= (8.79 – 276.91); p= 0.001] whereas the practice protective measures with animals was protective for humans as well [OR (95% CI)= 0.11 (0.03-0.45); p= 0.002]. Conclusion Consumption of dairy products stands side by side with the contact with infected animals particularly aborted ones as the major risk factors for Brucella spp. infection among humans in Egypt. On the other hand, there is a poor knowledge, negative attitudes and risky behaviors among villagers which increase the magnitude of the risk of brucellosis transmission at the human-animal interface. This supports the need for integrating health education in the national brucellosis control programs in Egypt with a special emphasis on hygienic animal husbandry, disease notification and benefits of animal vaccination. Author summary Zoonotic brucellosis has a vast global burden and remains neglected in many areas of the world despite notable advances in disease containment strategies. Despite the implementation of a national brucellosis control program in Egypt, the challenges for the disease eradication are intractable and multifaceted. We modeled in the present study the multivariate factors for brucellosis persistence in Egypt which apparently pointed to lack of basic understanding of the nature of brucellosis, traditional practices, beliefs and risky behaviors being undertaken on farms and at households across a wide region of the country. Predominantly, consumption of dairy products from unregulated sources; underreporting animal infection and abortion; underutilization of animal vaccination service; unsanitary disposal of abortus; use of milk of infected/aborted ruminants and lack of protective measure when practicing animal husbandry. Together, these conflict with disease intervention strategies and contribute to disease spread and re-emergence. The proposed model can provide a framework for future containment strategies that should be adopted to support and enhance the adherence to the current national brucellosis control program.",https://doi.org/10.1101/607655,article

"Olwig, Kenneth R.",1989.0,{LIFE BETWEEN BUILDINGS: USING PUBLIC SPACE,"A plethora of stimuli including hormones and neurotransmitters mediate a rise of the cellular level of cAMP and thereby activation of protein kinase A (PKA). PKA phosphorylates and thereby modulates the activity of a wide range of cellular targets. It is now appreciated that different stimuli induce the activation of PKA at specific sites where the kinase phosphorylates particular substrates in close proximity. The tethering of PKA to cellular compartments is facilitated by A kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs). The incorporation of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) into AKAP-based signalling complexes provides gradients of cAMP that regulate PKA activity locally. An example for a process depending on compartmentalised cAMP/PKA signalling is the arginine-vasopressin (AVP)-mediated water reabsorption in renal collecting duct principal cells. Upon activation through AVP, PKA phosphorylates the water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP-2) located on intracellular vesicles. The phosphorylation triggers the redistribution of AQP2 to the plasma membrane. AKAP-anchored PKA has been shown to be involved in AQP2 shuttling. Here, AKAP18 isoforms and members of the PDE4 family of PDEs are shown to be differentially localised in renal principal cells.",https://doi.org/10.3368/lj.8.1.54,article

Spatial and temporal dynamics of land use/cover changes were quantified using three Landsat images, a supervised classification algorithm and the post-classification change detection technique in GIS. Accuracy of the Landsat-derived land use/cover maps ranged from 85 to 90%. The analysis revealed that substantial growth of built-up areas in Greater Dhaka over the study period resulted significant decrease in the area of water bodies, cultivated land, vegetation and wetlands. Urban land expansion has been largely driven by elevation, population growth and economic development. Rapid urban expansion through infilling of low-lying areas and clearing of vegetation resulted in a wide range of environmental impacts, including habitat quality. As reliable and current data are lacking for Bangladesh, the land use maps produced in this study will contribute to both the development of sustainable urban land use planning decisions and also for forecasting possible future changes in growth patterns. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2008.12.005,article
"Antrop, Marc",2004.0,{Landscape change and the urbanization process in Europe,"Urbanization is one of the fundamental characteristics of the European civilization. It gradually spread from Southeast Europe around 700 B.C., across the whole continent. Cities and the urban networks they formed were always an important factor in the development and shaping of their surrounding regions. Polarization of territory between urban and rural and accessibility are still important aspects in landscape dynamics. Urbanization and its associated transportation infrastructure define the relationship between city and countryside. Urbanization, expressed as the proportion of people living in urban places shows a recent but explosive growth reaching values around 80% in most European countries. Simultaneously the countryside becomes abandoned. Thinking, valuing and planning the countryside is done mainly by urbanites and future rural development is mainly focused upon the urban needs. Thinking of urban places with their associated rural hinterland and spheres of influence has become complex. Clusters of urban places, their situation in a globalizing world and changing accessibility for fast transportation modes are some new factors that affect the change of traditional European cultural landscapes. Urbanization processes show cycles of evolution that spread in different ways through space. Urbanization phases developed at different speeds and time between Northern and Southern Europe. Main cities are affected first, but gradually urbanization processes affect smaller settlements and even remote rural villages. Functional urban regions (FURs) are a new concept, which is also significant for landscape ecologists. Local landscape change can only be comprehended when situated in its general geographical context and with all its related dynamics. Patterns of change are different for the countryside near major cities, for metropolitan villages and for remote rural villages. Planning and designing landscapes for the future requires that this is understood. Urbanized landscapes are highly dynamic, complex and multifunctional. Therefore, detailed inventories of landscape conditions and monitoring of change are urgently needed in order to obtain reliable data for good decision-making. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/S0169-2046(03)00026-4,article

Quantitative results from public sector innovation awards indicate that bottomup innovation occurs much more frequently than conventional wisdom would indicate. Effective political leadership in a crisis requires decision making that employs a wide search for information, broad consultation, and skeptical examination of a wide range of options. Successful leadership of a turnaround requires an agency head to regain political confidence, reach out to stakeholders and clients, and to convince dispirited staff that change is possible and that their efforts to do better will be supported. Political leaders and agency heads can create a supportive climate for bottomup innovation by consulting staff, instituting formal awards and informal recognition for innovators, promoting innovators, protecting innovators from controloriented central agencies, and publicly championing bottomup innovations that have proven successful and have popular appeal. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1108/01437730210449357,article

However, there are significant challenges in converting this large-scale sensing data into decisions for real-world applications. Motivated by applications like health monitoring and intervention and home automation we consider a novel problem called Activity Prediction, where the goal is to predict future activity occurrence times from sensor data. In this paper, we make three main contributions. First, we formulate and solve the activity prediction problem in the framework of imitation learning and reduce it to a simple regression learning problem. This approach allows us to leverage powerful regression learners that can reason about the relational structure of the problem with negligible computational overhead. Second, we present several metrics to evaluate activity predictors in the context of real-world applications. Third, we evaluate our approach using real sensor data collected from 24 smart home testbeds. We also embed the learned predictor into a mobile-device-based activity prompter and evaluate the app for nine participants living in smart homes. Our results indicate that our activity predictor performs better than the baseline methods, and offers a simple approach for predicting activities from sensor data.",https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2017.2750669,article

This article identifies the critical conditions for meaningful use of public participation GIS (PPGIS) tools to support the making of master plan in Helsinki. With PPGIS tools, residents' insight of their living environment can be reached and utilized along the planning process. The results are divided to conceptual and empirical points. Whereas the conceptual points emphasize better understanding of the locus of the PPGIS tools in planning process, the empirical findings reveal new ways to study how residents' perceptions align with the plan proposal. Though new tools, data and analysis can support representativeness, independence, early involvement, influence and transparency, planners and residents need more understanding of the benefits of these tools. The study indicates that though planners found the collected data and the analysis valuable, they still lacked the skills and institutional motivation to use the data effectively.

In the digital era, this struggle is manifested in the work of civil-society organizations calling to expand the boundaries of digital rights such as access to the internet, freedom of speech, and the right to privacy. Alongside their traditional activity of confronting governments and internet organizations, these bodies have also engaged in educating citizens about their rights. In order to shed light on such educational efforts, I examine the activities of four civil-society organizations operating in three countries (Germany, Israel, and the U.S.) by conducting a content analysis of their websites between 2013 and 2015. The results suggest that the organizations' interactions with the public are guided by three main principles: (1) cultural informational framing: delivering accurate technological and political information, which is framed so as to resonate with the cultural premises and everyday lives of the target audiences; (2) personal activism: propelling citizens toward participation, primarily through political clicktivism and by providing them with technological guidance and tools for digital self-protection; and (3) branding digital rights activism: fostering a unique image for a particular organization's digital rights activism, mostly through selling merchandise to citizens. Using these strategies, the organizations aim to construct the social–political–cultural identity of a generation who are knowledgeable, politically active, and aware of their rights in the digital age.

We first review the literature on trust and explore how radical information technologies may work to alter the production or maintenance of trust. We then develop hypotheses about how citizens' experience with e-government, satisfaction with e-government and government Web sites, and trust in government are interrelated. Moreover, the model for e-government and Web site satisfaction incorporates citizen perspectives on electronic transaction, transparency, and interactivity. Using data obtained from the Council on Excellence in Government, we then develop and test a two-stage multiple-equation model that simultaneously predicts experience, satisfaction, and trust. Findings indicate that government Web site use is positively associated with e-government satisfaction and Web site satisfaction and that e-government satisfaction is positively associated with trust in government. We also find that while citizens are generally satisfied with the electronic provision of information (transparency), there is some dissatisfaction with the transaction and interactivity of Web sites. We conclude that electronic government strategies - transaction, transparency, and interactivity - are important factors that directly affect e-government satisfaction and indirectly affect trust. Individuals who use government Web sites are not only critical consumers but also demanding citizens. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1093/JOPART/MUI021,article

To assess how objectively measured levels of physical activity are related with objectively measured aspects of the physical environment around each participant's home while controlling for sociodemographic covariates. Objective measures of the built environment unique to each household's physical location were developed within a geographic information system to assess land-use mix, residential density, and street connectivity. These measures were then combined into a walkability index. Accelerometers were deployed over a 2-day period to capture objective levels of physical activity in 357 adults. Measures of land-use mix, residential density, and intersection density were positively related with number of minutes of moderate physical activity per day. A combined walkability index of these urban form factors was significant (p=0.002) and explained additional variation in the number of minutes of moderate activity per day over sociodemographic covariates. Thirty-seven percent of individuals in the highest walkability index quartile met the ≥30 minutes of physical activity recommended, compared to only 18% of individuals in the lowest walkability quartile. Individuals in the highest walkability quartile were 2.4 times more likely (confidence interval=1.18-4.88) than individuals in the lowest walkability quartile to meet the recommended ≥30 minutes of moderate physical activity per day. This research supports the hypothesis that community design is significantly associated with moderate levels of physical activity. These results support the rationale for the development of policy that promotes increased levels of land-use mix, street connectivity, and residential density as interventions that can have lasting public health benefits. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.AMEPRE.2004.11.001,article

These responsibilities become even more critical as they transition into smart cities adopting advanced technological innovations to revolutionize governance, enhance service delivery, and foster sustainable and resilient urban environments. Technological advancements like Internet-of-Things devices and artificial intelligence-driven approaches can provide better services to residents, but they also expose local governments to cyberthreats. There has been, nonetheless, very little study on cybersecurity issues from the local government perspective, and information on the multifaceted nature of cybersecurity in local government settings is scattered and fragmented, highlighting the need for a conceptual understanding and adequate action. Against this backdrop, this study aims to identify key components of cybersecurity in a local governmental context through a systematic literature review. This review further extends to the development of a conceptual framework providing a comprehensive understanding of the local government's cybersecurity landscape. This study makes a significant contribution to the academic and professional domains of cybersecurity issues and policies within the local governmental context, offering valuable insights to local decision-makers, practitioners, and academics. This study also helps identify vulnerabilities, enabling stakeholders to recognize shortcomings in their cybersecurity and implement effective countermeasures to safeguard confidential information and documents. Thus, the findings inform local government policy to become more cybersecurity-aware and prepared.",https://doi.org/10.3390/APP14135501,article

We undertook a different benchmarking approach, focused on learning best practices among cities, in late 2008 and early 2009. A benchlearning methodology (BLM) was developed, and a pilot study with 15 European cities was carried out. In this paper, we present the actual impact of the benchmarking study with respect to improvements in services, as the effectiveness of e-government benchmarking has rarely been evaluated. We discuss and analyse the results of a survey carried out in the same 15 cities four years after the pilot study. This paper presents evidence that BLM helped cities to identify good practices that they could learn from, and that some e-services were subsequently improved. The survey reveals that some changes are needed in the benchmarking methodology. The main one is the updating of the BLM bottom-up e-services catalogue, which is deeply discussed within the changing context of Smart Cities, especially the enlargement of the ecosystem of e-services to include citizens, the third sector, entrepreneurs, companies and other actors. A second one is the measurement of the adoption of e-services by citizens, also rarely assessed.",https://doi.org/10.3233/IP-150366,article

The model has now been applied to two rapidly growing, but remarkably different urban areas: the San Francisco Bay region in California and the Washington/Baltimore corridor in the Eastern United States. This paper presents the calibration and prediction results for both regions, reviews their data requirements, compares the differences in the initial configurations and control parameters for the model in the two settings, and discusses the role of GIS in the applications. The model has generated some long term predictions that appear useful for urban planning and are consistent with results from other models and observations of growth. Although the GIS was only loosely coupled with the model, the model's provision of future urban patterns as data layers for GIS description and analysis is an important outcome of this type of calculation. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1080/136588198241617,article

In realizing the vision of the Internet of Things, LPWA technologies complement and sometimes supersede the conventional cellular and short range wireless technologies in performance for various emerging smart city and machine-to-machine applications. This review paper presents the design goals and the techniques, which different LPWA technologies exploit to offer wide-area coverage to low-power devices at the expense of low data rates. We survey several emerging LPWA technologies and the standardization activities carried out by different standards development organizations (e.g., IEEE, IETF, 3GPP, ETSI) as well as the industrial consortia built around individual LPWA technologies (e.g., LoRa Alliance, Weightless-SIG, and Dash7 alliance). We further note that LPWA technologies adopt similar approaches, thus sharing similar limitations and challenges. This paper expands on these research challenges and identifies potential directions to address them.

Because systematic evaluations of genetic prediction had not yet been conducted in ancestries that span African diversity, we calculated polygenic risk scores (PRS) in simulations across Africa and in empirical data from South Africa, Uganda, and the UK to better understand the generalizability of genetic studies. PRS accuracy improves with ancestry-matched discovery cohorts more than from ancestry-mismatched studies. Within ancestrally and ethnically diverse South Africans, we find that PRS accuracy is low for all traits but varies across groups. Differences in African ancestries contribute more to variability in PRS accuracy than other large cohort differences considered between individuals in the UK versus Uganda. We computed PRS in African ancestry populations using existing European-only versus ancestrally diverse genetic studies; the increased diversity produced the largest accuracy gains for hemoglobin concentration and white blood cell count, reflecting large-effect ancestry-enriched variants in genes known to influence sickle cell anemia and the allergic response, respectively. Differences in PRS accuracy across African ancestries originating from diverse regions are as large as across out-of-Africa continental ancestries, requiring commensurate nuance. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.12.426453,article

In this context, cities in Latin America have high potential to convert sunlight into energy. Hence, the main objective of this study was to determine the potential of electricity self-sufficiency production and mitigation of GHG emissions in three medium-sized cities in Peru through the revalorization of underutilized rooftop areas in urban environments. Each city represented a distinct natural area of Peru: Pacific coast, Andean region and Amazon basin. More specifically, photovoltaic solar systems were the technology selected for implementation in these rooftop areas. Data on incident solar energy, temperature and energy consumption were collected. Thereafter, ArcGis10.3 was used to quantify the total usable area in the cities. A series of correction factors, including tilt, orientation or roof profiles were applied to attain an accurate value of usable area. Finally, Life Cycle Assessment was the methodology chosen to calculate the reduction of environmental impacts as compared to the current context of using electricity from the regional grids. Results showed that the cities assessed have the potential to obtain their entire current electricity demand for residential, commercial and public lighting purposes, augmenting energy security and resilience to intermittent natural disasters, with the support of decentralized storage systems. This approach would also translate into substantial reductions in terms of GHG emissions. Annual reductions in GHG emissions ranged from 112 ton CO2eq in the city of Ayacucho to over 523 kton CO2eq in Pucallpa, showing that cities in the Amazon basin would be the ones that benefit the most in terms of climate change mitigation.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.12.003,article

However, recent developments of machine learning within Big Data environment have not been exploited enough in this domain. This paper aims to answer the question of how to incorporate Big Data platform and machine learning into an intelligent system for managing energy efficiency of public sector as a substantial part of the smart city concept. Deep neural networks, Rpart regression tree and Random forest with variable reduction procedures were used to create prediction models of specific energy consumption of Croatian public sector buildings. The most accurate model was produced by Random forest method, and a comparison of important predictors extracted by all three methods has been conducted. The models could be implemented in the suggested intelligent system named MERIDA which integrates Big Data collection and predictive models of energy consumption for each energy source in public buildings, and enables their synergy into a managing platform for improving energy efficiency of the public sector within Big Data environment. The paper also discusses technological requirements for developing such a platform that could be used by public administration to plan reconstruction measures of public buildings, to reduce energy consumption and cost, as well as to connect such smart public buildings as part of smart cities.

One of the challenges with PdM is generating the so-called ""health factors,"" or quantitative indicators, of the status of a system associated with a given maintenance issue, and determining their relationship to operating costs and failure risk. The proposed PdM methodology allows dynamical decision rules to be adopted for maintenance management, and can be used with high-dimensional and censored data problems. This is achieved by training multiple classification modules with different prediction horizons to provide different performance tradeoffs in terms of frequency of unexpected breaks and unexploited lifetime, and then employing this information in an operating cost-based maintenance decision system to minimize expected costs.

Thus, securing the data, machines (devices), and user's privacy in cyberspace has become an utmost concern for individuals, business organizations, and national governments. In recent years, machine learning (ML) has been widely employed in cybersecurity, for example, intrusion or malware detection and biometric-based user authentication. However, ML algorithms are vulnerable to attacks both in the training and testing phases, which usually leads to remarkable performance decreases and security breaches. Comparatively, limited studies have been conducted to understand the essence and degree of the vulnerabilities of ML techniques against security threats and their defensive mechanisms.

However, top-down approaches where the researchers and policy-makers ‘prescribe' solutions are more common than community-engaged approaches where community members and researchers work hand-in-hand in community-engaged research to identify the problems, codevelop solutions and recommend policy changes. In this article, we reflect on a comprehensive community-engaged research approach that we undertook to identify the barriers to equitable primary care access among a South Asian (Bangladeshi) immigrant community in Canada. This article summarised the experience of our programme of research and describes our understanding of community-engaged research among an immigrant/racialised community that meaningfully interacts with the community. In employing the principles of community-based participatory research, integrated knowledge translation and human centred design, we reflect on the comprehensive community-engaged research approach we undertook. We believe that our reflections can be useful to academics while conducting community-engaged research on relevant issues across other immigrant/racialised communities.",https://doi.org/10.1136/BMJGH-2021-006370,article
"Stasch, Christoph and Scheider, Simon and Pebesma, Edzer and Kuhn, Werner",2014.0,{Meaningful spatial prediction and aggregation,"The appropriateness of spatial prediction methods such as Kriging, or aggregation methods such as summing observation values over an area, is currently judged by domain experts using their knowledge and expertise. In order to provide support from information systems for automatically discouraging or proposing prediction or aggregation methods for a dataset, expert knowledge needs to be formalized. This involves, in particular, knowledge about phenomena represented by data and models, as well as about underlying procedures. In this paper, we introduce a novel notion of meaningfulness of prediction and aggregation. To this end, we present a formal theory about spatio-temporal variable types, observation procedures, as well as interpolation and aggregation procedures relevant in Spatial Statistics. Meaningfulness is defined as correspondence between functions and data sets, the former representing data generation procedures such as observation and prediction. Comparison is based on semantic reference systems, which are types of potential outputs of a procedure. The theory is implemented in higher-order logic (HOL), and theorems about meaningfulness are proved in the semi-automated prover Isabelle. The type system of our theory is available as a Web Ontology Language (OWL) pattern for use in the Semantic Web. In addition, we show how to implement a data-model recommender system in the statistics tool environment R. We consider our theory groundwork to automate semantic interoperability of data and models. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.ENVSOFT.2013.09.006,article

"Rebernik, Nata{\v{s",2020.0,{Measuring disability inclusion performance in cities using disability inclusion evaluation tool (DIETool),"Cities are exposed to a growing complexity, diversity and rapid socio-technical developments. One of the greatest challenges is as of how to become fully inclusive to fit the needs of all their citizens, including those with disabilities. Inclusive city, both in theory and practice, still lacks attention. Even in the context of ambitious contemporary concepts, such as smart and sustainable city, the question remains: Do smart and sustainable cities consider inclusiveness of all their inhabitants? Among numerous evaluation systems that measure city's smartness, sustainability or quality of life, those tackling inclusion are very rare. Specifically, disability inclusion is hardly covered. This may be one of the reasons why cities struggle with applying disability inclusion to practice in a holistic and integrative way. This paper proposes a Disability Inclusion Evaluation Tool (DIETool) and Disability Inclusion Performance Index (DIPI), designed to guide cities through a maze of accessibility and disability inclusion related requirements set within the political, legislative and standardization frameworks. The testing in two European cities shows that the tool is beneficial for providing diagnosis as to how disability friendly a city is, and as such offers an opportunity for designing informed corrective measures towards disability inclusive city design.",https://doi.org/10.3390/SU12041378,article

Building on a collaboration between the University of Oxford and Addis Ababa University we examined thousands of comments made by Ethiopians on Facebook during four months around the time of the country's general election. Hate speech – defined as statements to incite others to discriminate or act against individuals or groups on grounds of their ethnicity, nationality, religion or gender – was found in just 0.7% of overall statements in the representative sample. These findings may have wide implications for the many countries trying to address growing concerns about the role played by social media in promoting radicalisation or violence. Ethiopia represented an exceptional case study because of its distinct languages, which allowed gaining a realistic sample of the overall online debates focused on one country. We analysed Facebook statements made by Ethiopians, both in their homeland and abroad, in the run-up to and just after the general election on 24 May 2015. We found that fans or followers rather than people with any real influence online are mainly responsible for the violent or aggressive speech that appeared on Facebook pages in the sample. These individuals appear to use Facebook to vent their anger against more powerful sections of society. Around 18% of total comments in the sample were written by fans or followers compared with 11% of comments made by highly influential speakers (the owners of web pages). One fifth (21.8%) of hostile comments were grounded in political differences, only slightly higher than the overall average of 21.4% of all conversations containing hostile comments. Religion and ethnicity provoked fewer hostile comments (10% and 14% of overall comments in sample respectively). The findings are based on the analysis of more than 13,000 statements posted on 1,055 Facebook pages between February and June 2015. They mapped Facebook profiles, pages, and groups that had 100 or more followers or likes or members, respectively. All content in the sample studied had to include an Ethiopian language and raise discussion topics about Ethiopia.

Effective disaster management systems and processes are critical for saving lives and protecting properties. However, the lack of integration between heterogeneous systems and entities involved in disaster management impacts coordination and operational efficiency. Greater integration and coordination among multiple heterogeneous entities is essential in improving performance and achieving network-centric disaster management. To address this gap, this paper, first examines the dimensions of analysis and a framework for a system-of-systems assessment of disaster management. In the proposed framework, the main entities include stakeholders, operations, resources, information, and infrastructure. Second, a metanetwork framework was employed to capture the network interactions among various types of entities. Then, measures of network efficiency (e.g., operational and coordination efficiency) were used to identify critical entities and evaluate the effectiveness of system integration strategies. The application of the proposed framework was shown in a case study of disaster management processes in the 2017 Hurricane Harvey. The findings highlight the importance of the SoS approach for evaluating the performance of disaster management processes under different disaster-induced perturbations (e.g., resources limitation, infrastructure disruptions, and lack of information).

To ease our day-to-day activity, WSNs have become an integral tool for complex data gathering tasks. Monitoring a phenomenon by a WSN depends on the collective data provided by the sensor nodes. To ensure reliable operation of WSNs, it is important to quantify the performance of such networks in terms of network reliability measures. This article studies the reliability of WSNs with multistate nodes and proposes an approach to evaluate the flow-oriented network reliability of WSNs consisting of multistate sensor nodes. The proposed method takes into account the dynamic state of the network due to multistate sensor nodes. The proposed approach includes enumeration of shortest minimal paths from application-specific flow satisfying sensor nodes (source nodes) to the sink node. It then proposes a modified sum-of-disjoint products approach to evaluate WSN reliability in the presence of multistate nodes from the enumerated shortest minimal paths.

In this case study of the Mobile Technology for Health (MOTECH) program in Ghana, we assess the platform's effectiveness in delivering messages, along with user response across sites in five districts from 2011 to 2014. Methods: MOTECH is comprised of ""Client Data Application (CDA) which allows providers to digitize and track service delivery information for women and infants and ""Mobile Midwife"" (MM) which sends automated educational voice messages to the mobile phones of pregnant and postpartum women. Using a naturalist study design, we draw upon system generated data to evaluate message delivery, client engagement, and provider responsiveness to MOTECH over time and by level of facility. Results: A total of 7,370 women were enrolled in MM during pregnancy and 14,867 women were enrolled postpa1rtum. While providers were able to register and upload patient-level health information using CDA, the majority of these uploads occurred in Community-based facilities versus Health Centers. For MM, 25% or less of expected messages were received by pregnant women, despite the majority (>77%) owning a private mobile phone. While over 80% of messages received by pregnant women were listened to, postpartum rates of listening declined over time. Only 25% of pregnant women received and listened to at least 1 first trimester message. By 6-12 months postpartum, less than 6% of enrolled women were exposed to at least one message. Conclusions: Caution should be exercised in assuming that digital health programs perform as intended. Evaluations should measure the technological, behavioral, health systems, and/or community factors which may lead to breaks in the impact pathway and influence findings on effectiveness. The MOTECH platform's technological limitations in 'pushing' out voice messages highlights the need for more timely use of data to mitigate delivery challenges and improve exposure to health information.

The study suggests that social sustainability arises through the congruence among the interrelated components of social innovation, societal demand and social stakeholders in a transformation model and it can be assessed to whether and how this congruence addresses to the equity principles. Design/methodology/approach: The study provides a case analysis on two selected hospitality e-distributors – Booking.com and Airbnb. The data obtained from a video-based content on managerial interviews were triangulated with the data of corporate disclosures and expert views derived from a focus group study. Findings: The study reveals that both companies affect the intra-generational, procedural and geographical equity principles across physical and virtual communities so long as they take the advantage of their strategic positions. While Booking.com transforms its own industry, Airbnb disrupts the entire system by blurring the boundaries between market and non-market as well as touristic and non-touristic areas. Practical implications: The study contributes to the practitioners by showing how to configure and assess the social sustainability of their organizations at the different contexts. Social implications: The study provides a holistic perspective on social sustainability by linking the concept with social innovation, societal demand and social stakeholders and highlighting its contribution to equity principles. Originality/value: Despite the proliferation of studies, the authors have very little understanding on the social pillar of sustainability. The current study fills the gap by addressing these conceptualization and measurement challenges in the literature.",https://doi.org/10.1108/SAMPJ-02-2019-0035,article
"Hallegatte, St{\'{e",2014.0,{Modeling the role of inventories and heterogeneity in the assessment of the economic costs of natural disasters,"Estimates of the cost of potential disasters, including indirect economic consequences, are an important input in the design of risk management strategies. The adaptive regional input-output (ARIO) inventory model is a tool to assess indirect disaster losses and to analyze their drivers. It is based on an input-output structure, but it also (i) explicitly represents production bottlenecks and input scarcity and (ii) introduces inventories as an additional flexibility in the production system. This modeling strategy distinguishes between (i) essential supplies that cannot be stocked (e.g., electricity, water) and whose scarcity can paralyze all economic activity; (ii) essential supplies that can be stocked at least temporarily (e.g., steel, chemicals), whose scarcity creates problems only over the medium term; and (iii) supplies that are not essential in the production process, whose scarcity is problematic only over the long run and are therefore easy to replace with imports. The model is applied to the landfall of Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana and identifies two periods in the disaster aftermath: (1) the first year, during which production bottlenecks are responsible for large output losses; (2) the rest of the reconstruction period, during which bottlenecks are inexistent and output losses lower. This analysis also suggests important research questions and policy options to mitigate disaster-related output losses. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1111/RISA.12090,article
"Wei, Guoan",2023.0,{Modelling a Sustainable Smart City Based on Human and User Centred Design,"A smart, sustainable city that employs ICTs (information and communication technologies) improves urban businesses and services' quality of life, productivity, and competitiveness. A sustainable smart city's significant challenges are legislation and regulations, financing, technical and infrastructural dimensions. While at the same time providing for the economic, social, environmentally, and cultural needs of the present and future generations. Continuous population and urban development have stepped up creative ways of tackling urbanization, with limited implications supporting smart cities' environments. This cram aimed to build a user-centred design using a sustainable big data analytics assisted optimization framework (SBDAAO) to step up creative ways of tackling urbanization with limited environmental implications. This research represents a first move to provide perspectives and value in creating intelligent cities to instil sustainability. Simulation analysis has been carried out based on the data collected based on city infrastructure. The experimental results have been executed, and the suggested method achieves an accuracy ratio (98.2%), the efficiency ratio (95.5%), energy consumption (20.1%), average communication delay (17.6%), and renewable power (93.9 %).",https://doi.org/10.13052/SPEE1048-5236.4218,article
"Mentzas, Gregory and Halaris, Christos and Kavadias, Stylianos",2001.0,{Modelling business processes with workflow systems: An evaluation of alternative approaches,"Effective business process management necessitates a consistent information flow between the participants in the process, the smooth integration of the flow of work, the timely sharing of data and information during the planning and implementation phases and harmonious support for the collaborative aspects of work. The recent trends in the development of advanced workflow management systems and technologies seem to be of crucial importance for facilitating these tasks within the process management context. However, workflow management systems (WfMS) follow various approaches in modelling the flow of work and hence present varying functionalities when supporting enterprise processes. The present paper examines the ways in which workflow technology may facilitate the implementation of process management, reviews the pros and cons of adopting alternative workflow representation techniques in modelling business processes and provides guidance to managers as to the characteristics, the similarities and differences of the various workflow modelling schemes. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/S0268-4012(01)00005-6,article
"An, Youngsoo and Wan, Li",2018.0,{Modelling industrial firm relocation with impacts of spatial dependence,"The location choice of industrial firms has been studied extensively. However the relocation choice of industrial firm remains under-researched. In this study, we develop a multinomial logit model for firm relocation choices that considers both origin and destination attributes. The proposed model is empirically estimated with firm registration data for the Seoul Metropolitan Area. The estimation results show that the network distance for relocation is an important factor for manufacturing firms; reduced land costs is likely to be a significant economic factor in relocation choice of manufacturing firms. In terms of the impacts of spatial dependence, we clarify two types of spatial dependence in literature, i.e. the neighbourhood effects from contiguous locations and the extended spatial spillovers in agglomeration economy. Our test shows that both the neighbourhood and agglomeration effects are significant for high-tech industry, but not for heavy industry. Sensitive tests are carried out to determine the optimum catchment radius for measuring the agglomeration effects for each manufacturing firm types. We also investigate the possible relocation choice variance among manufacturing firms of different employment size.",https://doi.org/10.1080/12265934.2017.1352475,article
"Lombardi, Patrizia and Giordano, Silvia and Farouh, Hend and Yousef, Wael",2012.0,{Modelling the smart city performance,"This paper aims to offer a profound analysis of the interrelations between smart city components connecting the cornerstones of the triple helix. The triple helix model has emerged as a reference framework for the analysis of knowledge-based innovation systems, and relates the multiple and reciprocal relationships between the three main agencies in the process of knowledge creation and capitalization: university, industry and government. This analysis of the triple helix will be augmented using the Analytic Network Process to model, cluster and begin measuring the performance of smart cities. The model obtained allows interactions and feedbacks within and between clusters, providing a process to derive ratio scales priorities from elements. This offers a more truthful and realistic representation for supporting policy-making. The application of this model is still to be developed, but a full list of indicators, available at urban level, has been identified and selected from literature review. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1080/13511610.2012.660325,article
"Isaac, Nikita and Sampath, Naveenaa and Gay, Valerie",2018.0,{Modernising Asthma Management: Personalised Asthma Action Plans Using a Smartphone Application,"Asthma is a chronic disease affecting one in nine Australians. With symptoms such as coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath. Asthma can significantly impact a patient's quality of life. Asthma action plans are said to be one of the most effective asthma interventions available. However, in Australia only one in five people aged 15 and over, with asthma, have a written asthma action plan. Even less of which, refer to their plan. A review of related literature and work showed a gap regarding accessibility of information on asthma action plans in a written form. In an attempt to mitigate this problem, this paper focuses on the design and development of a smartphone application. The application is currently a high-fidelity prototype designed and built using proto.io.software. In addition to this conversion, the application incorporates aspects of the Internet of Things (IoT) whereby realtime data regarding environmental triggers such as temperature, humidity and pollen in surroundings, can be accessed from the application. The application ultimately aims to help asthmatics improve their health and quality of life by providing them, or their carer with the knowledge needed to better understand and manage their asthma, when and where they need it.",https://doi.org/10.1109/ISMICT.2018.8573707,article
"Bhuiyan, Shahjahan H.",2011.0,{Modernizing Bangladesh public administration through e-governance: Benefits and challenges,"More and more public administration emphasizes how Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can be used to support transformational change in governmental functions globally to achieve efficiency and cost-effective service delivery to citizens. Bangladesh public administration employs energies to achieve this goal. Experience in some developing countries has shown that e-governance can improve transparency which leads to, among other things, corruption control and poverty reduction. This article examines the role that e-governance can play in the modernization of public administration for efficient and effective service delivery to the citizens of Bangladesh, as well as its potential to control corruption and reduce poverty. Based on the lessons learned from successful practices in developing countries and literature review, it suggests that e-governance can play a significant role for corruption control and poverty reduction, and thus offers opportunities to cost-effective service delivery to the citizens in Bangladesh. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.GIQ.2010.04.006,article

We have systematically developed and extensively evaluated a procedure to extract total nucleic acids from used malaria RDTs. The co-extraction of DNA and RNA molecules from small volumes of dried blood retained on the RDTs allows detection and quantification of P. falciparum parasites from asymptomatic patients with parasite densities as low as 1 Pf/µL blood using reverse transcription quantitative PCR. Based on the extraction protocol we have developed the ENAR (Extraction of Nucleic Acids from RDTs) approach; a complete workflow for large-scale molecular malaria surveillance. Using RDTs collected during a malaria indicator survey we demonstrated that ENAR provides a powerful tool to analyze nucleic acids from thousands of RDTs in a standardized and high-throughput manner. We found several, known and new, non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in the propeller region of the kelch 13 gene among isolates circulating on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-69268-5,article
"Barron, Peter and Tanna, Gaurang and Benjamin, Peter and Fogwill, Thomas",2016.0,{MomConnect : an exemplar implementation of the Health Normative Standards Framework in South Africa,"In August 2014, the National Department of Health implemented MomConnect as a national digital maternal health program that implements the South African mobile health (mHealth) strategy and the National Health Normative Standards Framework for Interoperability in electronic health (eHealth). As the first digital health program communicating with people at scale, MomConnect enrolled more than half a million women from all regions of the country in the first year of operation, representing approximately half the number of pregnancies in the public health sector. MomConnect uses a mobile phone application to support a pregnancy registration system in antenatal care facilities, allowing pregnant women to receive stage-based messages to help them improve their health and that of their babies. Women can self-subscribe or be subscribed by community health workers to receive a limited set of health-promotion messages. Registered users interact with the system by rating the service received, asking questions, and submitting compliments or complaints. The mobile system connects to a central health-information exchange that facilitates interoperability between digital health applications and includes data validation, a national pregnancy registry and a monitoring and reporting system. Used throughout the health system at facility level, MomConnect has generated a national register of pregnant individuals and set up a national feedback system to clients. As such, it is an exemplar implementation of the Health Normative Standards Framework enabling national-level innovation as a model for future health system strengthening, enabling interoperability between digital health applications, and achieving universal health coverage. MomConnect has drawn global attention due to its innovative features and its avoidance of many of the common pitfalls when implementing digital health projects at scale in low-resource settings. This chapter focuses on the design and development of the technical infrastructure supporting MomConnect.",https://doi.org/10.10520/EJC189313,article
"Tewell, Jordan and O'Sullivan, Dympna and Maiden, Neil and Lockerbie, James and Stumpf, Simone",2019.0,{Monitoring meaningful activities using small low-cost devices in a smart home,"A challenge associated with an ageing population is increased demand on health and social care, creating a greater need to enable persons to live independently in their own homes. Ambient assistant living technology aims to address this by monitoring occupants' ‘activities of daily living' using smart home sensors to alert caregivers to abnormalities in routine tasks and deteriorations in a person's ability to care for themselves. However, there has been less focus on using sensing technology to monitor a broader scope of so-called ‘meaningful activities', which promote a person's emotional, creative, intellectual, and spiritual needs. In this paper, we describe the development of a toolkit comprised of off-the-shelf, affordable sensors to allow persons with dementia and Parkinson's disease to monitor meaningful activities as well as activities of daily living in order to self-manage their life and well-being. We describe two evaluations of the toolkit, firstly a lab-based study to test the installation of the system including the acuity and placement of sensors and secondly, an in-the-wild study where subjects who were not target users of the toolkit, but who identified as technology enthusiasts evaluated the feasibility of the toolkit to monitor activities in and around real homes. Subjects from the in-the-wild study reported minimal obstructions to installation and were able to carry out and enjoy activities without obstruction from the sensors, revealing that meaningful activities may be monitored remotely using affordable, passive sensors. We propose that our toolkit may enhance assistive living systems by monitoring a wider range of activities than activities of daily living.",https://doi.org/10.1007/S00779-019-01223-2,article
V{\'{e,2021.0,{Moral zombies: why algorithms are not moral agents,"In philosophy of mind, zombies are imaginary creatures that are exact physical duplicates of conscious subjects for whom there is no first-personal experience. Zombies are meant to show that physicalism—the theory that the universe is made up entirely out of physical components—is false. In this paper, I apply the zombie thought experiment to the realm of morality to assess whether moral agency is something independent from sentience. Algorithms, I argue, are a kind of functional moral zombie, such that thinking about the latter can help us better understand and regulate the former. I contend that the main reason why algorithms can be neither autonomous nor accountable is that they lack sentience. Moral zombies and algorithms are incoherent as moral agents because they lack the necessary moral understanding to be morally responsible. To understand what it means to inflict pain on someone, it is necessary to have experiential knowledge of pain. At most, for an algorithm that feels nothing, ‘values' will be items on a list, possibly prioritised in a certain way according to a number that represents weightiness. But entities that do not feel cannot value, and beings that do not value cannot act for moral reasons.",https://doi.org/10.1007/S00146-021-01189-X,article

One area of development has been the use of low-cost sensors to complement (or in some cases, substitute for) regulatory monitoring of ambient air pollution. As part of a bigger integrated approach to monitoring cities, such as Urban Observatories, disparate live data streams can now readily be collated and disseminated via a platform to facilitate the use of hyperlocal data for real-time decision making whilst supporting longer term sustainable development goals. Urban digital twins are the next logical step on this journey and these are becoming increasingly popular as a tool, at least conceptually, to better interpret this data as well as better understand the consequences of management interventions. To date, there are few examples of true digital twins of environmental challenges with many limited to the ‘digital shadow' stage of development, characterized by lack of bi-directional feedback between the digital model and physical world. Urban Observatories present an opportunity to change this by providing the often overlooked, but crucial, underpinning foundations of urban digital twins. This paper focuses on the utilization of live stream data and demonstrates that air quality applications can provide a realistic target given the density of observations available, which can routinely be combined with other urban datasets to provide the added value and insights needed for urban air pollution management. However, the availability and standardization of live streams of big data is a major challenge and there are issues with interoperability, metadata management, communicating uncertainty, network longevity, data ownership and transparency. This paper contributes insights concerning how to overcome these challenges and calls for common practice in generating and managing live streams of big data.",https://doi.org/10.3389/FRSC.2024.1500516/FULL,article
{Di Bernardo,2023.0,{Moving towards a people-centric smart city,"European cities are getting smarter. Smart technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Everything (IoE), and other AI-based technologies, are being injected more directly into the lives of citizens. Smart cities are seen as evolving ecosystems in which multiple actors act, react and interact over time to foster innovative solutions and provide better services for citizens. Despite the growing interest, existing research has to make key advances, important gaps persist as scholars lag behind theoretical development and rarely take into account the most important element of a city: people. Business and management scholars have focused on how to define strategies in smart cities, local policy, and others investigated the challenges of building a smart city. Few concerns deal with humans. In addressing these shortcomings, we tried to highlight why any smart city should be a community that learns, adapts, co-creates, and innovates. The purpose of this study is to investigate the human perspective that goes beyond the focus on technology related to smart cities in Europe, through an analysis in depth on how and how much citizens make cities smart. The focus is on people and their well-being combined with the shared knowledge and development that arises from each player in the ecosystem. To get an overall vision of the people-centric smart city we carry out an exploratory literature review with a PRISMA protocol that guides the identification of the studies to be included in the review. We finally provide implications for scholars and practitioners and suggest future research opportunities.",https://doi.org/10.1051/ITMCONF/20235102003,article

P. and Madaan, Jitendra",2020.0,{Moving towards smart cities: Solutions that lead to the Smart City Transformation Framework,"A city is a large and permanent human ecosystem which provides a lot of services and opportunities to its citizens. The rapid urbanization and increasing population have put a lot of strains on city infrastructures and service deliveries. The current urbanization requires strong strategies and innovative planning to modernize the urban life. Many cities are enhancing quality and performance of urban services by being digitalized, intelligent and smarter. The policymakers and city authorities are exploring solutions to deliver the new services in an efficient, responsive and sustainable manner for a large population. The study explores all the possible services among various city dimensions which can make a city smart. The ideas related to smart services are collected from the peer vetted creative crowdsourcing process performed online in India. A directed qualitative conventional content analysis is used to analyze the collected ideas. The unique ideas are clustered into 19 different service categories. The findings suggest multi-dimensional service classification along with required basic infrastructural development. Further, the Smart City Transformation Framework (SCTF) is proposed to help the policy makers, urban developers, government officials and service providers in terms of understanding and to draw more insights from the suggested smart solutions for development of smart cities. There are four key areas (Planning, Physical infrastructure, ICT infrastructure and Deploying Smart solutions) discussed in the proposed framework to illustrate the city transformation. The proposed SCTF is supported by literature and examples adopted by various smart cities across the world to illustrate its effectiveness. Moreover, a mind map is designed to illustrate the interrelationships among the collected ideas in an attractive and procedural visualization for city transformation process.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.TECHFORE.2018.04.024,article

Conceptualizing, designing, implementing, validating, and evaluating solutions to urban challenges with all relevant stakeholders around the table are perceived as the optimal modus operandi in these perspectives. But how does this vision relate to current practices in cities? This paper deals with the observed trend toward more multi-stakeholder collaboration and the resulting complex value networks these stakeholders need to navigate. This is exemplified in what has been called the “platformization” of the urban space by “urban service platforms” (e.g., Uber, AirBnB) as well as in so-called “quadruple helix” approaches to urban innovation. Particularly for (local) government, finding a role in these complex networks has proven challenging.

Smart technology is considered a key lever for community well-being that should be associated with human and management skills to foster the emergence of sustainable growth. A literature review on the key areas of smart communities was performed to identify a gap in extant research related to the scarcity of studies examining the strategic role of governance in communities. Then, the main ecosystems elements were introduced to show the suitability of this theory for the introduction of an integrated view based on multi-level governance and service ecosystems. Findings from the case study on the TrentoSmartCity allowed the development of a theoretical framework that identified the main drivers for sustainable growth in smart communities by showing the need to introduce a meta-level to address the harmonizing role of governance. Thus, the study detected, firstly, the main ecosystem's elements involved in Trento communities and, secondly, how multi-level governance could strategically manage these elements for the harmonization of multi-stakeholder's objectives to attain social growth. The identification of the strategic drivers for sustainable development in smart communities as well as the main decision-making and policy-making steps could help scholars and practitioners shed light on the key role of entrepreneurship and governance in the development of sustainable innovation.",https://doi.org/10.1007/S11365-020-00641-6,article

Design Two-group longitudinal randomized control trial. Setting Community. Participants Individuals aged 65 and older without signs of dementia or symptoms of severe depression who were self-managing prescribed medication. Measurements After 4 weeks of initial adherence monitoring using a medication event monitoring system, individuals with 90% or less adherence were randomly assigned to groups. Intervention The prospective memory intervention was designed to provide strategies that switch older adults from relying on executive function and working memory processes (that show effects of cognitive aging) to mostly automatic associative processes (that are relatively spared with normal aging) for remembering to take medications. Strategies included establishing a routine, establishing cues strongly associated with medication taking actions, performing the action immediately upon thinking about it, using a medication organizer, and imagining medication taking to enhance encoding and improve cuing. Results There was significant improvement in adherence in the intervention group (57% at baseline to 78% after the intervention), but most of these gains were lost after 5 months. The control condition started at 68% and was stable during the intervention, but dropped to 62%. Executive function and working memory moderated the intervention effect, with the intervention producing greater benefit for those with lower executive function and working memory.

These characteristics are challenged in the academic literature, especially the technocentric approach and the central position of private companies. Moreover, the lack of proper conceptualisation pushes cities to claim themselves ‘smart'. Finally, there are few rigorous analytical or statistical analyses of the concept and its application to territories. Therefore, this paper studies how Belgian municipalities understand the concept of Smart Cities in 2016. Based on the groundwork of literature on Smart Cities and the results of a survey of 113 Belgian municipalities, a typology of four understandings of the Smart City (technological, societal, comprehensive and non-existent) is elaborated. The results also show that municipalities with no understanding of the Smart City concept or with a technical understanding are mostly located in small and rural municipalities. This could be a sign of rejection of the phenomenon in this context. Conversely, medium and large-sized municipalities mostly develop a societal or comprehensive understanding. Therefore, this study highlights a dichotomy of understanding and acceptance of the concept of the Smart City between peripheral (rural and small size municipalities) and central municipalities (urban, medium and large size municipalities).",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.TECHFORE.2018.10.029,article

In this article, we empirically examine the relationship between objective e-government performance on the supply side and the perceptions of citizens on the demand side. A multilevel analysis of over 28,000 respondents across 32 European countries reveals that highly ranked e-government is warmly welcomed by citizens, suggesting that the supply and demand sides of e-government are, in part, consistent. Specifically, the e-government performance–satisfaction correlations in e-service and e-participation are more prominent than that of e-information. The results also show that citizens' perceived e-government benefits are mainly from using online services. While e-government rankings are reasonably predictive of citizen satisfaction, they should be referred to with caveats in e-government policies. Points for practitioners: The empirical findings reveal that objective e-government performance is partially congruent with citizens' satisfaction and perceived benefits. While e-government rankings may not be good predictors of citizen use, they do coincide, in part, with citizen satisfaction. Ubiquitous e-government benchmarks can be referred to as reliable gauges of citizen satisfaction, though their susceptibility varies across the purposes of e-government use. The various benefits that citizens perceived from e-government are primarily derived through online services instead of electronic information or participation, and the government should pay more attention to e-service development in order to bring more benefits to its users.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0020852317703691,article

"Lafortezza, Raffaele and Sanesi, Giovanni",2019.0,{Nature-based solutions: Settling the issue of sustainable urbanization,"Rapid urbanization presents one of the most urgent challenges of our times. Cities must cope with poor air quality, heat island effects, increased flood risk and the frequency/severity of extreme events (e.g., droughts and heat waves), increasing crime and social inequity, poverty and degraded urban environments, amongst other negative consequences. Climate change adaptation and mitigation as well as sustainable management are therefore key challenges for cities in Europe and around the world. What must be developed therefore is a robust, wide evidence-base and reference framework of nature-based solutions (NBS) – measures that mimic the complex features and processes of natural ecosystems – for local/regional city authorities and other policy and decision makers to increase climate resilience and address inclusive urban regeneration in cities. In response to this need, we propose an applicative framework for NBS using the structure of the DPSIR (Driving force–Pressure–State–Impact–Response) model, in conformity with European Community standards. Indeed, under the umbrella of the EC's Framework Program – Horizon 2020 – international institutions, scientific experts and policy makers worldwide are seeking to increase collaboration with cities to enhance ecosystem services and develop the evidence-base for the economic, social and environmental benefits of nature-based solutions. They are eager to exchange knowledge and inspire positive action for nature in urban areas to meet their growing social and environmental challenges. The time has come to acknowledge NBS as the most fitting response to the numerous challenges posed by our changing climate and for the realization of sustainable and healthy cities. It is hoped that this article will pioneer others in settling the issue for NBS as the undisputable answer to challenged urban landscapes and societies globally.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.ENVRES.2018.12.063,article

New communication technologies have played a vital role in changes traditional urbanization into a smarter and comfort zone for the citizen. Due to various systems and integration of several new standards and systems, the smart cities have suffered from various open challenges related to technologies, system controlling and management, scalability and security concerns. The new concepts of nature-inspired solutions have implemented to deal with smart cities' challenges by more optimization and performance-oriented methods. Therefore, this paper aims to handle at least three areas of smart cities including smart mobility, smart living and security provision by developing three nature-inspired solutions. The three proposed solutions are dragon clustering mobility in IoV, moth flame electric management for smart living and ant colony-based intrusion detection system for security provision. These solutions are based on a dragonfly, moth flame and ant colony optimization techniques. The proposed solutions are evaluated in a simulation to check the performance. These solutions will help new researchers to explore the nature-inspired solutions to tackle the new and complex systems of smart cities.",https://doi.org/10.1007/S00521-020-04900-Z,article

However, there remains a lack of clarity in its definition and scholars argue that this can impacting the legitimacy of addressing social sustainability challenges. Through a systematic literature review and a content analysis, we shed light on the multifaceted discourse surrounding the concept of social sustainability, elucidating its diverse applications and meanings portrayed and defined within scholarly discourse. Our findings show that the concept predominantly revolves around four prevalent categories: “Equity,” “Well-being,” “Participation and Influence,” and ‘Social Capital. Based on results, we develop and present a novel analytical framework of the four pillars of social sustainability, referred to as the “SoSuCompass,” representing a conceptual framework to clarify the concept's multifaceted nature. The framework can serve as a tool for a fuller comprehension of the definition of social sustainability.",https://doi.org/10.1002/SD.2982,article

Our point of departure is the operationalization of three intertwined trends associated with the conceptualizations of participation, mediatisation and (multi-sided) platformisation. Through the examination of (social) traffic and navigation application, Waze, we explore manifestations of (contested) dynamics in mobility practices occurring between commerce and community in the public space of the city. The preliminary findings point to the emergence of new socio-spatial constructs which afford a better frame of ‘what is going on' challenging the smart city framework as a planning and development paradigm.

A smart city uses cutting-edge technologies to improve the quality, performance and interactivity of urban services, optimize resources, and foster sustainable and well-connected societies. A critical component within this paradigm is the domain of transportation, where the application of artificial intelligence is fundamentally transforming how we navigate our cities. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive exploration of the evolving landscape of AI within the context of intelligent mobility and smart cities, with a specific focus on our contributions in this field. This investigation not only highlights the advances in this field but also focuses specifically on the significant contributions of Autonomous Mobility and Perception Lab (AMPL) to deploying AI in developing intelligent mobility solutions. As urban areas worldwide grapple with the complexities of growing populations and the increasing demand for efficient, sustainable transportation, the critical role of implementing smart city concepts, especially intelligent mobility systems, becomes evident.

This implies a mismatch between the ways ‘experts' and decision-makers conceive and plan transitional housing and the ways people perceive, experience and use them. This paper explores the use of a housing pathways framework to improve our understanding of the multiple ways in which transitional housing is perceived, experienced and used by disaster-affected people in low-income cities. For illustrating this point, we focus on the case of the city of Sarpol-e Zahab in Iran that was struck by an earthquake measuring 7.3 on the Richter scale in 2017. The paper relies on a fieldwork study conducted in 2017–2018 in the city. This case provides a number of insights, in particular given that the state programs provided two options of cash grant and pre-fabricated units to households for transitional housing. In addition to reporting transitional housing activities in the city, we show that the four identified housing pathways in this city account for pre- and post-earthquake structural forces as well as households' own choices and strategies for adaptation. Highlighting how households' post-disaster trajectories were influenced by different aspects of post-disaster policies and interventions, the paper concludes with some recommendations for transitional housing programs in the context of lower-income cities.",https://doi.org/10.1007/S10901-021-09918-W,article

To assess the impact of neighborhood walkability on body mass index (BMI) trajectories of urban Canadians. Methods. Data are from Canada's National Population Health Survey (n = 2935; biannual assessments 1994-2006). We measured walkability with the Walk Score. We modeled body mass index (BMI, defined as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters [kg/m2]) trajectories as a function of Walk Score and sociodemographic and behavioral covariates with growth curve models and fixed-effects regression models. Results. In men, BMI increased annually by an average of 0.13 kg/m2 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.11, 0.14) over the 12 years of follow-up. Moving to a high-walkable neighborhood (2 or more Walk Score quartiles higher) decreased BMI trajectories for men by approximately 1 kg/m2 (95% CI = -1.16, -0.17). Moving to a low-walkable neighborhood increased BMI for men by approximately 0.45 kg/m2 (95% CI = 0.01, 0.89). There was no detectable influence of neighborhood walkability on body weight for women. Conclusions. Our study of a large sample of urban Canadians followed for 12 years confirms that neighborhood walkability influences BMI trajectories for men, and may be influential in curtailing male age-related weight gain.",https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2016.303096,article

However, the patterns and aspects of social support through SNSs have not been reported and their influence on other social-cognitive factors remains inconclusive. Objective: Our objective is to explore how social support delivered through SNSs impacts interactions among Korean-Chinese (KC) middle-aged women and to identify how this approach influences social-cognitive factors for exercise (eg, sense of community, self-efficacy for exercise, and social support for exercise). Methods: A mixed methods design was used. Text analysis of SNS messages and text mining using the Korean Natural Language Application (KoALA) were conducted. Social-cognitive factors (eg, sense of community, self-efficacy for exercise, and social support for exercise) were assessed at baseline and after 12 weeks using a structured questionnaire. A comparison of social-cognitive factors at baseline and at 12 weeks was conducted to identify any potential significant changes, using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results: A total of 259 SNS messages were collected from 24 KC women, distributed among four chat groups, who participated in a 12-week walking intervention program between August and October 2018. The individual average frequency of chatting via the SNS was 10.79 (range 0-34) and the most frequent type of social support through the SNS was network support (172/259, 66.4%). The most common words extracted from the SNS were Health, Exercise, Participation, and We. Overall, the perceived levels of sense of community (P<.001) and social support for exercise (P=.002) were significantly increased at 12 weeks compared with baseline. Group 1 (P=.03) and Group 4 (P=.03), whose members demonstrated the highest frequency of network support, experienced a significant increase only in the level of sense of community. Conclusions: By integrating these data and conducting a mixed methods analysis, we observed that among the types of social support, network support was a key point for the promotion of social-cognitive factors in increasing exercise adherence. Therefore, network support through SNS-based interventions should be considered as a useful strategy to help vulnerable migrant populations make changes to exercise behaviors.",https://doi.org/10.2196/19159,article

The resulting transaction sequences---balance-respecting trajectories---are data objects that represent observed monetary flows. Common sequential motifs correspond to known use-cases of mobile money: digital payments, digital transfers, and money storage. We find that each activity creates a distinct network structure within the system, and we uncover coordinated gaming of the mobile money provider's commission schedule. Moreover, we find that e-money passes through the system in anywhere from minutes to months. This pronounced heterogeneity, even within the same use-case, can inform the modeling of turnover in money supply.

In India, in particular, there has been a move towards building 100 new smart cities in the future in order to spur economic growth and urbanization. Using the case of Dholera, the first Indian smart city, I examine how global models of smart cities are provincialized in the regional state of Gujarat through local histories, politics and laws. First, I argue that Dholera smart city is part of a longer genealogy of utopian urban planning that emerged as a response to the challenges of development and modernity in post-independent India. Second, that Dholera highlights a shift towards an ‘entrepreneurial urbanization' in a regional state interested in scaling up a ‘Gujarat model of development' for emulation at the scale of the nation. Finally, that in Dholera ‘speed' is a relative term across its scales of manifestation from the global to local, where short ‘bursts of speed' in conceptualization and investment is matched by significant ‘bottlenecks' via local protests.

While all of them address different visions and needs, they share a common theme: How do we manage massive amounts of heterogeneous data, derive knowledge out of them instead of drowning in information, and how do we make our findings reproducible and reusable by others? In a network of knowledge, topics span across scientific disciplines and the idea of domain ontologies as common agreements seems like an illusion. In this work, we argue that these trends require a radical paradigm shift in ontology engineering away from a small number of authoritative, global ontologies developed top-down, to a high number of local ontologies that are driven by application needs and developed bottom-up out of observation data. Similarly as the early Web was replaced by a social Web in which volunteers produce data instead of purely consuming it, the next generation of knowledge infrastructures has to enable users to become knowledge engineers themselves. Surprisingly, existing ontology engineering frameworks are not well suited for this new perspective. Hence, we propose an observation-driven ontology engineering framework, show how its layers can be realized using specific methodologies, and relate the framework to existing work on geo-ontologies. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1467-9671.2012.01342.X,article

Lack of government recognition, also referred to as ""non-notified status"" in the Indian context, may create entrenched barriers to legal rights and basic services such as water, sanitation and security of tenure. In this paper, we explore the relationship between non-notified status and health outcomes in Kaula Bandar, a slum in Mumbai, India. We illustrate this relationship using the findings of a four-year long series of studies in the community. By comparing Kaula Bandar's statistics with those from other Mumbai slums captured by India's National Family Health Survey-3, we show that Kaula Bandar has relative deficiencies in several health and social outcomes, including educational status, child health and adult nutrition. We then provide an explanatory framework for the role that Kaula Bandar's non-notified status may play in generating poor health outcomes, by discussing the health consequences of the absence of basic services. We also highlight the criminalization by the government of activities necessary for fulfilling access to fundamental needs such as water, toilets and shelter. We argue that the policy vacuum surrounding non-notified slums such as Kaula Bandar results in governance failures that lead to poor health outcomes. Our findings highlight the need for cities in India and other developing countries to establish and fulfill minimum humanitarian standards in non-notified slums for the provision of basic services such as water, sanitation, solid waste removal, electricity and education. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1177/0956247812456356,article

Although current devices in use today are also getting more powerful in terms of features and capabilities, but they are still incapable of executing smart, autonomous, and intelligent tasks such as those often required for smart healthcare, ambient assisted living (AAL), virtual reality, augmented reality, intelligent vehicular communication, as well as in many services related to smart cities, Internet of Things (IoT), Tactile Internet, Internet of Vehicles (IoV), and so on. For many of these applications, we need another entity to execute tasks on behalf of the user's device and return the results - a technique often called offloading, where tasks are outsourced and the involved entities work in tandem to achieve the ultimate goal of the application. Task offloading is attractive for emerging IoT and cloud computing applications. It can occur between IoT nodes, sensors, edge devices, or fog nodes. Offloading can be performed based on different factors that include computational requirements of an application, load balancing, energy management, latency management, and so on. We present a taxonomy of recent offloading schemes that have been proposed for domains such as fog, cloud computing, and IoT. We also discuss the middleware technologies that enable offloading in a cloud-IoT cases and the factors that are important for offloading in a particular scenario. We also present research opportunities concerning offloading in fog and edge computing.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.FUTURE.2018.04.057,article
"Selwyn, Neil and Gorard, Stephen and Furlong, John and Madden, Louise",2003.0,{Older adults' use of information and communications technology in everyday life,"Social commentators in countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States are beginning to recognise that encouraging older adults' use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) is essential for the creation of bona fide information societies. To date, however, few studies have examined in detail older adults' access to and use of ICTs. This important aspect of the interaction between population ageing and societal change is more complex than the published literature's portrayal of a dichotomy between 'successful users' and 'unsuccessful non-users'. The paper examines the extent and nature of ICT access and use by older adults in their everyday lives. Information was collected from a sub-sample of 352 adults aged 60 or more years taken from a large household survey of ICT use in England and Wales among 1,001 people. The findings suggest that using a computer is not only a minority activity amongst older adults but also highly stratified by gender, age, marital status and educational background. Conversely, non-use of computers can be attributed to their low relevance and 'relative advantage' to older people. The paper concludes by considering how political and academic assumptions about older people and ICTs might be refocused, away from trying to'change' older adults, and towards involving them in changing ICT.",https://doi.org/10.1017/S0144686X03001302,article

But in practice the agenda is an uncertain one, usually only partially developed, and often more about corporate-led urban development than about urban social justice. Rather than leave smart urbanism to the corporate and political elites, there are opportunities now for critical urban scholarship to not only critique how it is currently constituted, but to give shape to a globally oriented alternative smart urban agenda. An ambition like this means taking the ‘urban' in ‘smart urban' much more seriously. It means foregrounding the knowledges, political priorities and needs of those either actively excluded or included in damaging ways in mainstream smart urban discourses. We outline steps towards an alternative smart urbanism. We seek to move beyond the specific to the general and do so by drawing on radically different initiatives across the Global North and South.

The potential benefits as well as the challenges associated with IoT for cities are discussed. Much of the 'big data' that are continuously generated by IoT sensors, devices, systems and services are geo-tagged or geo-located. The importance of having robust, intelligent geospatial analytics systems in place to process and make sense of such data in real time cannot therefore be overestimated. The authors argue that IoT-powered smart cities stand better chances of becoming healthier cities. The World Health Organization (WHO) Healthy Cities Network and associated national networks have hundreds of member cities around the world that could benefit from, and harness the power of, IoT to improve the health and well-being of their local populations. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1186/1476-072X-13-10,article
"Conradie, Peter and Choenni, Sunil",2014.0,{On the barriers for local government releasing open data,"Due to expected benefits such as citizen participation and innovation, the release of Public Sector Information as open data is getting increased attention on various levels of government. However, currently data release by governments is still novel and there is little experience and knowledge thus far about its benefits, costs and barriers. This is compounded by a lack of understanding about how internal processes influence data release. Our aim in this paper is to get a better understanding of these processes and how they influence data release, i.e., to find determinants for the release of public sector information. For this purpose, we conducted workshops, interviews, questionnaires, desk research and practice based cases in the education program of our university, involving six local public sector organizations. We find that the way data is stored, the way data is obtained and the way data is used by a department are crucial indicators for open data release. We conclude with the lessons learned based on our research findings. These findings are: we should take a nuanced approach towards data release, avoid releasing data for its own sake, and take small incremental steps to explore data release. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.giq.2014.01.003,article

CP was the reply of the industry to the call for sustainable development as launched by the WCED (1987) and further elaborated in Rio's Agenda 21 (UN, 1992). During the past 25 years, the concept was put in practice. During this period it changed in scope, methods, and application area. This provided a deeper socio-economic impact to an idea that was originally launched to awaken industry on its environmental responsibilities. This paper provides a review of essentials that contributed to the fundamental changes in CP during the most recent quarter of a century. It takes off with a review of CP definitions illustrating the changes of the content. Changes in scope are exemplified with the increasing importance of “Corporate Social Responsibility” (CSR). This includes that post-modern companies have not only responsibilities on their economic performance and the environment, but should also act on issues including human rights and resources, business ethics, and community involvement. The links between CP and green and circular economy are indicated. The CP approach is increasingly applied outside the industry. CP for sustainable tourism is discussed in more detail but is only an example of the wider application in e.g. agriculture or health services. This widening of contents necessitates more and better-adapted methods supporting the measurement of the CP components. Indicators, assessment strategies, and green accounting are increasingly improved and used more specifically and frequently. This evolution is discussed in a context of a dilution of the original environmental targets in a wider, more societal scope and the transition towards a more responsible, proactive and reliable management of the sectors applying CP.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.11.082,article
"Bibri, Simon Elias",2019.0,{On the sustainability of smart and smarter cities in the era of big data: an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary literature review,"There has recently been a conscious push for cities across the globe to be smart and even smarter and thus more sustainable by developing and implementing big data technologies and their applications across various urban domains in the hopes of reaching the required level of sustainability and improving the living standard of citizens. Having gained momentum and traction as a promising response to the needed transition towards sustainability and to the challenges of urbanisation, smart and smarter cities as approaches to data-driven urbanism are increasingly adopting the advanced forms of ICT to improve their performance in line with the goals of sustainable development and the requirements of urban growth. One of such forms that has tremendous potential to enhance urban operations, functions, services, designs, strategies, and policies in this direction is big data analytics and its application. This is due to the kind of well-informed decision-making and enhanced insights enabled by big data computing in the form of applied intelligence. However, topical studies on big data technologies and their applications in the context of smart and smarter cities tend to deal largely with economic growth and the quality of life in terms of service efficiency and betterment while overlooking and barely exploring the untapped potential of such applications for advancing sustainability. In fact, smart and smarter cities raise several issues and involve significant challenges when it comes to their development and implementation in the context of sustainability. With that in regard, this paper provides a comprehensive, state-of-the-art review and synthesis of the field of smart and smarter cities in relation to sustainability and related big data analytics and its application in terms of the underlying foundations and assumptions, research issues and debates, opportunities and benefits, technological developments, emerging trends, future practices, and challenges and open issues. This study shows that smart and smarter cities are associated with misunderstanding and deficiencies as regards their incorporation of, and contribution to, sustainability. Nevertheless, as also revealed by this study, tremendous opportunities are available for utilising big data analytics and its application in smart cities of the future to improve their contribution to the goals of sustainable development by optimising and enhancing urban operations, functions, services, designs, strategies, and policies, as well as by finding answers to challenging analytical questions and thereby advancing knowledge forms.

Through the pilot survey, this study will also increase the awareness on the importance of the OI and the creation of sustainable value, and provides the preliminary results to be considered by scholars and practitioners. Results show that climate change, as a planetary boundary, positively stimulates incubated start-ups to improve their technology-driven sustainable value creation.

In this regard, paying special attention to the investigation of main drivers, stakeholders and challenges of the open data movement in Estonia, the author argues that a highly centralized administrative policy that has been widely used previously by authorities in advancing various technology-driven public reforms, which partly explains a truly impressive advance of this Nordic state in e-government, e-commerce, e-banking and evoting, does not necessarily lead to same effective results in the open data domain. On the contrary, the presence of established democratic institutions and developed civil society as well as an incredibly advanced and dynamic private ICTindustry that values competition and professional curiosity along with a very strong sense of patriotism and adherence to a particular neighborhood deeply rooted in Estonian society has played a much more important role in diffusing the concept rather than just traditional government directives and strategies.",https://doi.org/10.1080/02681102.2017.1412289,article

The analysis illustrates that wrangling legacy data is more than a rote technical activity. Our findings suggest that smart governance in practice depends on the ways in which social, organizational, and institutional strategies cope with technical change.

They show that: (1) when civic space closes offline citizens often respond by opening civic space online; (2) when civic space opens online governments often take measures to close online space; and (3) the resulting reduction in digital rights makes it impossible to achieve the kind of inclusive governance defined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We know far more about openings and closings of online civic space in the global North than we do in the global South. What little we do know about Africa is mainly about a single country, a single event, or single technology.

They document 65 examples of the use of digital technologies to open online civic space and 115 examples of techniques used to close online civic space. The five tactics used most often to close online civic space in Africa are digital surveillance, disinformation, internet shutdowns, legislation, and arrests for online speech. The reports show clearly that any comprehensive analysis of digital rights requires consideration of the wider political, civic space, and technological contexts. We argue that countering the threats to democracy and digital rights discussed in the reports requires new evidence, awareness, and capacity.

We live in an era of datafication, one in which life is increasingly quantified and transformed into intelligence for private or public benefit. When used responsibly, this offers new opportunities for public good. The potential of data is evident in the possibilities offered by open data and data collaboratives - both instances of how wider access to data can lead to positive and often dramatic social transformation. However, three key forms of asymmetry currently limit this potential, especially for already vulnerable and marginalized groups: data asymmetries, information asymmetries, and agency asymmetries. These asymmetries limit human potential, both in a practical and psychological sense, leading to feelings of disempowerment and eroding public trust in technology. Existing methods to limit asymmetries (such as open data or consent) as well as some alternatives under consideration (data ownership, collective ownership, personal information management systems) have limitations to adequately address the challenges at hand. A new principle and practice of digital self-determination (DSD) is therefore required. The study and practice of DSD remain in its infancy. The characteristics we have outlined here are only exploratory, and much work remains to be done so as to better understand what works and what does not.

The effectiveness of the schedules recommended by the optimization are evaluated by running a detailed discrete event simulation model of the restoration process with both the optimization-generated schedules and the power company's original schedules, and comparing the resulting restorations according to three measures - average time each customer is without power, time required to restore 90% of customers, and time required to restore 98% of customers.

RESULTS: The average number of LLINs per household was higher in the Bamenda Health District (BHD) compared to the THD (2.5, range; 0 – 6 vs. 2.4, range; 0 – 6) as well as the household ownership of at least one LLIN (93.3% vs. 89.0%). The proportion of the defacto population with universal utilisation was higher in BHD compared to THD (13.1% vs 0.2%). In the multinomial regression analysis, households in the SHD (p = 5.5x10-4, OR; 0.3, 95% C.I; 0.1 – 0.6), were less likely to own at least one LLIN compared to those in THD. 87.1% of household heads admitted that LLINs could be washed, while 50.1% affirmed the correct washing frequency. CONCLUSION: Ownership of LLINs was low in the THD in comparison to the goal of one for every two household members. Overall, LLINs coverage and accessibility was still low after the free mass distribution campaigns (MDCs), as only 14.6% of children 0 – 5 years and 16.1% of the entire population used LLIN the night before the survey.",https://doi.org/10.11604/pamj.2024.48.85.36061,article
{De Lange,2013.0,{Owning the city: New media and citizen engagement in urban design,"Over the last few years, the term 'smart cities' has gained traction in academic, industry, and policy debates about the deployment of new media technologies in urban settings. It is mostly used to describe and market technologies that make city infrastructures more efficient, and personalize the experience of the city. Here, we want to propose the notion of 'ownership' as a lens to take an alternative look at the role of urban new media in the city. With the notion of ownership we seek to investigate how digital media and culture allow citizens to engage with, organize around and act upon collective issues and engage in co-creating the social fabric and built form of the city. Taking ownership as the point of departure, we wish to broaden the debate about the role of new media technologies in urban design from an infrastructural to a social point of view, or from 'city management' to 'city making'. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.5210/FM.V18I11.4954,article

As PLS-SEM is relatively new compared to other multivariate analysis techniques, there are still numerous open questions and uncertainties in its application. This study aims to address this important issue by offering guidance regarding its use in contexts with which researchers struggle. Design/methodology/approach: The authors examine the most prominent questions and answers posed in a well-known PLS-SEM discussion forum. The authors do so by using a text analysis technique to identify the most salient topics. Findings: The data analysis identifies three salient PLS-SEM topics (i.e. bootstrapping and significance testing, higher-order constructs and moderation). Research limitations/implications: The results allow us to address the PLS-SEM community's main methodological issues. The authors discuss each area separately and provide explanations and guidelines. Practical implications: The guidelines on the most important PLS-SEM topics provide decision-making and application aids. In this way, the authors make a decisive contribution to clarifying ambiguities when applying the PLS-SEM method in hospitality management research and other disciplines. Originality/value: There has as yet been no systematic analysis of this kind in the field of PLS-SEM; the authors, therefore, present the first research results.

The government acted swiftly, closed its borders, introduced circuit-breaking measures, and deployed public health and medical expertise in tackling the virus. Both technology and human resources were used extensively for contact tracing, quarantining, and pathogenic management. While all these measures helped in a successful containment initially, the second wave of COVID-19 cases emerged at the foreign worker dormitories, affecting thousands of workers. Singapore's approach in tackling the situation shifted rapidly and began to involve civil society organizations and individuals in the fight against the virus. In this paper, we argue that while state-led technologies such asTraceTogether and Safe Entry helped in the techno-governance of bodies on the move, bottom-up digital solutions, and innovative engagement of individuals are equally crucial in building a smart and resilient Singapore.",https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2020.1807168,article

Access to HIV services remains low among this group although several effective interventions have been documented. It is therefore important to identify what has worked well to increase the reach of HIV services among MSM. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, POPLINE and the Web of Science databases to collect published articles reporting HIV interventions among MSM across sub-Saharan Africa. Covidence was used to review the articles. The review protocol was registered in International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) - CRD42017060808. Results: The search identified 2627 citations, and following removal of duplicates and inclusion and exclusion criteria, only 15 papers were eligible for inclusion in the review. The articles reported various accrual strategies, namely: respondent driven sampling, known peers identified through hotspot or baseline surveys, engagement with existing community-based organizations, and through peer educators contacting MSM in virtual sites. Some programs, however, combined some of these accrual strategies. Peer-led outreach services were indicated to reach and deliver services to more MSM. A combination of peer outreach and mobile clinics increased uptake of health information and services. Health facilities, especially MSM-friendly facilities attract access and use of services by MSM and retention into care. Conclusions: There are various strategies for accrual and delivering services to MSM across SSA. However, each of these strategies have specific strengths and weaknesses necessitating combinations of interventions and integration of the specific context to inform implementation. If the best of intervention content and implementation are used to inform these services, sufficient coverage and impact of HIV prevention and treatment programs for MSM across SSA can be optimized.",https://doi.org/10.1186/S12889-018-5303-2,article

Accordingly, transition towards a fossil fuel free future is not to be understood as a matter of techno-economic innovation but as a process in which the ‘social' and the ‘technical' are inextricably intertwined, and technologies co-evolve with programmes of governing. Research findings from a recent bibliometric study reveal a very different picture where city dwellers are rarely the subject of research into future energy plans for transition towards a fossil future free future. Instead the research publications tend to concentrate on technological innovation for energy production and consumption. The findings are a concern given that the transition towards a fossil fuel free future will have a greater likelihood of success with public engagement and public acceptance.

Often, however, considerations regarding developing a meaningful partnership with community organisations are not highlighted. Researchers need to identify the most appropriate organisation with which to engage and their capacity to be involved. Researchers tend to involve organisations based on their connection to potential participants, which relationship often ends after achieving this objective. Further, the partner organisation may not have the capacity to contribute meaningfully to the research process. As such, it is the researchers' responsibility to build capacity within their partner organisations to encourage more sustainable and meaningful community-engaged research. Organisations pertinent to immigrant/ethnic-minority communities fall into three sectors: public, private and non-profit. While public and private sectors play an important role in addressing issues among immigrant/ethnic-minority communities, their contribution as research partners may be limited. Involving the non-profit sector, which tends to be more accessible and utilitarian and includes both grassroots associations (GAs) and immigrant service providing organisations (ISPOs), is more likely to result in mutually beneficial research partnerships and enhanced community engagement. GAs tend to be deeply rooted within, and thus are often truly representative of, the community. As they may not fully understand their importance from a researcher's perspective, nor have time for research, capacity-building activities are required to address these limitations. Additionally, ISPOs may have a different understanding of research and research priorities.

Solid waste management (SWM) has become one of the primarily focused areas of such initiatives. The changing dynamics of urban waste characteristics due to unplanned urbanization and rapid growth in urban populations (due to migration) has been a significant concern for local authorities in urban areas to develop an effective SWM plan. The development of a long-term SWM plan along the line of the government initiatives' objectives requires understanding the waste quantities, characteristics, and existing waste management practices. This paper presents an overview of existing waste management activities, financial and institutional demographics in six selected Indian Smart Cities, and the field studies to assess SWM systems as per the waste management rules. The study involved a participatory approach to collect data from local bodies and stakeholders. Indicative strategies for the development of waste management systems were formulated based on the outputs of this analysis.

Researchers have also started to explore the use of social networking media for teaching and learning in higher education. Social networking media have offered new opportunities for sharing, creating and interacting between students and teachers. However, to implement and adopt such technology, there is a need to investigate the factors that influence the acceptance of the students and the teachers using such technologies as a tool for learning and teaching. In this paper, a study based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which emphasizes on Perceived Ease of Use and Perceived Usefulness together with Behavior Intention to use new technologies, is used to test the factors of using social networking media for e-learning in Libyan higher education. A quantitative research method was employed utilizing survey method. Research data was collected from a sample of teachers and students from four universities in the Libyan higher educational sector. Structural Equation Modeling was carried out to examine the predictive behaviour of the proposed factors of the research model. It was discovered from the study that the Perceived Ease of Use and Perceived Usefulness are important factors for predicting a student's and teachers' behavioral intention to use social networking media for e-learning in Libyan higher education.Index Terms-Libyan higher education, social networking media, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, e-learning.
I. INTRODUCTIONThe impact of the Internet on the education sector has taken both teachers' and students' attention in recent years. New generations of Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 have added more enthusiasm and excitement for people to spend many hours on internet based applications, especially social networking media [1]. A big portion of the social networking media users are youths who are mostly university students [2]. Many studies have reported that Facebook is the most common social networking tool used where 85-99% of the university students use it for all aspects of life, including for educational purposes [3]. A recent study of about 3000 college students, from USA, indicated that 90% of students utilize Facebook and 37% of them use Twitter to share information [4].Social networking media (e.g Facebook, Linkedin or Twitter) received a lot of attention due to the high take up rate across the world.

Although flow theory (FLT) is a valid model for understanding behavior, currently the nature of the roles and interplay of FLT constructs within the theory of planned behavior (TPB) framework when attempting to explain the determinants of motivations for intention to speed and speeding behavior of car drivers is not yet known. The study aims to synthesize TPB and FLT in explaining drivers of advanced vehicles intentions to speed and speed violation behaviors and evaluate factors that are critical for explaining intention and behavior. Method: The hypothesized model was validated using a sample collected from 354 fully licensed drivers of advanced vehicles, involving 278 males and 76 females on 2 occasions separated by a 3-month interval. During the first of the 2 occasions, participants completed questionnaire measures of TPB and FLT variables. Three months later, participants' speed violation behaviors were assessed. Results: The study observed a significant positive relationship between the constructs. The proposed model accounted for 51 and 45% of the variance in intention to speed and speed violation behavior, respectively. The independent predictors of intention were enjoyment, attitude, and subjective norm. The independent predictors of speed violation behavior were enjoyment, concentration, intention, and perceived behavioral control. Conclusions: The findings suggest that safety interventions for preventing speed violation behaviors should be aimed at underlying beliefs influencing the speeding behaviors of drivers of advanced vehicles. Furthermore, perceived enjoyment is of equal importance to driver's intention, influencing speed violation behavior.",https://doi.org/10.1080/15389588.2017.1307969,article
"Davis, Fred D.",1989.0,"{Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and user acceptance of information technology","Valid measurement scales for predicting user acceptance of computers are in short supply. Most subjective measures used in practice are unvalidated, and their relationship to system usage is unknown. The present research develops and vandales new scales for two specific variables, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which are hypothesized to be fundamental determinants of user acceptance. Definitions for these two variables were used to develop scale items that were pretested for content validity and then tested for reliability and construct validity in two studies involving a total of 152 users and four application programs. The measures were refined and stream-lined, resulting in two six-item scales with reliabilities of .98 for usefulness and .94 for ease of use. The scales exhibited high convergent, discriminant, and factorial validity. Perceived usefulness was significantly correlated with both self-reported current usage (r=.63, Study 1) and self-predicted future usage (r=.85, Study 2). Perceived ease of use was also significantly correlated with current usage (r=.45, Study 1) and future usage (r=.59, Study 2). In both studies, usefulness had a significantly greater correlation with usage behavior than did ease of use. Regression analyses suggest that perceived ease of use may actually be a causal antecedent to perceived usefulness, as opposed toy a parallel, direct determinant of system usage. Implications are drawn for future research on user acceptance.",https://doi.org/10.2307/249008,article

Using the context of the city of Bloemfontein, South Africa and drawing on the perceptions of stakeholders, the objective of the paper is to offer a perspective on such a transformation. The study first assessed the performance of various factors and attributes that influence three important aspects of a smart city: economy, mobility and governance system. It then recorded the viewpoints of stakeholders about how these aspects can contribute to the development of a smart city. Further, Applied Systems Analysis (ASA) linked System Dynamics (SD) conceptual models based on the interlinkage and causal feedback relationships among various factors under each aspect were developed, which could assist in offering perspectives that would enable eliciting of policy interventions to develop smart cities. Findings indicate that there are potentials and positive indicators in all three aspects. It is emerged that reinforcement of the inter-relationship among entrepreneurship, innovation, productivity, economic image and international embeddedness will foster a smart economy. Efficient public transportation and advancement of Information Communication Technology (ICT) system will strengthen local accessibility and ensure an innovative, sustainable and safe transportation system that will result in smart mobility.

The larger the development, the more likely it will be unsuccessful. Despite the persistence of this problem for decades and the expenditure of vast sums of money, computer failure has received surprisingly little attention in the public administration literature. This article outlines the problems of enthusiasm and the problems of control, as well as the overwhelming complexity, that make the failure of large developments almost inevitable. Rather than the positive view found in much of the public administration literature, the author suggests a pessimism when it comes to information systems development. Aims for information technology should be modest ones, and in many cases, the risks, uncertainties, and probability of failure mean that new investments in technology are not justified. The author argues for a public official as a recalcitrant, suspicious, and skeptical adopter of IT. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1540-6210.2007.00778.X,article

Current assessment of these outcomes relies on self-report which is susceptible to bias. This paper reports on the relationship between loneliness and objective measures of isolation using a phone monitoring device. Method: Phone monitors were installed in the homes of 26 independent elderly individuals from the ORCATECH Life Laboratory cohort (age 86 ± 4.5, 88% female) and used to monitor the daily phone usage for an average of 174 days. Loneliness was assessed using the 20-item University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness scale. A mixed effects negative binomial regression was used to model the relationship between loneliness and social isolation, as assessed using the total number of calls, controlling for cognitive function, pain, age, gender, and weekday. A secondary analysis examined the differential effect of loneliness on incoming and outgoing calls. Results: The average UCLA Loneliness score was 35.3 ± 7.6, and the median daily number of calls was 4. Loneliness was negatively associated with telephone use (IRR = 0.99, p < 0.05). Daily phone use was also associated with gender (IRR = 2.03, p < 0.001) and cognitive status (IRR = 1.51, p < 0.001). The secondary analysis revealed that loneliness was significantly related to incoming (IRR = 0.98, p < 0.01) but not outgoing calls. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the close relationship between loneliness and social isolation, showing that phone behaviour is associated with emotional state and cognitive function. Because phone behaviour can be monitored unobtrusively, it may be possible to sense loneliness levels in older adults using objective assessments of key aspects of behaviour.",https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2015.1060947,article

"Casakin, H. and Hern{\'{a",2015.0,{Place attachment and place identity in Israeli cities: The influence of city size,"A major limitation of most urban and environmental studies dealing with place attachment and place identity is that they are mostly restricted to neighborhood. There is a general assumption that neighborhood is the fundamental category of analysis to study attachment and identity. However, except for a few studies focusing on environments such as dwellings, other spatial scales still need to be explored. This gap exists despite the fact that the intensity of attachment and identity bonds established with place are supposedly affected by the size of the environment. In order to explore differences in the relation between the two bonds and the size of the environment, we carried out a study in neighborhoods and cities. We further investigated possible differences in place attachment and place identity between residents who were born in the city and residents originally from other cities. The sample involved 208 participants (54.8% natives and 45.2% from other cities). Results showed a higher level of attachment and identity to city than to neighborhood. Place attachment was higher in large and small-sized cities than in medium-sized. Place identity, on the other hand, was greater in large rather than in small and medium-sized cities. In addition, a positive correlation was found between the two bonds and the length of residence in the city. However, having been born in the city or not did not affect the intensity of bonds with place. Implications for urban planning are suggested.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.CITIES.2014.07.007,article

Splintering Urbanism. Networked Infractructures, Technoloical Moblilities and the Urban condition. Routledge, London]. Whilst acknowledging the value of the thesis as an analytical framework in opening the way to innovative understandings of contemporary urban dynamics, the paper argues that, taken together, the articles in this themed issue seriously challenge the ""splintering urbanism"" thesis theoretically, empirically and methodologically. They question in particular the postulated universality of the ""modern infrastructural ideal"" and of ""unbundling"" and ""bypass"" processes - all of which are key elements in Graham and Marvin's argument - as well as the assertion that reforms in infrastructure sectors should generally result in more discriminatory, socially regressive patterns of provision of essential services and more splintered urban spaces. Based on these fundamental critiques, the paper concludes that one cannot speak of ""splintering urbanism in general"" - i.e., as a global trend - in any meaningful analytical way. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.GEOFORUM.2008.10.008,article

But it is not at all clear what these arrangements will mean for cities that have spent the past decade building an ‘innovation complex' around physical density, digital technology and real estate development. On the one hand, many parts of the tech ecosystem that relied on face-to-face interaction – such as coworking spaces, hackathons and venture capitalists' mentoring of start-up founders – have already moved online. On the other hand, cutting tech ecosystems loose from place-based offices, labour markets and institutional networks puts cities' economic future at risk. This could drastically weaken the value of the city's fixed capital of buildings and land, its social capital of institutional networks and communities, and its human capital of workers with tech skills. Yet partnering with tech leaders to ‘reimagine' the city could advance the power of Big Tech.

The BESS planning is more critical where only selected cost parameters were considered, and the sustainability aspects were ignored in most cases. In this paper, BESS planning is re-imagined from a circular economy perspective that primarily allows the optimal use of battery capacities without compromising the grid support. A novel method for optimal siting and sizing of commercially available residential BESS for ancillary support in low voltage residential feeders is proposed. This method incorporates the cost of BESS operation in the planning stages to provide an accurate estimate of BESS for grid support. The implications of introducing BESS operation cost at the planning stages are demonstrated by solving four different optimization problems with the costs defined as over-voltage, voltage fluctuations, BESS costs (investment, O&M costs), and multiple objective operations. To validate, the proposed method is applied to an IEEE European low voltage feeder and a modified version of this test feeder to an Australian scenario using particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. It is found that the proposed method successfully reduces the BESS costs and provides an appropriate estimation of how the BESS installations can provide grid voltage support. Compared to the existing methodologies for mitigating over-voltage, the net required BESS capacity for the European and Australian feeders was reduced by 7.21 percent and 9.58 percent, respectively. The total BESS capacity in the European and Australian grids was decreased by 41.48 percent and 48.06 percent, simultaneously compared with the methodologies for reducing the voltage fluctuations. Overall, the optimal sizing and siting approach we proposed not only reduces the voltage fluctuations and required battery capacities but also promotes circular economy by lowering the resources in the BESS planing for ancillary services.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2022.10.101,article

Authors argue that organized networks of citizens (such as non-profit organizations or private associations) together with networks of institutions (such as partnerships amongst municipalities or universities) are needed in order to improve the smartness of a city; technologies are framed as opportunities and supports for more inclusive and informed decision-making processes, i.e. as a tool, rather than as a goal, for effective smartness. The paper discusses the primary findings of a Research Project conducted at the Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering (DICEA), University of Naples, titled ""Smart Energy Master for the Energy Management of Territory"" funded by EU.The methodology is based on the case-study method, whose sources of evidence are: quantitative indicators, archival documents, and excerpts from interviews with key stakeholders. In detail, the paper focuses on three Southern Italian cities (Reggio Calabria, Catania and Palermo), which have been clustered for similar challenges they have to face, in relation to their geographical proximity and cultural features. Findings show the twofold use of technologies for cities: on the one hand, technology may be perceived as a panacea and Smart initiatives may be isolated and episodic experiments; on the other, technologies may be critically incorporated in complex policies and initiatives aimed at regenerating urban areas holistically, and Smart initiatives may be coordinated and well-connected experiences.

"Levine, Nathaniel M. and Spencer, Billie F.",2022.0,{Post-Earthquake Building Evaluation Using UAVs: A BIM-Based Digital Twin Framework,"Computer vision has shown potential for assisting post-earthquake inspection of buildings through automatic damage detection in images. However, assessing the safety of an earthquake-damaged building requires considering this damage in the context of its global impact on the structural system. Thus, an inspection must consider the expected damage progression of the associated component and the component's contribution to structural system performance. To address this issue, a digital twin framework is proposed for post-earthquake building evaluation that integrates unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery, component identification, and damage evaluation using a Building Information Model (BIM) as a reference platform. The BIM guides selection of optimal sets of images for each building component. Then, if damage is identified, each image pixel is assigned to a specific BIM component, using a GrabCut-based segmentation method. In addition, 3D point cloud change detection is employed to identify nonstructural damage and associate that damage with specific BIM components. Two example applications are presented. The first develops a digital twin for an existing reinforced concrete moment frame building and demonstrates BIM-guided image selection and component identification. The second uses a synthetic graphics environment to demonstrate 3D point cloud change detection for identifying damaged nonstructural masonry walls. In both examples, observed damage is tied to BIM components, enabling damage to be considered in the context of each component's known design and expected earthquake performance. The goal of this framework is to combine component-wise damage estimates with a pre-earthquake structural analysis of the building to predict a building's post-earthquake safety based on an external UAV survey.",https://doi.org/10.3390/S22030873,article

Recent in situ and laboratory observations indicate that cidaroid sea urchins feed on live stalked crinoids, leaving distinct bite marks on their skeletal elements. Similar bite marks on fossil crinoids from Poland strongly suggest that these animals have been subject to echinoid predation since the Triassic. Following their near-demise during the end-Permian extinction, crinoids underwent a major evolutionary radiation during the Middle-Late Triassic that produced distinct morphological and behavioral novelties, particularly motile taxa that contrasted strongly with the predominantly sessile Paleozoic crinoid faunas. We suggest that the appearance and subsequent evolutionary success of motile crinoids were related to benthic predation by post-Paleozoic echinoids with their stronger and more active feeding apparatus and that, in the case of crinoids, the predation-driven Mesozoic marine revolution started earlier than in other groups, perhaps soon after the end-Permian extinction.",https://doi.org/10.1073/PNAS.0914199107,article
"Zhu, Kevin and Kraemer, Kenneth L.",2005.0,{Post-adoption variations in usage and value of e-business by organizations: Cross-country evidence from the retail industry,"Grounded in the innovation diffusion literature and the resource-based theory, this paper develops an integrative research model for assessing the diffusion and consequence of e-business at the firm level. Unlike the typical focus on adoption as found in the literature, we focus on postadoption stages, that is, actual usage and value creation. The model thus moves beyond dichotomous ""adoption versus nonadoption"" and accounts for the ""missing link"" - actual usage - as a critical stage of value creation. The model links technological, organizational, and environmental factors to e-business use and value, based on which a series of hypotheses are developed. The theoretical model is tested by using structural equation modeling on a dataset of 624 firms across 10 countries in the retail industry. To probe deeper into whether e-business use and value are influenced by economic environments, two subsamples from developed and developing countries are compared. The study finds that technology competence, firm size, financial commitment, competitive pressure, and regulatory support are important antecedents of e-business use. In addition, the study finds that, while both front-end and back-end capabilities contribute to e-business value, back-end integration has a much stronger impact. While front-end functionalities are becoming commodities, e-businesses are more differentiated by back-end integration. This is consistent with the resource-based theory because back-end integration possesses the value-creating characteristics of resources (e.g., firm specific, difficult to imitate), which are strengthened by the Internet-enabled connectivity. Our study also adds an international dimension to the innovation diffusion literature, showing that careful attention must be paid to the economic and regulatory factors that may affect technology diffusion across different countries. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1287/ISRE.1050.0045,article

Design/methodology/approach In total, 487 students participated in this study. A seven-likert scale survey questionnaire which comprised of 23 items was completed by the students. Structural equation modeling was used as the statistical technique to analyze the data. Findings The study found that the resulting model was fairly able to predict and explain behavioral intention (BI) among students in Ghana. In addition, this study found that attitudes toward use and subjective norm significantly influenced students' BI to use mobile learning. The model explained 23.0 percent of the variance in BI, 33.8 percent in perceived usefulness and 47.6 percent in attitudes toward use. Of all the three endogenous variables, attitude had the greatest effect on BI. Originality/value Although, the above-mentioned models have been adopted in many studies, few or none have combined TRA and TAM as a research framework to predict and explain students' intention to use m-learning since m-learning is fairly new in educational environments. Therefore, a model that combines all constructs from TRA and TAM was proposed in this study to explore university students' intention to use m-learning in schools.",https://doi.org/10.1108/JRIT-03-2017-0004,article

Due to the inadequate capacity of Routine Health Information Systems (RHIS), many developing countries face a lack of quality pre-disaster health-related data and efficient post-disaster data processes in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. Considering the significance of local capacity during the early stages of disaster response, RHIS at local, provincial/state and national levels need to be strengthened so that they provide relief personnel up-to-date information to plan, organize and monitor immediate relief activities. RHIS professionals should be aware of specific information needs in disaster response (according to the Sphere Project's Humanitarian Minimum Standards) and requirements in data processes to fulfil those information needs. Preparing RHIS for disasters can be guided by key RHIS-strengthening frameworks; and disaster preparedness must be incorporated into countries' RHIS.

Objective: This study aims to explore the prevalence, patterns, and predictors of the use of the internet, digital devices, and apps for health purposes as well as preferences for future use of eHealth support in South Asian Canadians. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional, mixed-mode survey in a convenience sample of 831 South Asian adults recruited at faith-based gathering places, health care settings, and community events in Edmonton, Alberta, in 2014. The 706 responders (mean age 47.1, SD 17.6 years; n=356, 50.4% female; n=509, 72.1% Sikh) who provided complete sociodemographic information were included in the analysis, and the denominators varied based on the completeness of responses to each question. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine sociodemographic and health status predictors of internet use, being a web-based health information seeker, smartphone or tablet ownership, health app use, and willingness to use various modes of eHealth support. Results: Of all respondents, 74.6% (527/706) were internet users and 47.8% (336/703) were web-based health information seekers. In addition, 74.9% (527/704) of respondents owned a smartphone or tablet and 30.7% (159/518) of these had a health and fitness app. Most internet users (441/527, 83.7%) expressed interest in using ≥1 mode of eHealth support. Older age, being female, having less than high school education, preferring written health information in languages other than English, and lacking confidence in completing medical forms predicted lack of internet use. Among internet users, factors that predicted web-based health information seeking were being female, use of the internet several times per day, being confident in completing medical forms, and preferring health information in English. Predictors of not owning a smartphone or tablet were being older, preferring health information in languages other than English, having less than high school education, living in Canada for <5 years, having a chronic health condition, and having diabetes. Increasing age was associated with lower odds of having a health app. Preferring health information in languages other than English consistently predicted lower interest in all modes of eHealth support. Conclusions: eHealth-based chronic disease prevention and management interventions are feasible for South Asian adults, but digital divides exist according to language preference, education, age, sex, confidence in completing medical forms, and number of years lived in Canada. Community-based, culturally tailored strategies targeting these factors are required to address existing divides and increase the uptake of credible web-based and app-based resources for health purposes.",https://doi.org/10.2196/20671,article

Still, habits are not included in most narratives, theories, and interventions applied to sustainable behaviour. One reason societies struggle to reach policy goals and people fail to change towards more pro-environmental lifestyles might be that many behaviours are now bound by strong habits that override knowledge and intentions to act. In this perspective article, we provide three arguments for why pro-environmental habits are a needed research agenda in sustainability science: (1) habit theory highlights how behaviour is heavily reliant on automatic processes, (2) the environmental context sets boundary conditions for behaviour, shape habits, and cues action responses, and (3) our habits and past behaviour shape our values and self-identity. These arguments highlight the transformative potential of looking at sustainable behaviours through a habit lens. We believe a research agenda on pro-environmental habits could generate a more holistic understanding of sustainable behaviours and complement today's dominating approaches which emphasize reasoned decisions and intrinsic motivations such as values, norms, and intentions to understand and predict pro-environmental behaviour. We highlight evident knowledge gaps and practical benefits of considering habit theory to promote pro-environmental behaviours, and how habit architecture could be utilized as a strong leverage point when designing, modifying, and building urban environments.",https://doi.org/10.1007/S13280-021-01619-6,article

"Adiotomre, K and Ukrakpor, E & F",2015.0,{Production of Biogas From Kitchen Waste and Cow Dung,"Biogas is a mixture of colorless, flammable gases obtained by the anaerobic digestion of organic waste materials. It is an alternative source of energy. The major composition of biogas is methane (CH 4) 50-70%. It can be used for cooking and power generation, while the residues from the process are used as fertilizers. In this experimental work, an equal ratio of 2.5kg kitchen waste and 2.5kg water with small amount (1.75kg) of cow dung was weighted. The 1.75kg of cow dung was mixed with 1.5kg of water fed into 13.5 liter constructed digester and after some days, 2.5kg kitchen waste was mixed with 1kg of water and also fed into the digester. Then allowed to ferment for period of 22 days and a pressure range of 0psi-70.5psi was obtained. A graph of pressure (psi) against time (hrs), volume (liters) against time (hrs) and Pressure (psi) against volume (liters) of gas shows increase in pressure (psi) with time (hrs) and an increase in pressure with decrease in volume. A combustion test was also carried out which showed that for every 1 minute the temperature of water increases. The result from analysis of biogas composition done revealed the following: CH 4 (67.58%), H 2 (5.16%), CO 2 (20.29%), N 2 (8.46%), O 2 (1.06%) and H 2 S (2.36%) which has proved that really kitchen waste is a good raw material for production of biogas. INTRODUCTION Fossil fuel provides the bulk of the world's primary source of energy. Since they are non-renewable natural resources with little to conserve the earth's supply, supplies of fossil fuel (especially oil and gas) may soon get completely depleted. Additionally, the rising cost of petroleum and allied products most especially in Nigeria has triggered a need to develop alternate sources of energy, one of which is biogas production. In Nigeria, majority of the population are rural dwellers without access to gas or electricity and therefore depend on firewood for cooking and lightening. Unfortunately, this has contributed immensely to the rapid rate of deforestation and desert encroachment. The establishment of biogas plants in these communities would greatly ameliorate these problems and help preserve the environment. Biogas is distinct from other renewable energy source such as solar energy, wind energy, thermal and hydro sources of energy because of its characteristics of using controlling and collecting organic waste and at the same time producing fertilizer and water for use in agricultural irrigation. Anaerobic digestion process produces a higher biogas yield when running on a mixture of animal manure and vegetable/crop waste rather than animal manure alone, and biogas production is considered the most suitable bio energy technology in china (Wu CZ et al 2009). The slurry and residues from the biogas process can also be used as an organic fertilizer to replace the use of chemical fertilizer on the farm (HUGO 2008; Zhou Cx et al 2004; Liu y et al 2008 and chem. RJ 2007). The composition of biogas is typically methane (50-70%), carbon-dioxide (30-40%) and the rest is made up of traces of elements of hydrogen sulphide. Biogas can be used in gas engine to convert the energy in the gas into electricity and heat. Biogas is characterized based on its chemical composition and the physical characteristics which result from it. It is primarily a mixture of methane (CH 4) and inert carbonic gas (CO 2). However the name 'biogas' gathers a large variety of gases resulting from specific treatment processes, starting from various organic waste-industries, animals or domestic organic waste etc.",https://doi.org/10.19080/IJESNR.2017.05.555653.,article

Participants included preschool, primary, and secondary teachers from Trans Nzoia County. Data sources were pre- and post-surveys, participant-generated artifacts, and interviews. Our participants perceived the following needs: new literacies for learners, creativity for learners, collaboration and group work, and creativity to overcome technological challenges. Overall, participants embraced learner-centered teaching theoretically but found that the lack of technological resources created barriers to teaching digital literacy in a learner-centered fashion. We found that teachers reported mostly using technology for teaching preparation and record keeping rather than engaging students in digital literacy practices. To solve technological challenges, teachers described having students work in groups and using smartphones.

Long-term evaluation of a carbon calculator interview,"The UK needs to accelerate action to achieve its 80 per cent carbon reduction target by 2050 as it is otherwise in danger of lagging behind. A much discussed question in this context is whether voluntary behaviour change initiatives can make a significant contribution to reaching this target. While providing individuals with general information on climate change or low carbon action is increasingly seen as ineffective, some studies argue that personalised information has greater potential to encourage behaviour change. This mixed methods study examines this claim through a longitudinal field experiment which tested the effectiveness of a carbon calculator interview. It finds that the intervention significantly raised awareness of ways in which participants could reduce their carbon footprint. However, this increased awareness did not translate into measurable behaviour changes in relation to home energy and travel. Qualitative analysis shows that participants refer to infrastructural, social and psychological barriers to change. This indicates that more ambitious government and corporate action is required to speed up carbon reduction.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2018.05.030,article

With a high chronic and noncommunicable disease (NCD) and HIV burden in both settings, it is not uncommon to find patients having this double burden of disease. Additionally, patient resiliency is exacerbated by the multiplication of both demands made by the interactions from treatment modalities and multiple service providers. The Cumulative Complexity Model (CCM) posits that as the burden of disease and resulting workload increase, the patient capacity to respond to it diminishes. In middle and high-income countries, a dedicated system of care for people living with HIV/AIDS was developed in parallel to existing systems of care for NCDs, which has been successful in increasing advocacy, political will, and healthcare worker empowerment. We explore the application of this model across settings, along with other potential solutions.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-77685-9_5,article
"Chang, I. Chun Catherine and Jou, Sue Ching and Chung, Ming Kuang",2021.0,{Provincialising smart urbanism in Taipei: The smart city as a strategy for urban regime transition,"The appeal of revolutionising urban governance through information technologies has prompted cities across the globe to pursue smart city initiatives. The mainstream scholarship on these initiatives has mostly focused on technology and corporate-led urban development, and it also often privileges the experience of cities in the global North. Nevertheless, this mainstream understanding of the smart city may obscure emerging new power dynamics and locally contextualised processes associated with smart urban development, especially in cities at the global periphery. Inspired by post-colonial theories, this article makes the case for ‘provincialising' smart urbanism by dislodging technology from the centre of analysis, accentuating perspectives of cities outside the locations where the smart city knowledge is traditionally produced and attending to power relationships. In our case study of Taipei, this provincialising approach helps unveil various logics, intentionalities, assemblages and power dynamics through which the smart city is employed as a political strategy to facilitate urban regime transition. We argue that the current non-affiliated Ko administration exploits the veneer of technological superiority and political neutrality of its smart city agenda to set a new growth agenda, form new development coalitions, establish new institutions and incorporate rising populist momentum into policy-making. Focusing on the politics of being smart, our findings illustrate how smart city experiments reshape power dynamics and regime formation through reorganising actors and interest groups, reconfiguring government institutions, reallocating resource distribution and, in the end, bolstering governing legitimacy.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0042098020947908,article

However, existing research has shown that introducing user participation into public e-service development can be challenging. In this study, we interviewed citizens in order to explore their willingness and ability to participate in public e-service development according to three user participation schools: User-Centred Design, Participatory Design and User Innovation. Our findings show that citizens in general are willing to participate, but their ability to do so is limited. Based on our findings, we developed nine propositions to explain citizens' willingness and ability to participate in public e-service development. The propositions contribute to practice by acting as a tentative guide for systems developers when they use user participation schools as inspiration in public e-service projects.

It assesses how public trust influences e-governance performance through the lens of good governance principles, encompassing evaluations of trust in government services and trust in the technological infrastructure used for citizen services. Design/methodology/approach: The research framework is based on a thorough literature review, pilot study and practical experience. An empirical survey was conducted using a structured questionnaire to collect primary data from individuals who have used specific e-governance projects. To conduct the survey, the author used the snowball sampling method both offline and online. The author analysed the data using SmartPLS Version 3 to assess the measurement and structural model. Findings: The study rigorously examines and confirms all formulated hypotheses using robust statistical analyses. Nonetheless, the results underscore the pivotal significance of the reliability and utility of e-governance services in nurturing public trust. Furthermore, the research unveils a troubling concern pertaining to the absence of tailored responses to citizen inquiries, grievances and recommendations, indicating an area of vulnerability in the effort to cultivate public trust. Research limitations/implications: The research has implications for managers, citizens and researchers. It focuses on public trust in interaction-based collaboration, but researchers may extend it to other forms like content-based collaboration. Policymakers can implement the findings in present and future e-governance projects. Limitations include a moderate sample size, country context, and not assessing other factors that may influence public trust in collaborative e-governance performance. Originality/value: This study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by exploring the link between good governance, public trust and collaborative e-governance performance. It focuses on projects that require physical visits to government offices, where public trust has been impacted. This study is unique because it assesses public trust in collaborative e-governance, specifically in the context of India, where there is limited prior research on this topic exists.",https://doi.org/10.1108/TG-08-2023-0113,article

The paradigms of traditional public administration and new public management sit uncomfortably with networked governance. In contrast, it is argued the public value management paradigm bases its practice in the systems of dialogue and exchange that characterize networked governance. Ultimately, the strength of public value management is seen to rest on its ability to point to a motivational force that does not solely rely on rules or incentives to drive public service practice and reform. People are, it suggests, motivated by their involvement in networks and partnerships, that is, their relationships with others formed in the context of mutual respect and shared learning. Building successful relationships is the key to networked governance and the core objective of the management needed to support it. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1177/0275074005282583,article

Increasing constraints on the public sector in many societies, combined with increasing demand for individual engagement and the affordances of digital technology, have paved the way for participatory innovations aimed at effective governance. Deepening legitimation deficits of representative government create opportunities for legitimacy-enhancing forms of citizen participation, but so far, the effect of participation on legitimacy is unclear.

This research proposes a methodology to quantify disaster impacts more equitably by integrating the three pillars of sustainability: environmental (hazard and asset damage), economic (macro-economic changes in production and employment) and social (disaster recovery at the household level). The model innovates by assessing the impacts of disasters on people's consumption, considering asset losses and changes in income, among other factors. We apply the model to a hypothetical earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area, considering the differential impact of consumption loss on households of varying wealth. The analysis reveals that poorer households suffer 19% of the asset losses but 41% of the well-being losses.

To avoid selecting an untrusted jammer, we aim to design two quantitative models from the perspective of time and space to evaluate the trustworthiness of IoT-Ds. Firstly, we adopt an improved energy detector to better counter signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) fluctuation of AN detection. Secondly, based on the detection results, we adopt two trust models: (1) the spatial-oriented beta trust model, (2) the time-oriented hidden Markov model (HMM)-based trust model. In the first model, direct and indirect trust of an IoT-D are both calculated to obtain an integrated trust value. In the second model, the probability of trusted state is calculated as the trust value, and time intervals between detection results of an IoT-D are taken into consideration. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the performance of our improved energy detection method and two trust models.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.ADHOC.2022.102994,article

Despite smart specialisation and heterogeneity on national and global markets, they are often in pursuit of the highest possible socio-economic outcome so as to outperform their peers in this dynamic region. The present study seeks to present an operational comparative framework for judging the complex performance of several (12) large urban agglomerations in Asia. In the framework of this paper, these cities are called ‘stellar cities'. Two particular research challenges are addressed: (i) the development and application of a new Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) approach, culminating—after a cascade of sequential analytical steps—in an Autoconfiguration Target Model which serves as a quantitative statistical tool for evaluating the (relative) multidimensional goal-oriented performance of the cities concerned; and (ii) a new functional interpretation of the DEA slack space for the possible improvement of inefficiently operating cities on the basis of Amartya Sen's capability theory. In the paper, we use an extensive database on 12 Asian stellar cities, extracted from the annual Global Power City Index (GPCI) system which contains more than 60 urban performance indicators, which has been constructed by the Institute of Urban Strategies (Tokyo). We find that the performance ranking of these Asian mega-cities shows the ‘winners', but also a high variability, with several positive and negative outliers. We conclude that there is clearly scope (‘capability') for further improvement of the efficiency of most Asian cities in various specific policy domains, as shown by the DEA results.",https://doi.org/10.1007/S00168-021-01106-6,article

"Sadowski, Sebastian and Spachos, Petros",2018.0,{RSSI-Based Indoor Localization with the Internet of Things,"In the era of smart cities, there are a plethora of applications where the localization of indoor environments is important, from monitoring and tracking in smart buildings to proximity marketing and advertising in shopping malls. The success of these applications is based on the development of a cost-efficient and robust real-time system capable of accurately localizing objects. In most outdoor localization systems, global positioning system (GPS) is used due to its ease of implementation and accuracy up to five meters. However, due to the limited space that comes with performing localization of indoor environments and the large number of obstacles found indoors, GPS is not a suitable option. Hence, accurately and efficiently locating objects is a major challenge in indoor environments. Recent advancements in the Internet of Things (IoT) along with novel wireless technologies can alleviate the problem. Small-size and cost-efficient IoT devices which use wireless protocols can provide an attractive solution. In this paper, we compare four wireless technologies for indoor localization: Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11n-2009 at the 2.4 GHz band), Bluetooth low energy, Zigbee, and long-range wide-area network. These technologies are compared in terms of localization accuracy and power consumption when IoT devices are used. The received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values from each modality were used and trilateration was performed for localization. The RSSI data set is available online. The experimental results can be used as an indicator in the selection of a wireless technology for an indoor localization system following application requirements.",https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2843325,article

An iterative and pragmatic approach to working with large and disparate datasets of different formats and types resulted in improved application runtime and efficiency, which is important to consider in real time decision-making processes during hurricanes and similar catastrophic events. This technology was developed initially for Puerto Rico, following extreme hurricane and earthquake events in 2017 and 2020, but is applicable to utilities around the world.

Through a study of seven UK smart cities, the paper investigates the framing of city problems, selection of smart verticals, and decision-making logics. The findings highlight that the selection of smart city verticals within the case study cities is rooted in four key considerations: challenges in service delivery, pragmatism, entrepreneurialism, and broader national and global events and policy agendas.

For example, automated camera traps are widely used for ecosystem monitoring but it is challenging to transmit images for real-time analysis where there is no reliable cellular or WiFi connectivity. We modified an off-the-shelf camera trap (Bushnell™) and customised existing open-source hardware to create a ‘smart' camera trap system. Images captured by the camera trap are instantly labelled by an artificial intelligence model and an ‘alert' containing the image label and other metadata is then delivered to the end-user within minutes over the Iridium satellite network. We present results from testing in the Netherlands, Europe, and from a pilot test in a closed-canopy forest in Gabon, Central Africa. All reference materials required to build the system are provided in open-source repositories. Results show the system can operate for a minimum of 3 months without intervention when capturing a median of 17.23 images per day. The median time-difference between image capture and receiving an alert was 7.35 min, though some outliers showed delays of 5-days or more when the system was incorrectly positioned and unable to connect to the Iridium network.

Reliable object detection and tracking is an important research issue in various WSN applications, such as environment and disaster monitoring, disaster propagation tracking, and intruder monitoring and tracking. Generally, because batteries are used as energy sources for sensors in WSNs, a highly energy-efficient operation is needed to prolong the life of the sensors and networks. To save energy, sensors usually manage multi-mode sensing operations, in which they periodically switch between active and inactive periods. A tradeoff exists between object detection accuracy and energy efficiency when we select a sensing schedule. Depending on the object speed, direction, and sensor deployment topology, different sensing schedules should be dynamically applied to individual sensors. In this paper, we propose a novel recurrent neural network (RNN)-based dynamic duty cycle control method for sensor nodes. For RNN training, a target optimal duty cycle for a given network condition is derived from the proposed digital twin-space analytic solution.

The Joint UK Land Environment Simulator - INteractive Fire and Emissions algorithm for Natural envirOnments (JULES-INFERNO) is a global land surface model, which simulates vegetation, soils, and fire occurrence driven by environmental factors. However, this model incurs substantial computational costs due to the high data dimensionality and the complexity of differential equations. Deep-learning-based digital twins have an advantage in handling large amounts of data. They can reduce the computational cost of subsequent predictive models by extracting data features through reduced-order modelling (ROM) and then compressing the data to a low-dimensional latent space. This study proposes a JULES-INFERNO-based digital twin fire model using ROM techniques and deep learning prediction networks to improve the efficiency of global wildfire predictions. The iterative prediction implemented in the proposed model can use current-year data to predict fires in subsequent years. To avoid the accumulation of errors from the iterative prediction, latent data assimilation (LA) is applied to the prediction process. LA manages to efficiently adjust the prediction results to ensure the stability and sustainability of the prediction. Numerical results show that the proposed model can effectively encode the original data and achieve accurate surrogate predictions. Furthermore, the application of LA can also effectively adjust the bias of the prediction results. The proposed digital twin also runs 500 times faster for online predictions than the original JULES-INFERNO model without requiring high-performance computing (HPC) clusters.",https://doi.org/10.5194/NHESS-23-1755-2023,article

Both theory and practice are dominated by ambivalence about the idea of participation itself. Both struggle with dilemmas that make the problems seem insoluble, such as the conflict between the individual and collective interest or between the ideal of democracy and the reality that many voices are never heard. Cases are used to draw on an emerging set of practices of collaborative public engagement from around the world to demonstrate how alternative methods can better meet public participation goals and how they make moot most of the dilemmas of more conventional practice. Research shows that collaborative participation can solve complex, contentious problems such as budget decision making and create an improved climate for future action when bitter disputes divide a community. Authentic dialogue, networks and institutional capacity are the key elements.

As a result, Disaster Risk Management (DRM) and reduction have been gaining increasing importance for urban areas. Remote sensing plays a key role in providing information for urban DRM analysis due to its agile data acquisition, synoptic perspective, growing range of data types, and instrument sophistication, as well as low cost. As a consequence numerous methods have been developed to extract information for various phases of DRM analysis. However, given the diverse information needs, only few of the parameters of interest are extracted directly, while the majority have to be elicited indirectly using proxies. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the proxies developed for two risk elements typically associated with pre-disaster situations (vulnerability and resilience), and two post-disaster elements (damage and recovery), while focusing on urban DRM. The proxies were reviewed in the context of four main environments and their corresponding sub-categories: built-up (buildings, transport, and others), economic (macro, regional and urban economics, and logistics), social (services and infrastructures, and socio-economic status), and natural. All environments and the corresponding proxies are discussed and analyzed in terms of their reliability and sufficiency in comprehensively addressing the selected DRM assessments. We highlight strength and identify gaps and limitations in current proxies, including inconsistencies in terminology for indirect measurements. We present a systematic overview for each group of the reviewed proxies that could simplify cross-fertilization across different DRM domains and may assist the further development of methods. While systemizing examples from the wider remote sensing domain and insights from social and economic sciences, we suggest a direction for developing new proxies, also potentially suitable for capturing functional recovery.",https://doi.org/10.3390/RS10111760,article

It argues that trust is a moderator to influence the relationship between attitude, subjective norm and individual's behavioral intention in smart cities. This study tests hypotheses using a sample of 103 respondents from six smart cities in China. The results reveal that attitude is main factor influencing individual's behavioral intention. Subjective norm and trust are both not statistically significant at the 95% confidence interval in the model of multiple-regression. Interestingly, it finds that trust moderates the relationship between subjective norm and individual's behavioral intention. It means that the audiologists' advice can positively affect person's behavioral intention in smart cities. The findings imply that the Theory of Reasoned Action can be partially used to explain the person's behavioral intention in Chinese context. This study contributes to encourage old people to use smart hospitals to consult audiologists about hearing loss and hearing aids rehabilitation.

As intelligent technology has injected new vitality into emergency management, applying intelligent technology to optimize emergency resource allocation (ERA) has become a focus of research in the post-epidemic era. Based on China's experience in preventing and controlling COVID-19, this paper first analyzes the characteristics and process of ERA in public health emergencies, and then synthesizes the relevant Chinese studies in recent years to identify the intelligent technologies affecting ERA in China using word frequency analysis technology. We also construct an intelligent emergency resource allocation mechanism in four areas: medical intelligence, management intelligence, decision-making intelligence, and supervision intelligence. Finally, we use the entropy-TOPSIS method to evaluate the impact of intelligent technologies on ERA, and we rank the criticality of intelligent technologies.

Nowadays, there are many population groups that would be regarded as vulnerable. In daily life, citizens deal with a wide range of issues—social injustices, social marginalization and lack of impartiality—due to many reasons: culture, class, ethnicity, race, ideology, religion, gender, etc. To respond effectively to this problem—as the United Nations proposes in the goal 10 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)—we first need to understand and clearly define the phenomenon of vulnerable people, and how digital inclusion could represent an asset to help vulnerable people to bridge inequalities. There is no commonly agreed typology framework, and specific categorization criteria as a basis to assist the further investigation of the area. Our work is focused on filling this gap. In doing so, our contribution is twofold. First, we conduct a systematic review of the literature (N = 331 studies) providing an overview of the overall definitions, trends, patterns, and developments that characterize the research on vulnerable people and digital inclusion. Second, we propose a taxonomy to frame the phenomenon of vulnerable people and digital inclusion.

"Duncombe, Richard",2011.0,"{Researching impact of mobile phones for development: Concepts, methods and lessons for practice","The use of mobile phones is an increasingly important part of development efforts particularly in low income countries. Investment in mobiles for development (m-development) is being led by the mobile phone industry together with donors and development partners across a wide range of development sectors. As adoption of mobile phones increases it becomes important to research and understand their impact, and to assess to what extent the expansion of m-development is assisting broader development efforts. This paper provides guidance for conducting research on impact assessment for m-development by reviewing 18 published impact studies, and suggests four key building blocks for good practice in impact assessment. These building blocks encompass: the extent to which the studies address the needs of defined audiences or beneficiaries, the choice of types of impact to assess and units of assessment, the application of suitable conceptual frameworks, and the rigor of the methodology followed. The findings suggest that m-development impact assessment to date falls into three main categories: purely quantitative approaches rooted in information economics, and purely qualitative approaches rooted in social impact assessment. A further mixed method category provides cost effective and timely findings, but with the result of diluting the rigor evident at the methodological poles. Overall, the paper concludes there is a need for more and better guidance for the conduct of such studies, in relation to identifying the rationale and objectives, and linking the choice of concepts and methods with the requirements of key audiences and beneficiaries. The paper identifies m-development impact research as a contested area, and by taking stock of experience thus far, seeks to raise the level of debate concerning the relative merit of alternative methodological and conceptual approaches. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1080/02681102.2011.561279,article

"Molamohamadi, Zohreh and {Asad Samani",2024.0,{Reviewing the historical milestones of risk management,"Risk management is a relatively recent discipline that advocates for the adoption of a risk-based approach in directing and controlling organizations. The ISO Guide 31073:2022, which provides standardized risk management vocabulary and terminology, defines it as a managerial tool that facilitates the direction and control of an organization with regard to risk. Risk management focuses on establishing strategies, policies, and procedures that enable organizations to achieve their objectives while safeguarding and protecting their assets. This leads to the preservation of the value of an organization's critical resources and involves identifying, analyzing, evaluating, and responding appropriately to risk factors, which are inevitable in business life. Effective risk management should not be conducted in isolation or silos, but rather through an enterprise risk management (ERM) approach. ERM is a proactive attempt to manage uncertainties about future outcomes to protect and create value for organizations. Although several studies have examined the historical evolution of risk management, they have primarily focused on specific areas of application, such as financial risk management, supply chain risk management, or project risk management. As a result, there is a lack of comprehensive historical reviews that represent the evolution of risk management as a general concept. The present research aims to fill this literature gap by demonstrating the major milestones in the progression of risk management. This will not only provide a snapshot of risk management development but also an understanding of its significance as a modern discipline that contributes to organizational success. Therefore, this paper does not intend to thoroughly review the risk management literature but rather attempts to historically review the main breakthroughs in this significant field to represent the chronological evolution of risk management.",https://doi.org/10.1007/S43546-024-00762-Y,article

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force, providing unparalleled capabilities for environmental monitoring and conservation. This research paper explores the applications of AI in ecosystem management, including wildlife tracking, habitat assessment, biodiversity analysis, and natural disaster prediction. AI's role in environmental monitoring and conservation includes wildlife tracking, habitat assessment, resource conservation, biodiversity analysis, and species identification. AI algorithms analyze camera trap footage, drone imagery, and GPS data to identify and estimate population sizes, leading to improved anti-poaching efforts and enhanced protection of diverse species. Habitat assessment and resource conservation involve AI-powered image analysis, which aids in assessing forest health, detecting deforestation, and identifying areas in need of restoration. Biodiversity analysis and species identification are achieved through AI algorithms that analyze acoustic recordings, environmental DNA (eDNA), and camera trap footage. These innovations identify different species, assess biodiversity levels, and even discover new or endangered species. AI-powered flood prediction systems provide early warnings, empowering communities with better preparedness and evacuation efforts. Challenges, such as data quality and availability, algorithmic bias, and infrastructure limitations, are acknowledged as opportunities for growth and improvement. In policy and regulation, the paper advocates for clear frameworks prioritizing data privacy and security, algorithmic transparency, and equitable access. Responsible development and ethical use of AI are emphasized as foundational pillars, ensuring that the integration of AI into environmental conservation aligns with principles of fairness, transparency, and societal benefit.",https://doi.org/10.30574/WJARR.2024.21.1.2720,article

The study not only revisits the digital divide in the Canadian context, but also expands current investigations by including an analysis of how demographic factors affect social networking site (SNS) adoption. The findings demonstrate that access to the internet reflects existing inequalities in society with income, education, rural/urban, immigration status, and age all affecting adoption patterns. Furthermore, the results show that inequality in access to the internet is now being mimicked in the level of online activity of internet users. More recent immigrants to Canada have lower rates of internet access; however, recent immigrants who are online have significantly higher levels of online activity than Canadian born residents and earlier immigrants. Additionally, women perform fewer activities online than men. People's use of SNSs differs in terms of education, gender, and age. Women were significantly more likely to use SNSs than men. Interestingly, high school graduates had the lowest percentage of adoption compared to all other education categories. Current students were by far the group that utilized SNSs the most. Canadian born, recent, and early immigrants all showed similar adoption rates of SNSs. Age is a strong predictor of SNS usage, with young people relying heavily on SNSs in comparison to those aged 55+. The findings demonstrate that the digital divide not only persists, but has expanded to include inequality in the level of online activity and SNS usage. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2014.891633,article

Based on these, a framework is developed as a tool to map alternative approaches to making local governance more effective and accountable. At present, there are two schools of thought: one focusing on supply-led or state-led mechanisms such as public expenditure tracking surveys, and the other focusing on a human rights-based approach with RTI law at its centre. The framework developed here suggests that these alternative approaches need not be considered mutually exclusive approaches but can be seen in terms of Dreze and Sen's argument of democratic institutions and democratic practice.

In contrast, when a successful attack involves the loss of personal financial information, there is a significant shareholder wealth loss, which is much larger than the attack's out-of-pocket costs. This excess loss is higher when the attack decreases sales growth more and lower when the board pays more attention to risk management before the attack. Further, an attack decreases a firm's risk appetite, as it beefs up its risk management and information technology and decreases the risk-taking incentives of management.

This study applied a qualitative approach involving semi-structured in-depth interviews with top management of small service business. Then, we em-ployed the content analysis method to examine interview data and construct a model. This research reveals four main barriers to digital transformation in small service business: lack of funding, lack of digital capability, lack of human resources, and technical barriers. We found there are four government roles for supporting digital transformation in small service business: build a digital platform for small service business, promote mobile/digital payment, provide digital training, and build a digital collaboration ecosystem. Additionally, based on this study's findings, a model for barriers and government support of digital transformation in small service business is presented. This study contributes to the conceptual framework and management implications in the digital transformation field. The study's findings provide insights to practitioners and suggest that the government could alter the current policies and programs to support digital transformation in small service business.",https://doi.org/10.3390/SU13031028,article

To prevent these fires from causing significant damage, an AI-based forest fire detection system is being proposed for use in smart cities to detect and address fires at an early stage. In this paper, we propose a method that uses transfer machine learning techniques to locate fires in digital material. Our approach is predicated on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based on MobileV2 network, that was trained using three dataset of images that featured both fire and non-fire related events. The proposed model is capable to recognize visual cues that indicate the presence of fire, and it makes use of the transfer learning techniques to enhance the fire detection accuracy and effectively assesses whether an input image contains fire or no-fire. The experiments are performed on three fire datasets, a combination of different fire datasets to check the performance of our proposed methods and the results are compared with the classical methods as well as state of the art methods using transfer learning techniques. The results show that the proposed approach achieves 98.42% accuracy, 1.58% error rate, 99.47% recall, and 97.42% precision in classifying the fire and no-fire images. Our approach has the potential to be useful in a range of settings, such as the prevention and extinguishment of fires, the conduct of security and surveillance operations, and the maintenance of public.",https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEEE59925.2023.00009,techreport

Whereas in 2015 about 72% of urban households were grid-connected, this was only true for 5.5% of rural households. Furthermore, the vast majority of rural households use fuel wood, while electricity use, where available, represents a small share of the domestic energy consumption. The LEC data shows that the average consumption per household has decreased by over 60% between 2001 and 2016 in urban households. This indicates that the bulk of new connections are to the rural poor households. This is plausible given that majority of households perceive electricity and other commercial sources of energy to be more expensive than the traditional biomass.

Data are available to show that rural libraries lag behind their urban and suburban counterparts in technology service offerings, but the full meaning and effect of such disparities is unclear. The authors combine data from the Public Library Technology and Access Study with data from smaller studies to provide greater insight to these issues. By filtering these data through the digital inclusion framework, it becomes clear that disparities between rural and nonrural libraries are not merely a problem of weaker technological infrastructure. Instead, rural libraries cannot reach their full customer service potential because of lower staffing (but not lower staff dedication) and funding mechanisms that rely primarily on local monies. The authors suggest possible solutions to these disparities while also discussing the barriers that must be overcome before such solutions can be implemented.",https://doi.org/10.6017/ITAL.V33I1.5141,article

This study presents a new analytical framework based on Amartya Sen's capability approach for a better understanding of rural–urban education disparity. In addition, the rural–urban definitions for educational research are clarified and the effects of a wide range of Central Government policies aimed at reducing the rural–urban educational gap are assessed. The results suggest: inadequate investment (e.g., funding and high-quality teaching resources) in rural education in some regions, especially middle and high schools; inappropriate partitioning of the national territory by the Government for policy implementation; and negative effects resulting from the school consolidation policy. The latter will influence the ability of some rural areas to match the educational achievements of their urban counterparts. This research also reveals that the existing rural–urban gap will be unlikely to narrow under the current policy regime. A conventional approach based on investment and outcomes alone in rural–urban disparity research and policy may overlook the important interactions and conversion processes that are important for mitigating rural–urban disparities.",https://doi.org/10.1007/S12061-023-09506-1,article

"Roe, Jenny J. and {Ward Thompson",2013.0,{Rwanda Smart City Master Plan | The Atlas of Urban Tech,"Contact with green space in the environment has been associated with mental health benefits, but the mechanism underpinning this association is not clear. This study extends an earlier exploratory study showing that more green space in deprived urban neighbourhoods in Scotland is linked to lower levels of perceived stress and improved physiological stress as measured by diurnal patterns of cortisol secretion. Salivary cortisol concentrations were measured at 3, 6 and 9 h post awakening over two consecutive weekdays, together with measures of perceived stress. Participants (n = 106) were men and women not in work aged between 35-55 years, resident in socially disadvantaged districts from the same Scottish, UK, urban context as the earlier study. Results from linear regression analyses showed a significant and negative relationship between higher green space levels and stress levels, indicating living in areas with a higher percentage of green space is associated with lower stress, confirming the earlier study findings. This study further extends the findings by showing significant gender differences in stress patterns by levels of green space, with women in lower green space areas showing higher levels of stress. A significant interaction effect between gender and percentage green space on mean cortisol concentrations showed a positive effect of higher green space in relation to cortisol measures in women, but not in men. Higher levels of neighbourhood green space were associated with healthier mean cortisol levels in women whilst also attenuating higher cortisol levels in men. We conclude that higher levels of green space in residential neighbourhoods, for this deprived urban population of middle-aged men and women not in work, are linked with lower perceived stress and a steeper (healthier) diurnal cortisol decline. However, overall patterns and levels of cortisol secretion in men and women were differentially related to neighbourhood green space and warrant further investigation. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.3390/IJERPH10094086,misc

The drive towards smart cities has produced the need for smart sensors to be able to monitor what is happening in our cities. This, combined with the decrease in hardware component prices and the increase in the popularity of open hardware, has favored the deployment of sensor networks based on open hardware. The new trends in Internet Protocol (IP) communication between sensor nodes allow sensor access via the Internet, turning them into smart objects (Internet of Things and Web of Things). Currently, WSNs provide data in different formats. There is a lack of communication protocol standardization, which turns into interoperability issues when connecting different sensor networks or even when connecting different sensor nodes within the same network. This work presents a sensorized platform proposal that adheres to the principles of the Internet of Things and theWeb of Things. Wireless sensor nodes were built using open hardware solutions, and communications rely on the HTTP/IP Internet protocols.

This study employed a qualitative research approach. The primary data for the study were collected through interviews with local government officials and questionnaires with SMMEs. Purposive sampling was used for selecting local government officials, whereas convenience sampling was used to select SMMEs. Data were analyzed using both conceptual and document analysis methods. The study found that e-government was of little significance to SMMEs because it failed to support them in accessing basic, regulatory, financial, market and technical support services under the municipality's local economic development structures. This study recommends an e-government-SMME framework that enhances the use of e-government services to optimize government support to SMMEs. In accordance with this suggested innovation, SMMEs would use e-government to communicate with stakeholders that provide business assistance and regulatory oversight via easy-to-use access application systems (Apps) and general web-based platforms. As a result, their access to finance, technical assistance, market, and regulatory entities would be increased, helping improve the situation when access to these entities is now viewed as difficult. The innovation is premised on the view that e-government may address most challenges faced by SMMEs in South Africa under the presumption that the country has many support systems and structures that fail to support SMMEs because of poor coordination, poor beneficiary engagement, unnecessary bureaucracy, and corruption. The study's findings are significant considering that it brings a new framework that links e-government services to SMME challenges and solutions.",https://doi.org/10.35741/ISSN.0258-2724.57.4.18,article

While the survival rates for BC are over 90% in many high-income countries; low-and middle-income countries like Nigeria have 40% BC survival rates. Prior studies show that the burden and poor BC survival rates are exacerbated by both health system and individual level factors, yet there is a paucity of literature on the experiences of BC survivors in Nigeria. Hence, this study explored the divergent and convergent experiences of BC survivors in accessing, navigating, and coping with treatment. Methods: Participants (N = 24, aged 35 to 73 years) were recruited and engaged in focus group discussions (group 1, n = 11; group 2, n = 13 participants). Transcripts were transcribed verbatim and analyzed with inductive thematic analysis. Results: Four themes were identified: “I am carrying this [breast cancer] alone,” “Living my life,” “‘God' helped me,” and “A very painful journey.” Participants described how they concealed their BC diagnosis from family and significant others while accessing and navigating BC treatment. Also, they adopted spiritual beliefs as a coping mechanism while sticking to their treatment and acknowledging the burden of BC on their well-being. Conclusions: Our findings explored the emotional burden of BC diagnosis and treatment and the willingness of the BC survivors to find meaning in their diagnosis. Treatment for BC survivors should integrate supportive care and innovative BC access tools to reduce pain and mitigate the burdens of BC. Implications for cancer survivors: The integration of innovative technologies for venous access and other treatment needs of BC is crucial and will improve survivorship. Non-disclosure of BC diagnosis is personal and complicated; hence, BC survivors need to be supported at various levels of care and treatment to make meaningful decisions.

Smart homes, employing passive sensor networks and pervasive computing techniques, enable the unobtrusive assessment of activities and behaviors of the elderly which can be useful for health state assessment and intervention. Due to the multiple health benefits associated with socializing, accurately tracking whether an individual has visitors to their home is one of the more important aspects of elders' behaviors that could be assessed with smart home technology. With this goal, we have developed a preliminary SVM model to identify periods where untagged visitors are present in the home. Using the dwell time, number of sensor firings, and number of transitions between major living spaces (living room, dining room, kitchen and bathroom) as features in the model, and self report from two subjects as ground truth, we were able to accurately detect the presence of visitors in the home with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.90 and 0.89 for subject 1, and of 0.67 and 0.78 for subject 2, respectively. These preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of detecting visitors with in-home sensor data, but highlight the need for more advanced modeling techniques so the model performs well for all subjects and all types of visitors. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2012.6347324,article

The findings suggest general satisfaction with the savings – both in terms of financial burden and time costs that are often incurred when travelling to trials – which TeleCourt allows. As the system improves ways to provide justice to the grassroots, in line with the government's commitment towards peasants, this must also be considered in the context of the Ethiopian government's growing efforts to use law to curb political dissent.

"Toh, Chai K.",2020.0,{Security for smart cities,"Smart cities are evolving globally and many governments have invested large sums of monies to develop smart cities. This development is not a result of an overnight decision but rather, smart cities have evolved through a period of time, directly from earlier work on the digital city to ubiquitous city, green city, connected city, sustainable city, eco-city etc. The present age sees the arrival of very high-speed wireless 5G connectivity, fast GPU multi-core-based servers, big data, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and data analytics. Many of these new technologies have supported the development and realisation of smart cities. In this study, the authors present an outline of security for smart cities and provide a deeper understanding of what we meant by securing smart cities. They discuss the applicability of existing security methods of authentication, access control, encryption, firewalls, and their appropriateness to defending a smart city. Specifically, we cover the security of data, internet, water supply, electricity supply, city brain, and other critical city services and present the possible malicious attacks on a smart city and consequences. Finally, they discuss security best practices for smart cities.",https://doi.org/10.1049/IET-SMC.2020.0001,article

While this technological wave is readily embraced by the younger generation, who find convenience and utility in its offerings, a pressing global concern looms large—the ever-escalating challenge of population aging, which has reached unprecedented levels. The elderly, though esteemed, often find themselves grappling with the intricacies of adapting to an array of digital products and services, resulting in a stark consequence: digital exclusion and division, effectively sidelining China's elderly citizens in an increasingly digitized and intelligent society. Against this backdrop, the harsh spotlight cast by the COVID-19 pandemic on the elderly, seemingly relegated to the margins of society, underscores the glaring dearth of research dedicated to probing the nuances of digital exclusion among China's older adults. This study takes up the crucial mission of dissecting the multifaceted factors contributing to digital exclusion and unraveling the intricate dilemmas surrounding digital inclusion for the elderly. Employing a multifaceted research approach, including offline questionnaires and online data collection, the study harnesses statistical analysis methods to uncover the underpinnings of digital rejection among China's elderly. This analytical journey yields a treasure trove of influential factors, culminating in the creation of a comprehensive evaluation system. The study assigns appropriate weights to these influential factors and employs a random forest model to forecast the extent of digital exclusion among the elderly residing in diverse regions of Tianjin. As a culmination of this extensive investigative endeavor, the study offers a collection of recommendations and strategies aimed at alleviating the predicament of digital exclusion encountered by China's elderly population in the contemporary internet age.",https://doi.org/10.1007/S13132-023-01600-6,article

"Karmarkar, Uday S. and Pitbladdo, Richard",1995.0,{Service markets and competition,"The production and delivery of services differ from manufacturing in ways which have a significant impact on the nature of market competition. Contracts for manufactured goods are centered around a clearly defined junction between production and use, made possible by the properties of tangibility and portability of tangible goods, at which point responsibility for use, operation and consumption of the product is transferred from producer to customer, along with ownership. Service operations, by contrast, involve a lack of inventories and portability, customer contact, joint production, customer-specific inputs, and intangibility in varying degrees. Moreover, service operations are either entirely post contractual or interlinked with the contracting process. As a result, the very nature of service markets and contracting depends on the characteristics of the service operation. While the operational consequences of service characteristics have been explored quite widely, there is less understanding of the special features of service competition and its implications for service strategy. We provide a framework for describing, analyzing and explaining service competition and review some old and new models which address the special features of service markets. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/0272-6963(94)00014-6,article

This article is composed as an early analysis of the air quality sensing project as a framework for the larger smart city story of Christchurch. It provides an overview of the experiences and lessons learned about the implementation of new technologies in a post-disaster environment. We examine how the narrative of the smart city is constructed, with focus on the terminology used by citizens, academicians, government and corporations. We then argue that top-down technocratic solutions to urban problems alone do not suffice to improve life in the city; rather, they can result in misaligned expectations or outcomes for stakeholders at the government and citizen level.

Assessing the role of city rankings in the “global city” discourse,"The last decade has seen “global” and “comparative” forms of urbanism flourish, and critiques thereof expand. While in theory the discussion on the value or shortcomings of global city thinking has thrived, in practice many cities have applied it through expanding international outlooks and collaborations through mounting numbers of partnerships and networks. This has also witnessed a growing sense of competition between peers near and far for investment, talent, and tourism. The “comparative gestures” of cities are increasingly common not just in research but in practice, with expanding ranks of city benchmarking to testify to the popularity of “actually existing” comparative thinking. While there has been a significant rise in the number of city rankings and indexes, as well as increased scholarly interest in comparative urban analysis, how benchmarking is shaping the imagination of those driving urban policymaking or indeed how it relates to global city thinking is still little understood. This study aimed to identify correlations between an appreciation of city rankings and “global city” thinking, especially in cities that have emerged on the “map” of global urbanism. It draws on 170 interviews with a variety of key urban development stakeholders in Dubai, Singapore, and Sydney, focusing on how city rankings relate to the ways we speak of global cities. It suggests a close but nuanced correlation between global city thinking and benchmarking in these cities, but also a wider “map” of comparative gestures than we may have anticipated.",https://doi.org/10.1111/area.12710,article

The selection of smart city verticals (or areas of focus for smart city programs) within processes of urban governance has implications for which aspects of the urban agenda become prioritized. Through a study of seven UK smart cities, the paper investigates the framing of city problems, selection of smart verticals, and decision-making logics. The findings highlight that the selection of smart city verticals within the case study cities is rooted in four key considerations: challenges in service delivery, pragmatism, entrepreneurialism, and broader national and global events and policy agendas.

The paper uses a mixed method approach to develop case studies of the governance models employed. The analysis shows that both cities work along the three dimensions (economic, technological and human) of the sharing paradigm to create a sharing city, with slightly different governance approaches, but both lack institutionalized mechanisms of collaboration.

It argues that, although the mobile phone shutdown was ‘successful' from a military-tactical point of view, it angered citizens and engendered negative opinions toward the state and new emergency policies. While citizens developed various coping and circumventing strategies, Boko Haram evolved from an open network model of insurgency to a closed centralized system, shifting the center of its operations to the Sambisa Forest.

This paper proposes a convolutional neural network based on digital twin models to predict the safety factor of a slope and be evaluate its stability state. In order to solve the problem of lack of the CNN training samples, the digital twin method is resorted to generate 4000 slope models from 10 real slopes by fine-tuning the geometric coordinates and material parameters of their soil layers. The finite element computation of the safety factor of these 4000 slope models were realized by using the parametric analysis of ABAQUS platform and 4000 slope datasets were obtained to serve as the CNN training samples. With the geometric coordinates and material parameters of the slopes as the CNN input and the slope safety factor as the CNN output, the slope safety factor can be effectively predicted. The results show that the prediction accuracy for the testing set reaches 96% and the root mean square error is 0.079.

New smart cities have deepened social and digital inequalities among the technologically savvy residents and those who are usually left behind due to their age, lack of abilities, or resources. The reflective framework for inclusive smart cities offers a comprehensive and holistic approach from the perspective of who is included or excluded, what is the value of digital inclusion, and what are the key premises of inclusive digital governance. What is the implication of the main finding? The framework is meant to act as a starting point in the design of inclusive digital urban policies and strategies and can also be employed to assess the directions taken to date by city governments towards more inclusive practices. While cities on a global scale embrace smartness as a roadmap for efficient urban governance, disparities persist in the domain of digital accessibility, literacy, and skills, with manifestations of digital exclusion, ageism, and ableism prevalent in most digital urban experiences. Despite their commitment to bridging the digital divide, governments lack comprehensive frameworks to inform policymaking and action for inclusion in smart cities. This review paper aims to deepen the understanding of the multifaceted challenges confronting the governance of inclusion in smart cities. Drawing from a review of research encompassing digital inclusion, digital transitions, smart cities, and urban governance, we discuss who is included and excluded in the governance of smart cities; what are the necessary conditions to be met for smart cities to be considered inclusive; and how can smart city governance deliver public value and equal benefits for all.

The findings of this study map out six smart city support systems, which are the government's priority plans, including urban systems, safety and security, livability and urban life, government services, the environment and sustainability, and access and mobility. They all focus on technology adaptation, digitization, renewable energy, and sustainability. Despite these priority plans, there are still significant challenges to rethinking the prospects and potential for developing smart cities in the new capital city, especially the issues of human resources, budget capacity, infrastructure, and government bureaucratic adaptation patterns. This study proposes to set up a smart governance system to adapt to the new system, primarily to accommodate those problems and challenges. It can contribute to unravelling smart cities' complexities, challenges, and future development potential.",https://doi.org/10.46507/JCGPP.V4I2.141,article

Viewed as localized intervention policy implementations, smart cities leverage information infrastructures and distributed renewable energy smart micro-grids, smart meters, and home/building energy management systems to reduce city-wide carbon emissions. However, theory-driven smart city implementation research is critically lacking. This theory-building case study identifies antecedent conditions necessary for implementing smart cities. We integrated resource dependence, social embeddedness, and citizen-centric e-governance theories to develop a citizen-centric social governance framework. We apply the framework to a field-based case study of Japan's Kitakyushu smart community project to examine the validity and utility of the framework's antecedent conditions: resource-dependent leadership network, cross-sector collaboration based on social ties, and citizen-centric e-governance. We conclude that complex smart community implementation processes require shared vision of social innovation owned by diverse stakeholders with conflicting values and adaptive use of informal social governance mechanisms for effective smart city implementation.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0894439315611085,article

These projects, often labelled as “smart city” projects, are typically supported by municipalities, funded by subsidies, and run in partnerships. Many of the projects fade out after the pilot stage, and fail to generate scalable solutions that contribute to sustainable urban development. The lack of scaling is widely perceived as a major problem. In this paper, we analyze processes of upscaling, focusing on smart city pilot projects in which several partners—with different missions, agendas, and incentives—join up. We start with a literature review, in which we identify three types of upscaling: roll-out, expansion, and replication, each with its own dynamics and degree of context sensitivity. The typology is further specified in relation to several conditions and requirements that can impact upscaling processes, and illustrated by a descriptive analysis of three smart city pilot projects developed in Amsterdam. The paper ends with conclusions and recommendations on pilot projects and partnership governance, and adds new perspectives on the debate regarding upscaling.",https://doi.org/10.1080/10630732.2017.1348884,article

In this review, we use “smart cities” as a catch-all term to refer to an emerging concept in urban governance practice and scholarship that has been increasingly applied to achieve public health aims. The objective of this systematic review was to document and analyze the inclusion of equity considerations and dimensions (i.e., a measurement, analytical, or dialectical focus on systematic disparities in health between groups) in smart city interventions aimed to improve human health and well-being. Systematic searches were carried out in the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Psychological Information Database (PsycINFO), the PubMed database from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, Elsevier's database Scopus, and Web of Science, returning 3219 titles. Ultimately, 28 articles were retained, assessed, and coded for their inclusion of equity characteristics using the Cochrane PROGRESS-Plus tool (referring to (P) place of residence, (R) race, (O) occupation, (G) gender, (R) religion, (E) education, (S) socio-economic status (SES), and (S) social capital). The most frequently included equity considerations in smart city health interventions were place of residence, SES, social capital, and personal characteristics; conversely, occupation, gender or sex, religion, race, ethnicity, culture, language, and education characteristics were comparatively less featured in such interventions.

Five tensions in the visions and practices of the smart-sustainable city in Europe and North America,"Smart cities are increasingly advocated by governments and the private sector as the primary means to deliver urban sustainability. Particularly in Europe and North America, the smart city is envisioned as a place where digital technologies are deployed to ‘solve' urban sustainability problems. Such visions have been broadly critiqued in the urban studies literature for reflecting techno-utopian, neoliberal approaches to urban development that exert corporate control over cities, but there has been little empirical verification of these critiques. More recently, a disparate and interdisciplinary body of literature has emerged documenting the impacts of smart city initiatives in practice. This paper provides a state-of-the-art, empirically informed analysis of smart-sustainability, which considers established critiques of smart city policy and visions alongside the increasing body of evidence concerning the actual experiences of smart city initiatives. Through a systematic review of the smart city literature pertaining to Europe and North America, we identify and test five tensions between the smart city and the goals of sustainable urban development. These tensions involve: (1) reinforcing neoliberal economic growth; (2) focusing on more affluent populations; (3) disempowering and marginalising citizens; (4) neglecting environmental protection; and, (5) failing to challenge prevailing consumerist cultures. On the basis of these findings we propose how digital technologists, urban developers, municipalities and citizens might address these tensions. A key finding is that the potential to empower and include citizens represents the key to unlocking forms of smart-sustainable urban development that emphasise environmental protection and social equity, rather than merely reinforcing neoliberal forms of urban development.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.TECHFORE.2018.01.005,article

The making of a smart city imaginary in Kolkata, India","‘Smart' imaginaries have been enthusiastically embraced by urban planners and policymakers around the world. Indians are no exception. Between 2015–2018, following national government guidelines to use participatory and inclusive processes, many cities developed proposals for a smart city challenge. Successful proposals received financial and technical support from the national government. We examine the making of the smart city proposal submitted by New Town Kolkata (NTK). We ask how (un)democratic was the making of the proposal, along three aspects: distributive, participatory, and responsive. Based on an analysis of documents and interviews with policymakers and citizens, we find that NTK's smart city imaginary largely failed to be distributive. It rarely accounted for the specific needs of poorer and vulnerable citizens. City officials invested considerable effort in using participatory techniques, but citizen participation was tightly controlled through top-down design and practice of the techniques. The latter often facilitated one-way flow of information from the city administration to the citizens. The proposal was responsive to some citizens' voices, but only those belonging to the more affluent classes. A messy diversity of citizens' voices was thus closed down, as the city officials filtered and cherry-picked citizens' voices that were well-aligned with the official technocratic vision of ‘global' smart urbanism. The paper shows how democracy can be put in the service of technocracy, within a rhetoric of citizen participation and social inclusion that embodies smart urbanism.",https://doi.org/10.1177/23996544211027583,article

In addition, we make qualitative statements on battery degradation resulting from the charging strategies based on several indicators. We also simulate changes in microgrid composition, for example by including more EVs. In the simulations, self-consumption increases from 49% to 62-87% and demand peaks decrease by 27-67%.

As decision makers strive to find a technological fix, smart city strategies are often based on technological orthodoxies which are conceptually and empirically shallow. The motivation behind this paper is to address the conceptual adolescence which relates to the wholesale digitisation of the city by pursuing a twin argument about the democratic and environmental consequences. The authors draw on interdisciplinary theory and insights from urban studies, infrastructure, informatics, and the sociology of the Internet to critique the way the 'smart city' is taken forward. It is concluded that private firms market smart city services and solutions based on an ideological legacy of 'ubiquitous computing', 'universal infrastructure', and 'green technology'. Based on evidence from three UK cities-Manchester, Birmingham, and Glasgow-it is argued that the underlying principle of future city strategies is to expand the market for new technology products and services to support 'green growth' with disregard for their wider impacts. For citizens, becoming a consumer of the technologies is often presented as progressive 'participation' or 'empowerment' with unknown or hidden consequences both political and environmental. The city systems become a digital marketplace where citizen-consumers' participation is increasingly involuntary and the hegemony of global technology firms is inflated. What follows is that the city's 'intelligent systems' are defined through a digital consumer experience that has inherent biases and leaves parts of the city and its population unaccounted for. This renders the city less resilient in the face of future social and climatic risks. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1068/A46242,article

The article was prepared in the aftermath of the project “ROCK” (2017–2020) on cultural heritage as a driver for urban regeneration, where ULL played a central role being highly relevant in the context of urban regeneration policies. Key findings support that ULL can contribute to finding a balance between top-down and bottom-up strategies and its comparative qualitative analysis would improve the methodology. Moreover, public and private cooperation should be encouraged and government should lead and act as a key player in innovation strategies. Lastly, geography can contribute to these new challenges by framing past approaches, projecting the future of cities, and finding ways to make them become a reality.",https://doi.org/10.11143/FENNIA.97054,article

The present study is based on the development of a situational diagnosis in the scope of a smart city, for the contextualization of potential opportunities for actions and innovation strategies in urban spaces. This article presents a literature overview covering the innovative actions developed in the scope of smart cities in scientific publications. Furthermore, the scope of the study is identifying innovation initiatives in the performance of actions and solutions for urban spaces. A literature review was developed supported by mappings, couplings, and diagrams, through the use of VOSViewer and SciMat software, and 115 articles were selected and analyzed, considering the articles based on the criterion of the coefficient of the number of citations concerning the year of publication. In the literature overview developed, it was found that the research within the scope of smart cities has been deepened over the years, with the evolution of the number of words related to the theme in the period from 2014 to 2021, as the advance in the number of publications from 2018 is noticeable, which highlights the increase in popularity regarding the topic, as well as its current relevance. The study identified thematic axes with an emphasis on technology and innovation, environment, urbanism, energy, governance, mobility, and accessibility. The results contributed by assembling innovative smart city actions and practices in an interrelated way with technology, innovation, and market-oriented constructs aimed to reach urban demands, as well as the development of innovative solutions between public institutions and business organizations to integrate urban spaces.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.HELIYON.2024.E27850,article

In other words, there is limited research on how implementing smart city solutions can lead to co-benefits and/or trade-offs for achieving SDGs. This systematic literature review was conducted to fill this gap. Results show that responsible development/implementation of smart city solutions and technologies could contribute to the progress toward SDGs. The literature is mainly focused on SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), and SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation). More work on other SDGs is needed. There is a bias toward reporting the benefits of smart cities. These include accelerating economic growth, improving efficiency, strengthening innovation, and raising citizen awareness. These benefits indicate that smart cities could catalyze the transition to sustainable development and address climate change challenges. However, this requires addressing trade-offs related to issues such as privacy and cyber security, costs of infrastructure upgrading, rebound effects associated with efficiency improvements, biased decision-making, reproduction of social biases, digital divide and lack of skills, misuse of AI, and limited legal setup. This review elaborates on these trade-offs and offers solutions to minimize them. Results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased attention to the interactions between smart cities and the SDGs, particularly those related to health and climate action. However, it has also cemented many new unethical practices. This review highlights governance/policy challenges that should be addressed to ensure smart cities can better contribute to the SDGs. It concludes that multi-scale and transparent governance mechanisms and regulatory frameworks are crucial for ensuring that smart city solutions support the transition toward sustainable and resilient cities.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2023.104659,article

The research included a field-based study in Hyderabad, a south Indian smart city, using a qualitative explorative research methodology. The research found that, although a supportive regulatory environment helps to create a positive regulatory and cognitive institutional context, normative institutions continue to discourage the positive environment that this context has created. Such a scenario may lead to a ‘talent-in and talent-out' situation that reduces the entrepreneurial potential of the cities.

This was an important milestone in a struggle between IT companies over visibility and legitimacy in the smart city market. Drawing on actor-network theory and critical planning theory, the paper analyzes IBM's smarter city campaign and finds it to be storytelling, aimed at making the company an 'obligatory passage point' in the implementation of urban technologies. Our argument unfolds in three parts. We first trace the emergence of the term 'smart city' in the public sphere. Secondly, we show that IBM's influential story about smart cities is far from novel but rather mobilizes and revisits two long-standing tropes: systems thinking and utopianism. Finally, we conclude, first by addressing two critical questions raised by this discourse: technocratic reductionism and the introduction of new moral imperatives in urban management; and second, by calling for the crafting of alternative smart city stories. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1080/13604813.2014.906716,article

Today, the idea is associated with information and communication technology (ICT) when used in urban areas to improve quality of life, offer more efficient and effective use of cities' infrastructures, foster social inclusion, and mitigate environmental harm. However, the relationship between smart cities and Arctic sustainability remains ambiguous, especially from perspectives beyond those of techno-optimism. Our aim in this paper is to critically discuss the value of smart city concept for Arctic cities, from an urban dynamic perspective. To this end, this paper reflects on how the sustainability of Arctic cities can be challenged by urban dynamics in metrics for (1) smart city development, (2) politics and bureaucratization, and (3) the role of citizens. The paper has several implications for academia, practitioners, and policymakers: for the former, it advances an alternative debate to explore the complex relations between smart city development and Arctic sustainability; for practitioners and policymakers, it indicates the problematic but often hidden side of smart city development, stressing the need to carefully translate the concept and its promises to fit the unique Arctic context.",https://doi.org/10.1080/1088937X.2024.2351496,article

Against this background, the concept of the ""smart city"" has recently been introduced as a strategic device to encompass modern urban production factors in a common framework and, in particular, to highlight the importance of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in the last 20 years for enhancing the competitive profile of a city. The present paper aims to shed light on the often elusive definition of the concept of the ""smart city."" We provide a focused and operational definition of this construct and present consistent evidence on the geography of smart cities in the EU27. Our statistical and graphical analyses exploit in depth, for the first time to our knowledge, the most recent version of the Urban Audit data set in order to analyze the factors determining the performance of smart cities. We find that the presence of a creative class, the quality of and dedicated attention to the urban environment, the level of education, and the accessibility to and use of ICTs for public administration are all positively correlated with urban wealth.

To this, we add six research challenges: to relate the infrastructure of smart cities to their operational functioning and planning through management, control and optimisation; to explore the notion of the city as a laboratory for innovation; to provide portfolios of urban simulation which inform future designs; to develop technologies that ensure equity, fairness and realise a better quality of city life; to develop technologies that ensure informed participation and create shared knowledge for democratic city governance; and to ensure greater and more effective mobility and access to opportunities for urban populations.We begin by defining the state of the art, explaining the science of smart cities. We define six scenarios based on new cities badging themselves as smart, older cities regenerating themselves as smart, the development of science parks, tech cities, and technopoles focused on high technologies, the development of urban services using contemporary ICT, the use of ICT to develop new urban intelligence functions, and the development of online and mobile forms of participation.

The knowledge and innovation economy strand shows that recent technological advancements have introduced a whole new level of knowledge management and innovation capabilities in the urban context. The paper proceeds to explicate the current technology push and demand pull for smart city solutions. On one hand, technology advances rapidly and creates a booming market of smart city products and solutions around it. On the other hand, there is demand on the side of cities that seek to address the problems of efficiency and sustainability, making the ground fertile for a smart city product economy.

More specifically, as a regional innovation in the IoT that covers the morphology of urban extensions, infill and mass retrofits, which smart cities call for the development of. Focusing on the metrics of mass retrofit proposals, the paper also serves to demonstrate how the urban morphology of such regional innovations matter in the sense they tell us that being aware of the considerable energy savings and CO2 reductions, which IoTs offer cities to be smart, is not enough. Not enough, because without knowing whether the costs and benefits under-gridding the sustainability of city-districts are shared equally, it is impossible to say if the 65% energy saving and 78% reduction in CO2, attributed to the data collection, information processing and smart (micro) grids of mass retrofits is socially just.

Based on technological innovations, smart cities are complex ecosystems that have the potential to improve urban livability, workability and sustainability through a network of people, processes and data. However, according to academics and urban planners the smart city concept favors technological products and solutions over end users and their quality of life. This perspective calls for an integrated analysis approach that considers the smart city as an organic whole, which encompasses objective and subjective quality of life domains (QOL). This paper aimed to evaluate the perception of quality of life in a smart city and to analyze the main elements of citizens' satisfaction with their home city. The research analyzed the city of Curitiba, in Southern Brazil, claimed to be a livable, green, and inclusive city and one of the ten smartest cities in the world. Interviews with 400 residents identified four main QOL domains: socio-structural relationships, environmental well-being, material well-being and community integration. The respondents' overall perception revealed their low satisfaction with the main elements that characterize Curitiba as a smart city. This finding calls for a better understanding of the planning and management of smart cities in conjunction with the QOL elements and their effects on citizens. The research provides some contributions to understand the interconnected facets of QOL domains in the Smart Cities context. From a smart city perspective, the research concludes that success within the domain of smart living can be achieved by providing the four factors revealed by the analysis. According to our results, meeting these criteria of success would improve citizen's quality of life, creating a stronger community within the city. Finally, the study provides relevant information for social researchers and urban planners by identifying factors that influence QOL perceptions and providing elements for political and academic debate.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.02.078,article

Increasingly, smart cities are considered as social innovation processes to achieve sustainable and inclusive urban development, being influenced by broader socio-economic and institutional contexts of cities. This paper explores ‘smart city transitions' across varied urban contexts, in particular, how smart city transitions are enacted and how they contribute to inclusive urban transformation and public value. Using a multiple case studies approach, the research investigated infrastructure planning practices in Amsterdam in the Netherlands, Seoul in Korea, Portland in the U.S. and Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) in Vietnam, cities that were known for strong efforts to establish integrated platforms to enhance societal benefits. Our analysis showed that each city has addressed its goals around sustainability, equity and affordability by reinforcing the engagement of multiple actors with the support of integrated platforms that facilitate open and multi-directional information flow in a transparent manner. In Amsterdam, innovative solutions for sustainable use of resources have been invented and distributed through multi-level social networks, contributing to the transformation into a circular economy. In Seoul and HCMC, the city's persistent efforts to utilize an open and integrated platform resulted in proactive engagement and collaboration of public and private actors in improving quality, equity and efficiency of transit services. Portland has tackled inequitable access and mistrust issues by setting principles for data governance and facilitating equity in the adoption of innovative technologies. Our research revealed that four cities established different forms of integrated platforms such as a centrally-controlled platform and a community-centred platform in order to address specific socio-economic issues within an institutional setting of each city. We concluded that building an integrated platform is not easy, but it is a critical prerequisite for the process of sustainable transformation to truly achieve smart cities across the globe.",https://doi.org/10.1080/12265934.2022.2074076,article

This article, however, positions the smart city as significant in its implicit rejection of the strong normativity of traditional technologies of planning, in favour of an ontology of efficiency and emergence. It explores a series of prominent UK smart city initiatives (in Bristol, Manchester and Milton Keynes) as bundles of experimental local practices, drawing on the literature pointing to a growing valorisation of the ‘experimental' over strong policy commitments in urban governance. It departs from this literature, however, by reading contemporary ‘smart experiments' through Shapin and Schafer's work on the emergence of 17th-century science, to advance a transhistorical understanding of experimentation as oriented towards societal reordering. From this perspective, the UK smart city merits attention primarily as an indicator of a wider set of shifts in approaches to governance. Its pragmatic orientation sits uneasily alongside ambitions to ‘standardise' smart and sustainable urban development; and raises questions about the conscious overlap between the stated practical ambitions of smart city initiatives and pre-existing environmental and social policies.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0263775818787506,article

The connotation of a smart city represents city innovation in management and policy as well as technology. Since the unique context of each city shapes the technological, organizational and policy aspects of that city, a smart city can be considered a contextualized interplay among technological innovation, managerial and organizational innovation, and policy innovation. However, only little research discusses innovation in management and policy while the literature of technology innovation is abundant. This paper aims to fill the research gap by building a comprehensive framework to view the smart city movement as innovation comprised of technology, management and policy.

Different smart city frameworks have been proposed and the term “framework” has been defined, examined and proposed in various ways, with each interpretation taking a distinct approach. From a different angle, some frameworks highlight how the smart city concept is implemented, while others concentrate on assessing the initiatives' level of success. An additional collection of frameworks concentrated on the essential elements needed to make up a smart city. This research explicitly analyses frameworks concentrating on fundamental components to identify and suggest essential elements for developing an adaptable, sustainable smart city structure. Using a methodological approach that focused on the core elements of smart city structure, the research comprised of conducting a systematic literature review (SLR), and carrying out an analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) of existing frameworks. Based on the area of focus, the analysed frameworks were grouped into four categories: human-centric, techno-centric, integrated human-techno-centric and environmental-focus frameworks for easy SWOT analysis. The findings revealed that cyber-security issues pose threats to all frameworks and there are technological dependency vulnerabilities. This shows that technology is the driver/enabler of achieving smart city status. In addition, with the help of proper governance and effective management, involving citizens is key to releasing the potential for sustainable smart forms. Hence, the authors believe that technology, good governance, environmental concerns and citizens are essential components of an adaptable, sustainable smart city framework. A framework built on these crucial components is unique because it can be customised to fit any city.

"Capdevila, Ignasi and Zarlenga, Mat{\'{i",2015.0,{Smart city or smart citizens? The Barcelona case,"Purpose – In recent years, the term “smart city” has attracted a lot of attention from policy makers, business leaders and citizenship in general. Although there is not a unique definition of what a smart city is, it is generally accepted that “smart” urban policies refer to local governments' initiatives that use information and communication technologies in order to increase the quality of life of their inhabitants while contributing to a sustainable development. So far, “smart city” approaches have generally been related to top-down processes of technology diffusion. The purpose of this paper is to present a broader view on “smart” initiatives to analyze both top-down and bottom-up dynamics in a smart city. The authors argue that these two perspectives are complementary and its combination can reinforce the collaboration between different city stakeholders. Top-down and bottom-up initiatives are not opposed forces but, on the contrary, can have a synergistic effect on the innovation capacity of the city. Both perspectives are illustrated by providing examples of different “smart” aspects in the city of Barcelona: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. Design/methodology/approach – To illustrate the arguments, the authors analyze the case of the city of Barcelona providing examples of top-down and bottom-up initiatives in four different smart city aspects: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. The research method is based on a case study (Yin, 1984). The primary data consisted on interviews to city council representatives as well as managers of local public institutions, like economic development offices, and local organizations like for instance coworking spaces. The authors interviewed also specialists on the innovation history of the city in order to validate the data. In addition, the authors used secondary data such as reports on the 22@, and documentation on the Barcelona innovation policies, as well as doing a compilation of press articles and the online content of the institutional webpages. All together, the authors have followed a data triangulation strategy to seek data validation based on the cross-verification of the analyzed data sources. Findings – The analysis suggests that the top-down and bottom-up perspectives are complementary and their combination can reinforce the collaboration between different city stakeholders. Top-down and bottom-up initiatives are not opposed forces but, on the contrary, can have a synergistic effect on the innovation capacity of the city. Both perspectives are illustrated by providing examples of different “smart” aspects in the city of Barcelona: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. Research limitations/implications – Nevertheless, the analysis has its limitations. Even if the authors have emphasized the importance of the bottom-up initiatives, citizens do not have often the resources to act without governmental intervention. This is the case of services that require high-cost infrastructures or regulatory changes. Also, as it usually happens in the case of disruptive technology, it is hard for citizens to understand the possibilities of its use. In these cases, firms and institutions must play an important role in the first phases of the diffusion of innovations, by informing and incentivizing its use. It is also important to note that some of the emerging usages of technology are confronted to legal or regulatory issues. For instance, distributed and shared Wi-Fi networks might be in opposition to economic interests of internet providers, that often difficult its expansion. It is also the case of services of the sharing economy that represent a menace to established institutions (like the tensions between Uber and taxi companies, or Airbnb and hotels). In these cases, city halls like it is the case in Barcelona, tend to respond to these emergent uses of technology by regulating to ensure protection to existing corporate services. Practical implications – In conclusion, the transformational process that leads a city to become a smart city has to take in consideration the complexity and the plurality of the urban reality. Beyond considering citizens as being users, testers or consumers of technology, local administrations that are able to identify, nourish and integrate the emerging citizens' initiatives would contribute to the reinforcement of a smart city reality. Originality/value – The contribution of the paper is to go beyond the generalized technologic discourse around smart cities by adding the layer of the citizens' initiatives.",https://doi.org/10.1108/JSMA-03-2015-0030,article

We assess that studies about citizen acceptation of SCTs have been mainly focussed on individual technologies. Also, the review shows that the field is nascent and fragmented, and that a wide variety of variables have been used to predict the adoption of individual-based explicit SCTs, with the classic ones of TAM (perceived use and perceived usefulness) unmistakably being relevant in the smart city context as well.

"Bajdor, Paula and Starostka-Patyk, Marta",2021.0,{Smart city: A bibliometric analysis of conceptual dimensions and areas,"In recent years, cities are expected to develop in line with the smart city (S.C.) idea. Cities, perceived as attractive places for people to live,must now meet many conditions. A city's duty is, among others, to meet the needs and expectations of both, its residents and newcomers, offering a wide range of opportunities for entrepreneurs, caring for the natural environment, constantly taking on new challenges, and meeting them for its further development. Thus, the management of a city involves undertaking activities in line with the smart city idea. However, to implement them, they use widely available means, defined as intelligent solutions, e.g., modern ICT technologies. In line with the smart city idea, a city is a center inhabited by people who create a civic and participatory society, having the ability to use the latest ICT solutions and having access to a range of services and solutions offered by the city. Since the smart city idea is considered at many levels, it is still unknown what dimensions or areas related to this concept are the most valuable and stimulating for its implementation. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to study what dimensions or areas related to this idea are the most valuable and stimulating for its implementation. The applied methodology is based on a critical analysis of the available literature in the form of bibliometric and citation analysis and analysis of the keyword characteristics of S.C. co-occurrences. The result of the research is a set of keywords that enable identifying the key dimensions and main areas of the implementation of S.C.",https://doi.org/10.3390/en14144288,article

The wide-scale proliferation of sensors coupled with the implementation of embedded computational intelligence algorithms can help to tackle many of the technical challenges associated with this energy systems integration problem. Nonetheless, barriers still exist, as suitable methods are needed to handle complex networks of actors, often with competing objectives, while determining design and operational decisions for systems across a wide spectrum of features and time-scales. This review looks at the current developments in the smart energy sector, focussing on techniques in the main application areas along with relevant implemented examples, while highlighting some of the key challenges currently faced and outlining future pathways for the sector. A detailed overview of a framework developed for the EU H2020 funded Sharing Cities project is also provided to illustrate the nature of the design stages encountered and control hierarchies required.

More specifically, this paper aims to provide more insight in the definitions of and relationships between smart governance and concepts such as smart and electronic government, in the context of smart cities. The literature review shows that smart government can be considered as a basis for developing smart governance, through the application of emergent information and communication technologies (ICT) for governing. Smart governance as the intelligent use of ICT to improve decision-making through better collaboration among different stakeholders, including government and citizens, can be strongly related to government approaches. In this case ICT-based tools, such as social media, and openness can be factors that increase citizen engagement and support the development of new governance models for smart government. Smart governance may also have an important role in smart city initiatives, which require complex interactions between governments, citizens and other stakeholders.

The key contributions of this article include an organized evaluation of various big data and smart system technologies and a critical analysis of the state-of-the-art advanced healthcare systems. We describe the three-dimensional structure of a paradigm shift. We also extract three broad technical branches (3T) contributing to the promotion of healthcare systems. More specifically, we propose a big data enabled smart healthcare system framework (BSHSF) that offers theoretical representations of an intra and inter organizational business model in the healthcare context.

While the time seems now ripe to conclude that such policies have a positive impact on urban economic growth, the picture is much less clear when looking at the microfoundations of this effect. In this paper we look at the urban innovation impact of Smart City policies. In fact, typical Smart City projects imply the involvement not only of major multinational corporations, along with local public authorities, but also of local companies, typically with the aim to translate general technological solutions to the local needs. A new data set collected for these analyses comprises data on Smart City features for 309 European metropolitan areas, Smart City policy intensity, and urban innovation outputs. The latter are proxied by calculating total patent applications to the European Patent Office between 2008 and 2013. Patent counts also include technologically narrower classes, namely high-tech, ICT, and specific Smart City technologies patent applications. Propensity Score Matching estimates suggest that cities engaging in Smart City policies above the EU average also tend to patent more intensively. This effect is stronger for high-tech patents, while decreases for more narrowly defined technological classes. This last result suggests possible technological spillovers from technologies directly involved in Smart City policies.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.TECHFORE.2018.07.022,article

Most subjective measures used in practice are unvalidated, and their relationship to system usage is unknown. The present research develops and vandales new scales for two specific variables, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which are hypothesized to be fundamental determinants of user acceptance. Definitions for these two variables were used to develop scale items that were pretested for content validity and then tested for reliability and construct validity in two studies involving a total of 152 users and four application programs. The measures were refined and stream-lined, resulting in two six-item scales with reliabilities of .98 for usefulness and .94 for ease of use. The scales exhibited high convergent, discriminant, and factorial validity. Perceived usefulness was significantly correlated with both self-reported current usage (r=.63, Study 1) and self-predicted future usage (r=.85, Study 2). Perceived ease of use was also significantly correlated with current usage (r=.45, Study 1) and future usage (r=.59, Study 2). In both studies, usefulness had a significantly greater correlation with usage behavior than did ease of use. Regression analyses suggest that perceived ease of use may actually be a causal antecedent to perceived usefulness, as opposed toy a parallel, direct determinant of system usage.

And it is rapidly gaining momentum and worldwide attention as a promising response to the challenge of urban sustainability. This pertains particularly to ecologically and technologically advanced nations. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the field of smart (and) sustainable cities in terms of its underlying foundations and assumptions, state–of–the art research and development, research opportunities and horizons, emerging scientific and technological trends, and future planning practices. As to the design strategy, the paper reviews existing sustainable city models and smart city approaches. Their strengths and weaknesses are discussed with particular emphasis being placed on the extent to which the former contributes to the goals of sustainable development and whether the latter incorporates these goals. To identify the related challenges, those models and approaches are evaluated and compared against each other in line with the notion of sustainability. The gaps in the research within the field of smart sustainable cities are identified in accordance with and beyond the research being proposed. As a result, an integrated approach is proposed based on an applied theoretical perspective to align the existing problems and solutions identification for future practices in the area of smart sustainable urban planning and development. As to the findings, the paper shows that critical issues remain unsettled, less explored, largely ignored, and theoretically underdeveloped for applied purposes concerning existing models of sustainable urban form as to their contribution to sustainability, among other things. It also reveals that numerous research opportunities are available and can be realized in the realm of smart sustainable cities. Our perspective on the topic in this regard is to develop a theoretically and practically convincing model of smart sustainable city or a framework for strategic smart sustainable urban development. This model or framework aims to address the key limitations, uncertainties, paradoxes, and fallacies pertaining to existing models of sustainable urban form—with support of ICT of the new wave of computing and the underlying big data and context–aware computing technologies and their advanced applications. We conclude that the applied theoretical inquiry into smart sustainable cities of the future is deemed of high pertinence and importance—given that the research in the field is still in its early stages, and that the subject matter draws upon contemporary and influential theories with practical applications. The comprehensive overview of and critique on existing work on smart (and) sustainable cities provide a valuable and seminal reference for researchers and practitioners in related research communities and the necessary material to inform these communities of the latest developments in the area of smart sustainable urban planning and development.

Smart places (cities, districts, neighbourhoods, ecosystems) depend on the way digitalisation disrupts systems of innovation in cities, making it more open, global, participatory and experimental. We argue that the rise and interconnection of various types of intelligence (artificial, human, collective) could bring profound changes in the way smart places are being created and evolve. In this context, cyber-physical systems of innovation are deployed through multiple nodes acquiring digital companions, collaboration is deployed over physical, social, and digital spaces, and actors can use complex methods guided by software and get insights from data and analytics. The paper also presents the case study of OnlineS3, a two-year Horizon 2020 project, which developed and tested a digital platform composed of applications, datasets and roadmaps, which altogether create a digital environment for empowering the design of smart specialisation strategies for local and regional systems of innovation. The results indicate that digital transformation allows the operationalisation of multiple methodologies which have not been used earlier by policy makers, due to lack of capabilities. It can also increase the scalability of indicators facilitating decision making at different spatial scales and, therefore, better respond to the complexity of innovation systems providing dynamic and scale-diverse information.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2020.104631,article

To achieve urban sustainability objectives, the notion of a “smart city” becomes a promising policy option. Yet, little is known about the emergence of smart urban solutions in the African context. Analyzing Accra City Extension Project (ACEP)—an urban strategy for urbanization pressures in the Greater Accra Region, Ghana, this chapter contributes to understandings of the “how” and “why” particular smart urban solutions emerge and are adopted in African cities. Through in-depth interviews and document analysis, the findings indicate that multiple rationalities, including achieving orderly and efficient spatial development, infrastructure provision, liveability, land value capture, and inclusive urban development underpin the production of ACEP. Multiple actors such as central and local governments, traditional authorities, landowners, technocrats, private developers, residents, and transnational organizations with varied interests were involved in ACEP. To private investors and landowners, economic values were the main motivations; however, this is contrary to the general project visions of promoting urban sustainability and social inclusion. There was evidence of parallel and conflicting institutional arrangement for the project implementation. It is concluded that the project risks not achieving its aim of creating a sustainable, inclusive, and liveable urban environment, and at worst, it might become an urban fantasy plan that deepens inequality and marginalization.",https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-818886-6.00009-5,article

The research consisted of three levels of data generation and analysis: a discourse analysis of policy documents and project descriptions of the 61 Commitments in the European Innovation Partnership for Smart Cities and Communities ‘citizen-focus' cluster; interviews with a dozen stakeholders working on citizen engagement in a small sample of European Innovation Partnership for Smart Cities and Communities flagship projects; and twenty interviews with city officers and corporate exhibitors at the 2017 Smart City Expo and World Congress. We contend that smart cities as currently conceived enact a blueprint of neoliberal urbanism and promote a form of neoliberal citizenship. Supra-national institutions like the European Innovation Partnership for Smart Cities and Communities act at a multi-scalar level, connecting diverse forms of neoliberal urbanism whilst promoting policy agendas and projects that perform neoliberal citizenship in the spaces of the everyday. Despite attempts to recast the smart city as ‘citizen-focused', smart urbanism remains rooted in pragmatic, instrumental and paternalistic discourses and practices rather than those of social rights, political citizenship, and the common good. In our view, if smart cities are to become truly ‘citizen-focused', an alternative conception of smart citizenship needs to be deployed, one that enables an effective shift of power and is rooted in the right to the city, entitlements, community, participation, commons, and ideals beyond the market.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0263774X18806508,article

Overview of the key terms, concepts and definitions associated to smart cities, reported in this paper, demonstrates that the definitions found in the academic literature have limited scope, and are overly focused on strategic drivers and specific actions, instead of making explicitly the connection between the concept of smart cities and the creation of environments that promote happiness and wellbeing of their residents-which should be the main function of a city. Following the thorough review on the smart cities literature, the paper proposes a comprehensive, human-centred, and context-free definition for smart cities. This definition brings an endogenous view on smart cities in which the central element is the direct participation of local actors and stakeholders in the process of thinking, defining, planning, and executing social, technological and urban transformations in cities.",https://doi.org/10.1186/S40852-016-0034-Z,article

Design Automated double-blind randomised controlled trial with 6 months follow-up (2014-2015). Setting Smartphone-based. Participants 684 participants (daily smokers of cigarettes, 18 years old or over) recruited passively from app stores in the USA, Australia, UK and Singapore, and randomised to one of two sub-apps. Intervention(s) Behavioural, decision-aid, smartphone application. Main outcome(s) Continuous abstinence at 10 days, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months. Results Smokers who received the decision-aid app were more likely to be continuously abstinent at 1 month compared with the information-only app (28.5% vs 16.9%; relative risk (RR) 1.68; 95% CI 1.25 to 2.28). The effect was sustained at 3 months (23.8% vs 10.2%; RR 2.08; 95% CI 1.38 to 3.18) and 6 months (10.2% vs 4.8%; RR 2.02; 95% CI 1.08 to 3.81). Participants receiving the decision-aid app were also more likely to have made an informed choice (31.9% vs 19.6%) and have lower decisional conflict (19.5% vs 3.9%). Conclusion A smartphone decision-aid app with support features significantly increased smoking cessation and informed choice. With an increasing number of smokers attempting to quit, unassisted evidence-based decision-aid apps can provide an effective and user-friendly option to many who are making quit decisions without healthcare professionals.

Having citizens involved in the process through mobile crowdsensing (MCS) augments the capabilities of the platform without enquiring additional costs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for data acquisition in MCS deployed over a fog computing platform which facilitates a number of key operations including user recruitment and task completion. Proper data acquisition minimizes the monetary expenditure the platform sustains to recruit and compensate users as well as the energy they spend to sense and deliver data. We propose a new user recruitment policy called Distance, Sociability, Energy (DSE). This policy exploits three criteria: (i) spatial distance between users and tasks, (ii) user sociability, which is an estimate of the willingness of users to contribute to sensing tasks, and (iii) remaining battery charge of the devices. Performance evaluation is conducted in a real urban environment for a large number of participants with new metrics assessing the efficiency of recruitment and the accuracy of task completion. Results reveal that the average number of recruited users improves by nearly 20 percent if compared to policies using only spatial distance as selection criterion.",https://doi.org/10.1109/TSUSC.2017.2702060,article

Given the context-dependent nature of online learning, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was adopted and supplemented with components largely relevant to harnessing social media for collaborative learning and engagement. Collaborative learning, student participation, and a social media mindset are just a few of the new features. The enlarged model was validated using empirical data from an online survey questionnaire filled by a sample of 409 Saudi Arabia higher education students, which assesses students' social media usage intentions and academic performance during the COVID-19 Pandemic. AMOS-SEM was used to analyze the model's various assumptions (Analysis of Moment Structures- Structural Equation Modeling). The findings revealed that: (1) utilizing social media for collaborative learning and student engagement has a direct positive impact on perceived usefulness, ease of use, and enjoyment; (2) perceived usefulness, ease of use, and enjoyment has a direct positive impact on attitude to use social media; and (3) the link between TAM characteristics “usefulness, ease of use, and pleasure” and behavior intention to use social media is mediated by attitude to use social media.

Using a mixed-methods research design, we interviewed 19 students from two liberal Nigerian universities who participated in the protest. We also analysed 13,031 contents from protesters' Facebook posts and tweets of the Occupy Nigeria protests. Our data reveal that social media platforms were used most by the protesters to plan and organise for the 2012 Occupy Nigeria protest. Our findings also show that the local mainstream media acquiesced to the pressure from government officials by refusing to cover the protest at its inception until they were forced to do so by the protesters. This perceived inaction by the local mainstream media was cited by some of our interview participants as a source of motivation to participate in the protest. Using social capital theory, this paper argues that social media—the fifth estate—brought about interaction, socialisation, collective engagement, and liberation that was not present in the mainstream media.",https://doi.org/10.1080/23743670.2018.1473274,article

After a brief review of conceptions of social exclusion and some of the key controversies, we operationalize one definition based on the notion of participation in five types of activity-consumption, savings, production, political and social. Using the British Household Panel Survey, indicators for participation on these dimensions are developed and analysed both cross-sectionally and longitudinally for the period 1991-5. We find strong associations between an individual's participation (or lack of it) on the five different dimensions, and on each dimension over time. However, there is no distinct group of socially excluded individuals: few are excluded on all dimensions in any one year and even fewer experience multiple exclusion for the whole period.

Protest groups, predominantly organized along ethnic identification, have used social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter to disseminate strategies, recruit members, and galvanize support. Anchored on theories of collective identity and moral outrage, this study investigates the role of social media platforms in mobilizing Ethiopians toward political reform during the protest and post-protest periods demarcated by the ascent of Abiy Ahmed as the new Prime Minister of Ethiopia. Data generated from a mixed method approach consisting of an online survey and interviews indicate social media platforms played a crucial role by drawing Ethiopian youth to participate in political discourse, empowering formerly marginalized groups to influence policy, and fostering ingroup cultural/political cohesion. However, evidence indicates participation opportunities created by social media platforms also brought apprehension including the rise of outrage communication as manifested by inflammatory expressions, hate speech, and political extremism. By proposing outrage communication as a viable construct that captures this phenomenon, I argue, in the context of a polity embodying highly heterogeneous and competing collective identities–ethnic or otherwise–such as Ethiopia, social media platforms are likely to increase ingroup political participation but chronically diminish outgroup engagement.",https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2020.1811367,article

By drawing on the ‘Typology of digital social support' framework, this paper presents rich insights into the intricacies of the underlying motivations, behaviour and help-seeking processes in the digital engagement of women in South African townships. The findings show that the women had the strong social embeddedness necessary for digital support and relied on a range of nuanced and cross-cutting support-seeking strategies, including formal and particularly informal support channels and, to a lesser extent, self-learning. This qualitative phenomenological study relies on in-depth individual interviews with a small sample of women in three South African townships.

Public policies and economic practices which increase marginalisation act to damage the “weak ties” of the community social networks which bind central city neighbourhoods into functioning units. Spreading disease and disorder can be interpreted as indices of the resulting social disintegration, which is driven by policy.

A church of the early 8th century AD was already located here. In a short period of time, Vlaardingen developed in the 11th century AD into an international trading place and into one of the most important places in the former county of Holland. Starting from the 11th century AD, the river Maas repeatedly threatened to flood the settlement. The flood dynamics were registered in Fluvisol archives and were recognised in a multidisciplinary sedimentary analysis of these archives. To secure the future of these vulnerable soil archives an extensive interdisciplinary research effort (76 mechanical drill holes, grain size analysis (GSA), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), archaeological remains, soil analysis, dating methods, micromorphology, and microfauna) started in 2011 to gain knowledge on the sedimentological and pedological subsurface of the settlement mound as well as on the well-preserved nature of the archaeological evidence. Pedogenic features are recorded with soil description, micromorphological, and geochemical (XRF-X-ray fluorescence) analysis. The soil sequence of 5m thickness exhibits a complex mix of ""natural"" as well as ""anthropogenic"" layering and initial soil formation that enables us to make a distinction between relatively stable periods and periods with active sedimentation. In this paper the results of this interdisciplinary project are demonstrated in a number of cross-sections with interrelated geological, pedological, and archaeological stratification. A distinction between natural and anthropogenic layering is made on the basis of the occurrence of the chemical elements phosphor and potassium. A series of four stratigraphic and sedimentary units record the period before and after the flooding disaster. Given the many archaeological remnants and features present in the lower units, in geological terms it is assumed that the medieval landscape was submerged while it was inhabited in the 12th century AD. In reaction to a final submersion phase in the late 12th century AD, the inhabitants started to raise the surface of the settlement.Within archaeological terms the boundary between natural and anthropogenic layers is stratigraphically lower, so that in the interpretation of archaeologists, the living ground was dry during the 12th and the 13th centuries AD. In this discussion, the geological interpretation will be compared with alternative archaeological scenarios.",https://doi.org/10.5194/SOIL-2-271-2016,article

With the novel COVID-19 pandemic, ubiquitous use of the internet has changed the daily lives of individuals, from working from home to seeking and meeting with health care providers through web-based sites. Such heavy reliance on internet-based technologies raises concerns regarding the accessibility of the internet for minority populations who are likely to already face barriers when seeking health information. Objective: This study aims to examine the level of technology access and common modes of technology used by Korean American women and to investigate how key psychosocial determinants of health such as age, education, English proficiency, and health literacy are correlated with sources of health information used by Korean American women and by their use of the internet. Methods: We used data from a subsample of Korean American women (N=157) who participated in a community-based randomized trial designed to test a health literacy-focused cancer screening intervention. In addition to descriptive statistics to summarize Korean American women's internet access and common modes of technology use, we conducted backward stepwise logistic regression analyses to substantiate the association between the psychosocial determinants of health and internet use. Results: Approximately two-thirds (103/157, 65.6%) of the sample had access to the internet, and nearly all had access to a mobile phone. The internet was the most commonly used channel to obtain health information 63% (99/157), and 70% (110/157) of the sample used text messaging. Nevertheless, only approximately 38.8% (40/103) of the sample were very confident in using the internet, and only 29.9% (47/157) were very confident in using text messaging. Multivariate analyses revealed that older age (>50 years) was associated with 79% lower odds of using the internet to seek health information (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.21, 95% CI 0.10-0.46).

The South Korean governments set the goal to increase urban energy self-sufficiency through renewable energy generation and implemented various urban energy projects. However, the outcome of those urban green energy projects showed a varying degree of success. While the top-down approach led by the government facilitated the spread of urban green energy strategies in a short period of time, it also showed some drawbacks, such as the gap of willingness between the central government and the local governments and low level of community involvement. Although the importance of citizen participation in the transition to urban energy self-sufficiency has been emphasized in a rhetoric, energy projects that residents played a key role were rare in Korea. The urban energy transition in the low carbon green city projects needs to be supplemented by reinforced bottom-up approaches with the momentum from local governments as well as active citizen participation during the planning and implementation process.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2015.10.011,article

Nevertheless, vagueness remains concerning the concept of spatial thinking and its components. The aim of this paper is to review previous studies on the relationship between GIScience and spatial thinking, and to clarify the elements of spatial thinking and related terms. After discussing the basic elements of spatial thinking, it explores the relationship between GIScience and spatial thinking by dividing it into two aspects: the role of geographic information systems (GIS) in education on spatial thinking, and the role of spatial thinking in GIScience. Concerning the former, potential roles of GIS in spatial thinking education, particularly in geography and STEM disciplines, are suggested. Concerning the latter, the relationships between the body of knowledge on GIS education and the elements of spatial thinking are examined. Finally, the present situation and future prospects for studies on spatial thinking and GIScience in Japan are briefly discussed. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.SBSPRO.2011.07.031,article

Part of these strategies is to develop new types of innovation approaches in urban areas, which are characterized, firstly, by a high level of citizen involvement in co-creating Internet-based applications in all sectors of the economy and society; secondly, by the emergence of new forms of collaboration among local governments, research institutes, universities, and companies. Such strategies and the resulting ""innovation ecosystems"" are becoming increasingly relevant given the growing economic and social issues and opportunities that cities are currently facing. This special issue investigates these smart city strategies through four smart city case studies and two papers addressing horizontal issues. The case studies aim to analyze the currently emerging strategies and policies related to identify how the opportunities of the Future Internet are being used for the socio-economic development of urban areas. The four cases also address how cities are redefining their innovation structures and how they started to experiment citizens involvement within the context of open innovation, and present lessons learned that are of interest to smart city stakeholders. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1007/S13132-012-0083-X,article

Z{\'{e,2008.0,{Splintering urbanism in Mumbai: Contrasting trends in a multilayered society,"This paper is an examination of the splintering urbanism argument of the relationship between neo-liberal reforms of infrastructure networks and urban cohesion. Based on an analysis of historical and contemporary processes of infrastructure provision (water, sewerage and power) in colonial/post-colonial Bombay/Mumbai, it questions the assumption of a ""modern infrastructure ideal"" in the context of developing cities. In Mumbai, the historical analysis reveals the contradictions between this ideal and a hierarchical society. From the outset, access to services (particularly water and sewerage) was highly distorted in favour of the elites, even though utilities networks contributed to urban integration through cross-subsidies within and across sectors, and through the setting up of municipal institutions. Second, ongoing sectoral reforms demonstrate contrasting trends as increased differentiation of services produces both positive - better adaptation to users' needs - and potentially negative - fragmenting - socio-spatial implications. Third, an understudied potential fragmenting threat also lies in the sectoral approach to reforms as it undermines the existing crosssector subsidies and prevents the articulation of utility reforms with other limiting factors, such as land and transport, which are the main constraints for expanding housing and mobility in the city. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoforum.2008.02.001,article

We have studied a city district development in Sweden where a new planning approach was implemented. The developed framework was used to analyze the complexity of this city planning process. By defining which smartness dimension each stakeholder primarily focus on and analyzing the consequences of this, the framework pinpoints each stakeholder's contribution and/or hindrance to the process and outcome. A recommendation from this study is that new stakeholder groups are important to involve in smart city planning, but this also adds complexity that must be acknowledged when setting up this kind of projects.

Most studies compare travel patterns for people located in different types of neighborhoods at one point in time adjusting for demographics. Most fail to account for either underlying neighborhood selection factors (reasons for choosing a neighborhood) or preferences (neighborhoods that are preferred) that impact neighborhood selection and behavior. Known as self-selection, this issue makes it difficult to evaluate causation among built form, behavior, and associated outcomes and to know how much more walking and less driving could occur through creating environments conducive to active transport. The current study controls for neighborhood selection and preference and isolates the effect of the built environment on walking, car use, and obesity. Separate analyses were conducted among 2056 persons in the Atlanta, USA based Strategies for Metropolitan Atlanta's Regional Transportation and Air Quality (SMARTRAQ) travel survey on selection factors and 1466 persons in the SMARTRAQ community preference sub-survey. A significant proportion of the population are ""mismatched"" and do not live in their preferred neighborhood type. Factors influencing neighborhood selection and individual preferences, and current neighborhood walkability explained vehicle travel distance after controlling for demographic variables. Individuals who preferred and lived in a walkable neighborhood walked most (33.9% walked) and drove 25.8 miles per day on average. Individuals that preferred and lived in car dependent neighborhoods drove the most (43 miles per day) and walked the least (3.3%). Individuals that do not prefer a walkable environment walked little and show no change in obesity prevalence regardless of where they live. About half as many participants were obese (11.7%) who prefer and live in walkable environments than participants who prefer car dependent environments (21.6%). Findings suggest that creating walkable environments may result in higher levels of physical activity and less driving and in slightly lower obesity prevalence for those preferring walkability. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.SOCSCIMED.2007.05.053,article

There are several established and emerging approaches to such reviews, but unanswered questions remain, especially around how to begin to make sense of large data sets drawn from heterogeneous sources. Drawing on Kuhn's notion of scientific paradigms, we developed a new method - meta-narrative review - for sorting and interpreting the 1024 sources identified in our exploratory searches. We took as our initial unit of analysis the unfolding 'storyline' of a research tradition over time. We mapped these storylines by using both electronic and manual tracking to trace the influence of seminal theoretical and empirical work on subsequent research within a tradition. We then drew variously on the different storylines to build up a rich picture of our field of study. We identified 13 key meta-narratives from literatures as disparate as rural sociology, clinical epidemiology, marketing and organisational studies. Researchers in different traditions had conceptualised, explained and investigated diffusion of innovations differently and had used different criteria for judging the quality of empirical work. Moreover, they told very different over-arching stories of the progress of their research. Within each tradition, accounts of research depicted human characters emplotted in a story of (in the early stages) pioneering endeavour and (later) systematic puzzle-solving, variously embellished with scientific dramas, surprises and 'twists in the plot'. By first separating out, and then drawing together, these different meta-narratives, we produced a synthesis that embraced the many complexities and ambiguities of 'diffusion of innovations' in an organisational setting. We were able to make sense of seemingly contradictory data by systematically exposing and exploring tensions between research paradigms as set out in their over-arching storylines. In some traditions, scientific revolutions were identifiable in which breakaway researchers had abandoned the prevailing paradigm and introduced a new set of concepts, theories and empirical methods. We concluded that meta-narrative review adds value to the synthesis of heterogeneous bodies of literature, in which different groups of scientists have conceptualised and investigated the 'same' problem in different ways and produced seemingly contradictory findings. Its contribution to the mixed economy of methods for the systematic review of complex evidence should be explored further. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.SOCSCIMED.2004.12.001,article

Market failures call for government interventions in supporting STI for SDGs and publicly-funded incubators can potentially fulfil this role. Using the specific case of India, we examine how publicly-funded incubators could contribute to strengthening STI-based entrepreneurship. India's STI policy and its links to societal goals span multiple decades—but since 2015 these goals became formally organized around the SDGs. We examine why STI-based incubators were created under different policy priorities before 2015, the role of public agencies in implementing these policies, and how some incubators were particularly effective in addressing the societal challenges that can now be mapped to SDGs. We find that effective incubation for supporting STI-based entrepreneurship to meet societal goals extended beyond traditional incubation activities. For STI-based incubators to be effective, policymakers must strengthen the ‘incubation system'. This involves incorporating targeted SDGs in specific incubator goals, promoting coordination between existing incubator programs, developing a performance monitoring system, and finally, extending extensive capacity building at multiple levels including for incubator managers and for broader STI in the country.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.TECHFORE.2020.120057,article

In this article, we present a case study of smart health in Kashiwanoha Smart City in Japan. We explore how the pursuit of greater health and well-being has stretched smart city activities beyond technological innovation to directly impact resident lifestyles and become more socially relevant. Smart health strategies examined include a combination of experiments in monitoring and visualisation, education through information provision, and enticement for behavioural change. Findings suggest that smart cities have great potential to be designed and executed to tackle social problems and realise more sustainable, equitable and liveable cities.",https://doi.org/10.1080/13549839.2017.1360264,article

"Zafra, Richelle G. and Mayo, John Rheynor M. and Villareal, Patrick Jasper M. and {De Padua",2021.0,{Structural and thermal performance assessment of shipping container as post-disaster housing in tropical climates,"Shipping Containers (SC) are a viable option as temporary or permanent housing for disaster victims due to their modularity, strength, and availability in large quantities around the world. While SCs as alternative housing has been extensively explored, few studies have focused on the structural and thermal performance of SCs in a tropical monsoon climate. This paper aims to contribute to a better knowledge of SC building construction by (1) investigating the SCs structural performance when subjected to a variety of loads, including gravity, earthquake, and very strong typhoon, and (2) assessing the thermal performance in a hot and humid climate. The case of Leyte, Philippines, a hot, humid, and typhoon-frequented region, is considered in this study. To meet the objectives, two SCs were combined to build a single-family house. First, the structural strength of the SCs, including the effect of cuts and openings, were investigated using finite element analysis. Second, the thermal condition of the SC was compared using four models with different insulation materials: no insulation, PE foam insulation (R-12), slightly higher insulation (R-13 fiberglass batt), and very high insulation (R-49 fiberglass batt) through building energy simulation. The paper concludes that SCs have inherently high strength and can withstand strong wind and earthquake. Stresses due to cuts and openings were minimized when the cuts/openings were placed far from the corner posts. On the other hand, increasing insulation R-value did not improve the indoor thermal condition of the SCs. More work needs to be done on making SCs thermally comfortable in hot and humid climates.",https://doi.org/10.28991/CEJ-2021-03091735,article

This study imparts results from an investigation of undergraduate students' participation in an interprofessional education (IPE) programme focusing on working with children (0–18). The programme participants include students across the disciplines of education, health, and social care. In the study the students' accounts of group processes by which they negotiated their positions and the relevance of their emerging professional knowledge in interprofessional student groups are explored. The more overarching aim is to contribute to a knowledge base serving the development of broad IPE initiatives. Qualitative interviews were conducted with students (n = 15) to explore their experiences participating in the programme. Positioning theory was used as an analytical framework. The results indicate that the students' joint constructions of the aim of the learning activity were vital for their joint meaning-making in the interprofessional learning (IPL) groups and for processes of positioning. In addition, students' participation in the IPL groups was closely linked to their approach to negotiations of relevance.

This research examined factors influencing the digital inclusion of older adults in China and the relationship between digital inclusion and quality of life. Data collected from 312 older people (M = 69.6 years old) in Nanjing were included in a multinomial logit model to tackle these questions. Their attitudes toward technology were the most significant factor predicting their digital inclusion. Other factors included party affiliation, living situation, personal average monthly income, occupation, and capacity for instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). This study shows digital inclusion has a direct impact on quality of life. It also serves as an intermediate variable that affects older people's attitudes toward technology and their IADL capacities. Most importantly, digital inclusion promotes social integration of older adults and improves the quality of their lives. Hence, it should not be ignored.

Scholars have explored sustainable urbanization, collected relevant literature, and analyzed the influence of research in different countries, finding that China's influence is second only to that of the US. Accordingly, this study uses the literature in China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), the world's largest Chinese database. It selects 3640 studies on sustainable urbanization from Web of Science and Scopus (W&S), and CNKI. Using the bibliometric method in Citespace, it systematically analyzes the research status, development course, and potential trends of research on sustainable urbanization. The results show that: (1) The number of studies on sustainable urbanization in CNKI is decreasing by year, while it has increased gradually in W&S. China currently has the most literature in the field of sustainable urbanization. The US, China, and Germany have the most influential studies. (2) W&S and CNKI each have their separate and complementary emphases. (3) The two datasets are more similar in terms of the nature of their research institutions, but cooperation between the institutions is closer in W&S than in CNKI. There are no aggregation or scaling effects in the Chinese research institutions. The Chinese Academy of Sciences and Hong Kong Polytechnic University are leaders in this field. (4) The top five topics in the studies from W&S are urban development models and public administration, urban planning issues, protection of urban ecosystems, urban land-use changes, and pollution and resource consumption during urbanization. The top five topics in the CNKI studies are strategy of sustainable development, urban development, urbanization and population urbanization, land financing and urban economics, and urban development planning. The construction of urban ecosystems with reasonable structure, efficient processes, and complete functions is an important breakthrough in the application of sustainable urbanization. Reasonably controlling the pace of urban expansion, efficiently coordinating urban and rural development, formulating evidence-based urban development strategies, and ensuring the living standard of urban settlements are the key problems in sustainable urbanization, and will become important directions for related future research.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.JCLEPRO.2020.121537,article

Attention has shifted from late C20th information technologies and networks to a C21st focus on data, currently crystallized in “Big Data.” Big Data intensifies certain surveillance trends associated with information technology and networks, and is thus implicated in fresh but fluid configurations. This is considered in three main ways: One, the capacities of Big Data (including metadata) intensify surveillance by expanding interconnected datasets and analytical tools. Existing dynamics of influence, risk-management, and control increase their speed and scope through new techniques, especially predictive analytics. Two, while Big Data appears to be about size, qualitative change in surveillance practices is also perceptible, accenting consequences. Important trends persist – the control motif, faith in technology, public-private synergies, and user-involvement – but the future-orientation increasingly severs surveillance from history and memory and the quest for pattern-discovery is used to justify unprecedented access to data. Three, the ethical turn becomes more urgent as a mode of critique. Modernity's predilection for certain definitions of privacy betrays the subjects of surveillance who, so far from conforming to the abstract, disembodied image of both computing and legal practices, are engaged and embodied users-in-relation whose activities both fuel and foreclose surveillance.",https://doi.org/10.1177/2053951714541861,article

"Davidson, Mark",2010.0,{Sustainability as ideological praxis: The acting out of planning's master-signifier,"The rise and rise of sustainability in urban and social policy circles has transformed the discursive terrain of urban politics. In 2009, Gunder and Hillier argued sustainability is now urban planning's central empty signifier, offering an overarching narrative around which practice can be oriented. This paper takes up the notion of sustainability as an empty/master-signifier, arguing that the recognition of its nominal status is central to understanding how it operates to produce ideological foundation. Drawing upon a series of interviews and focus groups with urban and social policy makers and practitioners in Vancouver, Canada, Zizek's 1989 critique of the cynical functioning of contemporary ideology is used to interpret the city's engagement with sustainability. Focusing on 'social sustainability' it is argued that sustainability has provided a quilting point that has enabled new social and urban policy-related partnerships and organizational agendas to be developed. However, this coherence remains unstable and plagued by questions of signification due to the radical negativity of the master-signifier, where efforts at definition and agreement are haunted by the non-presence of sustainability. It is argued that this framing of sustainability as ideological conduit in Vancouver helps explain the co-presence of transformative rhetoric and business-as-usual. Using Zizek's critique of cynical reason in contemporary ideology, interview data is drawn upon to show how many practitioners seek to distance themselves from sustainability, but at the same time continue to act it out anyway. In conclusion, the sobering politics of Zizek's critique of contemporary ideology are considered in the light of growing urban problems. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1080/13604813.2010.492603,article

An online survey was conducted using a random sample of students at the University of Jordan, which reached 576 participants. The results of a subsequent path analysis of the survey data revealed that PE, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and attitudes toward using digital communication strategies were dominant in affecting student intention to use sustainable digital communication. We found that the students would like to use digital communication strategies due to their ease of use and because they can enhance self-education. However, students need to enhance their usage skills, and to better understand digital communication strategies. Moreover, we found that the TAM, PE, perceived ease of use (PEU), and perceived usefulness (PU) immediately and favorably affect attitudes toward usage (ATU) and behavioral intention (BI). PEU negatively affected the intention of students to use technology through ATU, while PE had a significant impact on the PU, PEU, ATU, and BI of using digital communication strategies.

The results were consistent with the actual situation and indicated that over time, sustainable urbanization in Henan developed towards a more harmonious and orderly state, though the overall synergy degree was not high. It was found that the model was a sound basis for scientific judgment and effective decision-making when seeking to coordinate sustainable urbanization.",https://doi.org/10.3390/SU10010009,article
{De Jong,2015.0,{Sustainable-smart-resilient-low carbon-eco-knowledge cities; Making sense of a multitude of concepts promoting sustainable urbanization,"Over the last couple of decades, metropolitan areas around the world have been engaged in a multitude of initiatives aimed at upgrading urban infrastructure and services, with a view to creating better environmental, social and economic conditions and enhancing cities' attractiveness and competitiveness. Reflecting these developments, many new categories of 'cities' have entered the policy discourse: 'sustainable cities'; 'green cities'; 'digital cities'; 'smart cities'; intelligent cities'; 'information cities'; 'knowledge cities'; 'resilient cities'; 'eco cities'; 'low carbon cities'; 'liveable cities'; and even combinations, such as 'low carbon eco cities' and 'ubiquitous eco cities'. In practice, these terms often appear to be used interchangeably by policy makers, planners and developers. However, the question arises whether these categories nevertheless each embody distinct conceptual perspectives, which would have implications for how they are understood theoretically and applied in policy. In response, this article investigates, through a comprehensive bibliometric analysis, how the twelve most frequent city categories are conceptualised individually and in relation to one another in the academic literature. We hypothesize that, notwithstanding some degree of overlap and cross-fertilization, in their essence the observed categories each harbor particular conceptual perspectives that render them distinctive. This is borne out by the findings, which demonstrate robustly for the first time the conceptual differences and interrelationships among twelve dominant city categories. The 'sustainable city' is the most frequently occurring category and, in a map of keyword co-occurrences, by far the largest and most interconnected node, linked closely to the 'eco city' and 'green city' concepts. Recently, the more narrow concepts of 'low carbon city' and 'smart city' have been on the rise, judging by their frequency of occurrence in academic journals; the latter in particular appears to have become an increasingly dominant category of urban modernization policy. On their part, 'resilient city' and 'knowledge city' represent distinct concepts, albeit with comparatively low frequency. Overall, the findings point to the need for rigor and nuance in the use of these terms, not least if one wishes to comprehend their implications for urban development and regeneration policy and practice.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.JCLEPRO.2015.02.004,article

Digital twin technologies can provide decisionmakers with effective tools to rapidly evaluate city resilience under projected floods. However, the development of city digital twins for flood predictions is challenging due to the time-consuming, uncertain processes of developing, calibrating, and coupling physics-based hydrologic and hydraulic models. In this study, a flood prediction methodology (FPM) that integrates synchronization analysis and deep-learning is developed to directly simulate the complex relationships between rainfall and flood characteristics, bypassing the computationally expensive hydrologic-hydraulic models, with the City of Calgary being used for demonstration. The developed FPM presents the core of data-driven digital twins that, with real-time sensor data, can rapidly provide early warnings before flood realization, as well as information about vulnerable areas—enabling city resilience planning considering different climate change scenarios.",https://doi.org/10.3390/W14223619,article

This study differs significantly from the previous studies in four ways: (i) this study uses a more comprehensive measure of ICT by computing a composite ICT index, which takes into account several ICT indicators; (ii) some existing study uses a narrow proxy of inclusive growth using the Gini index as a proxy, while others consider three patterns of economic growth dynamics (GDP growth, real, and per capita GDP). For robust analysis, we computed a composite inclusive growth index that takes into account several shared growth indicators; (iii) our model captures the heterogeneity effect of the interaction term of FDI and ICT diffusions on two groups of SSA countries, unlike the previous studies that estimated the joint impact of FDI and ICT on the whole group of countries; (iv) we contribute to the extant studies by determining the threshold level at which ICT diffusion may determine the effect of FDI on inclusive growth. Overall, empirical results show that the positive effect of FDI on inclusive growth could intensify when ICT diffusion is beyond a given threshold level, while inflation and vulnerable unemployment deteriorate inclusive growth, among others. We are of the opinion that ICTs should engage to cushion present and future environmental threats/natural catastrophes through improving geographical monitoring and concerted reaction coupled with other policy recommendations paying special attention to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) fifteen (15)—inclusive growth.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-22689-3,article

Due to these characteristics, systemic risks are overextending established risk management and create new, unsolved challenges for policymaking in risk assessment and risk governance. Their negative effects are often pervasive, impacting fields beyond the obvious primary areas of harm. This article addresses these challenges of systemic risks from different disciplinary and sectorial perspectives. It highlights the special contributions of these perspectives and approaches and provides a synthesis for an interdisciplinary understanding of systemic risks and effective governance. The main argument is that understanding systemic risks and providing good governance advice relies on an approach that integrates novel modeling tools from complexity sciences with empirical data from observations, experiments, or simulations and evidence-based insights about social and cultural response patterns revealed by quantitative (e.g., surveys) or qualitative (e.g., participatory appraisals) investigations. Systemic risks cannot be easily characterized by single numerical estimations but can be assessed by using multiple indicators and including several dynamic gradients that can be aggregated into diverse but coherent scenarios. Lastly, governance of systemic risks requires interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral cooperation, a close monitoring system, and the engagement of scientists, regulators, and stakeholders to be effective as well as socially acceptable.",https://doi.org/10.1111/RISA.13657,article

Over the last 18 years, due to its popularity, the TAM has been augmented by including various context-specific constructs to explain phenomenon in e-commerce, e-learning, e-banking, and wireless technologies besides information systems. This study, in the context of e-commerce, or more specifically the online purchase behavior, attempts to consolidate a cohort of existing constructs using the emerging tenets of Customer Value-based Theory and reinstate the parsimonious intentions of TAM. A total of 1730 questionnaires were collected from Internet users who owned a credit card. The respondents came from all the State capitals in Malaysia, including Cyberjaya, which is the smart city of the Multimedia Super Corridor in Malaysia. Out of 1730 questionnaires, 1440 formed the sample for further data analysis. Bivariate, partial correlations and stepwise multiple regression were used in this study to determine the impact of customer value. The results have shown that Perceived Customer Value is an important determinant of Online Transactions Behavior. With the presence of Perceived Customer Value, only Behavioral Intention is a significant predictor on Online Purchase Behavior. Hence, the Customer Value-Based Model is proposed to obtain a parsimonious conceptualization in predicting consumer acceptance of e-commerce transactions.",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-39229-5_18,article

Not only are the poor more likely to get TB disease, but they are also more likely to face barriers in accessing care. In addition, the economic burden of TB (loss of wages, out-of-pocket expenses for seeking care and loss of productive years of life) makes the poor people even poorer. The vision of the TB and Poverty Subgroup of the Stop TB Partnership is: ""A world where the poor and most vulnerable are protected from TB and have easy and equitable access to quality care"". As an initiative of the Stop TB Partnership, TB REACH is focussed on the poor and vulnerable. In addition to focussing on countries with per capita GNI of $2000, or less, TB REACH also welcomes applications that target poverty pockets within countries that have a per capita GNI between $2000 and $3000 and poverty pockets within the remaining high TB burden countries. TB REACH recognizes that due to socioeconomic disparities there are often well known sub-national population that live under substantially higher levels of poverty in these countries. These poverty pockets are vulnerable to TB and often face limited access to TB care. What is poverty? Poverty is the lack of basic human needs, such as clean water, nutrition, health care, education, clothing and shelter, because of the inability to afford them. In 1998 a UN Statement on poverty, signed by the heads of all UN agencies stated: ""Fundamentally, poverty is a denial of choices and opportunities, a violation of human dignity. It means lack of basic capacity to participate effectively in society. It means not having enough to feed and cloth a family, not having a school or clinic to go to, not having the land on which to grow one's food or a job to earn one's living, not having access to credit. It means insecurity, powerlessness and exclusion of individuals, households and communities. It means susceptibility to violence, and it often implies living on marginal or fragile environments, without access to clean water or sanitation"".",https://doi.org/10.1093/bmb/ldh005,article

In a broader inclusive definition, it can be described as an opportunistic concept that enhances harmony between the lives and the environment around those lives perpetually in a city by harnessing the smart technology enabling a comfortable and convenient living ecosystem paving the way towards smarter countries and the smarter planet. SCs are being implemented to combine governors, organisations, institutions, citizens, environment, and emerging technologies in a highly synergistic synchronised ecosystem in order to increase the quality of life (QoL) and enable a more sustainable future for urban life with increasing natural resource constraints. In this study, we analyse how to develop citizen- and resource-centric smarter cities based on the recent SC development initiatives with the successful use cases, future SC development plans, and many other particular SC development solutions. The main features of SC are presented in a framework fuelled by recent technological advancement, particular city requirements and dynamics. This framework - TCitySmartF 1) aims to aspire a platform that seamlessly forges engineering and technology solutions with social dynamics in a new philosophical city automation concept - socio-technical transitions, 2) incorporates many smart evolving components, best practices, and contemporary solutions into a coherent synergistic SC topology, 3) unfolds current and future opportunities in order to adopt smarter, safer and more sustainable urban environments, and 4) demonstrates a variety of insights and orchestrational directions for local governors and private sector about how to transform cities into smarter cities from the technological, social, economic and environmental point of view, particularly by both putting residents and urban dynamics at the forefront of the development with participatory planning and interaction for the robust community- and citizen-tailored services.

In the specific case of Italy, which faced political and economic distress between 2011 and 2013, “smart city” policies became one of the foundational political technologies for the implementation of austerity measures. In this paper, I analyse how the smart city provided a lexicon for urban austerity through a series of different sites and vehicles of policymaking, from practitioners to companies and other institutions. I argue that smart city discourses and practices functioned as a political technology that was effective in justifying cost containment measures and supporting the shift to pro-innovation public expenditures.

From an organizational point of view, however, the more important issue is how managers make informed decisions about interventions that can lead to greater acceptance and effective utilization of IT. There is limited research in the IT implementation literature that deals with the role of interventions to aid such managerial decision making. Particularly, there is a need to understand how various interventions can influence the known determinants of IT adoption and use. To address this gap in the literature, we draw from the vast body of research on the technology acceptance model (TAM), particularly the work on the determinants of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, and: (i) develop a comprehensive nomological network (integrated model) of the determinants of individual level (IT) adoption and use; (ii) empirically test the proposed integrated model; and (iii) present a research agenda focused on potential pre- and postimplementation interventions that can enhance employees' adoption and use of IT.

Nevertheless, there is still a gap in existing knowledge regarding representative academic literature that underlie research on TAM in educational context. The main objective of this systematic literature review is to provide an overview of the current state of research efforts on TAM application in the field of learning and teaching for a variety of learning domains, learning technologies and types of users. Through systematic search by the use of EBSCO Discovery Service, the review has identified 71 relevant studies ranged between 2003 and 2018. The main findings indicate that TAM and its many different versions represent a credible model for facilitating assessment of diverse learning technologies. TAM's core variables, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, have been proven to be antecedent factors affecting acceptance of learning with technology. The paper identifies some gaps in current work and suggests areas for further investigation. The results of this systematic review provide a better understanding of TAM acceptance studies in educational context and create a firm foundation for advancing knowledge in the field. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Technology acceptance research in teaching and learning context has become an attractive trend. A number of reviews and meta-analysis focused on specific topics related to technology acceptance in education have been conducted. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is the key model in understanding predictors of human behaviour towards potential acceptance or rejection of the technology. What this paper adds The state of current research on Technology Acceptance Model application in educational context lacks comprehensive reviews addressing variety of learning domains, learning technologies and types of users. The paper presents systematic review of relevant academic literature on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) in the field of learning and teaching. The paper provides empirical evidence on the predictive validity of the models based on TAM presented in selected literature. The findings revealed that TAM, along with its many different versions called TAM++, is a leading scientific paradigm and credible model for facilitating assessment of diverse technological deployments in educational context. TAM's core variables, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, have been proven to be antecedent factors that have affected acceptance of learning with technology. Implications for practice and/or policy The systematic review adds to the body of knowledge and creates a firm foundation for advancing knowledge in the field.

Two core dimensions of this ideology of technology in urban governance interact to consequentially reshape urban processes: (1) the priority of attracting high-technology industries as engines for urban economies and (2) the tendency to reframe urban problems into technological problems, to be addressed by technological solutions. Together, these mechanisms operate in conjunction to privilege technological needs, capacities, and priorities in urban governance, contributing to the widespread exclusion of people and problems beyond the scope of technology. Although not unprecedented, this ideology of technology has acquired renewed potency with neoliberalized urbanism, urban restructuring, and the ongoing information revolution. Furthermore, these changes intensify the ongoing transformation of cities (and space more generally) into digitized spaces tailored for capital accumulation in the context of digital and surveillance capitalism.

The Dimensions of Empowerment Theory was used to describe the various empowerment outcomes. These include economic, social, informational, political, and cultural empowerment. The findings showed barriers hindering women's utilization of telecentres included a lack of computer skills, education, language barriers, gender usage patterns, unemployment, and a lack of awareness. Our study contributes to the ICT4D/HCI gender field and suggests that ICT policymakers consider using telecentres for women empowerment.",https://doi.org/10.1080/02681102.2021.1991871,article

The article addresses this knowledge gap in an empirical investigation of three sustainability-oriented incubators in Sweden, Finland and Germany. The data are based on interviews with managers, stakeholders and tenants in Green Tech Park (Sweden), LADEC (Finland) and Green Garage (Germany). On average, the studied incubators had an ambition to recruit and develop sustainability-oriented start-ups, but the number of tenants must reach a critical mass if such ambitions are to become a reality. The local context influences this critical mass of start-ups and is a determining factor in generating (a) potential tenants and (b) the resources to support such firms. This suggests that incubator managers must actively seek tenants interested in sustainable entrepreneurship and that support must focus on activities in sustainability.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0950422216659567,article

This requires establishing service supply strategies considering citizens' satisfaction levels by identifying the factors that affect the will or behavior of citizens who use smart city services. However, decision making regarding smart city policies and service supply in Korea is conducted through the central government-centered top-down mode, which lacks the consideration of how to improve citizens' satisfaction levels or their intention to use technology. Thus, we proposed an acceptance model for smart city services, which is a theoretical model that offers a foundation for a model to evaluate the interaction levels of citizens toward smart city services based on the technology acceptance model, which is the most widely used tool to evaluate what factors affect the acceptance and use of information technology and system-based services. In addition, we defined research models by discussing previous studies that proposed factors that affect the acceptance of smart city and U-City services and urban public services. To empirically verify the research models proposed herein, we surveyed citizens in Seoul and conducted structural equation modeling using AMOS 28.

The relative effect of autoimmune-associated citrullination on the structure and thrombotic potential of fibrin(ogen) remains unknown. We therefore compared indices of vascular function, inflammation, coagulation and fibrin clot composition in RA patients with healthy controls and evaluated inter-parameter relationships. Methods Blood samples were collected from 30 RA patients and 25 age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers. Levels of SAA, CRP, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 was measured using a sandwich immunoassay. Whole blood coagulation was assessed using Thromboelastography. Fibrin clot networks and fiber structure was investigated using Scanning Electron Microscopy. The detection and quantification of citrullination in formed fibrin clots were performed using a fluorescently labeled Citrulline monoclonal antibody with Confocal Microscopy. Results Concentrations of SAA, CRP and ICAM-1 were significantly elevated in RA patients compared to controls. TEG parameters relating to coagulation initiation (R and K), rate of fibrin cross-linking ($\alpha$-Angle), and time to reach maximum thrombus generation (TMRTG) were attenuated in RA patients. Parameters relating to clot strength (MA, MRTG, TGG) did not statistically differ between RA and controls. Logistic regression modelling revealed stronger association between acute phase reactants (CRP, SAA) with TEG parameters than endothelial function markers. Microscopic analysis revealed denser networks of thicker fibrin fibers in RA patients compared to controls [median (interquartile range) 214 (170-285) vs 120 (100-144) nm respectively, p<0.0001, Odds ratio=22.7). Detection of multiple citrullinated regions within fibrin clot structures in RA patients, which was less prevalent in control samples (p<0.05, OR=2.2). Conclusion Patients with active RA display a coagulation profile that is dissimilar to general findings associated with other inflammatory conditions. The alteration of protein structures by autoimmune linked citrullination could play a role in determining the structure of fibrin and the potential of conferring a heightened thrombotic risk in RA patients. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.28.121301,article

"Baldascino, Mauro and Mosca, Michele",2016.0,{The Capability Approach and the Tools of Economic Policies for Smart City,"The capability approach developed by the Nobel Prize Amartya Sen have influenced the theoretical approaches of the studies of well-being and quality of life in a multidimensional key focusing on people's freedom. As Sen points out that approach measures the individual advantage in the reason of the capability that the person has to do those things which assign a value. In fact, the advantage of an individual in terms of opportunities is considered lower than that of another one if that individual has lower capacities – i.e. lower effective opportunities - to realize what he attributes a value. The focus is than on the effective freedom of people to do or to be what he believes is worthwhile to do or to be (Sen A., 1999). Therefore, Sen proposes an idea of well-being as “what the individual can do or can be” (set of being and doing), in relation to the ability of people to transform the means and the resources available in results, achievements and goals. A proposal that aims to overcome the concept of material well-being, limited to the unique availability of resources. Furthermore, the capability approach allows a rereading of the issue of the quality of life associated with the condition of social segregation in urban areas, namely degradation of the peripheral neighbourhoods of the city. The urban environment, being a factor capable of affecting the ability to act of people, for the presence/absence of social structures in the broadest possible sense, can be evaluated for the opportunities given to individuals to convert their resources into daily life functioning. The capabilities of people can become, therefore, a measure of the quality of urban environment, depending on the wealth of the conversion factors of the resources into the set of capability. The different multidimensional perspective, introduced by the capability approach, can decisively influence the policy choices. The development of the smart cities strategies and, more generally, the “integrated” territorial policies should propose, then, as an expansion of the devices of people capabilities, in urban areas, which could become potentially segregating and narrowing the field of opportunities to convert resources into functioning.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.SBSPRO.2016.05.306,article

Design/methodology/approach: The paper suggests a novel – the local entrepreneurial – type of smart bottom-up initiative between civil grassroots and market-based initiatives. This idea is further evolved in the paper to define the patterns of this alternative type of smart bottom-up initiative. For this purpose, the paper conducts a case study of a community-based sustainable energy and mobility system launched by a local entrepreneur in Utrecht, the Netherlands. Findings: The local entrepreneur has played a catalyzing role in public value creation by initiating and upscaling cooperative practices around smart technologies. This success has mainly been achieved due to the entrepreneurial attitudes of pioneering and risk-taking as well as the capability to bridge between the state, the market and society to accelerate urban sustainability transition. Practical implications: This paper offers a practical illustration of the potential of local entrepreneurs to evolve cooperative practices with smart technologies for societal change. It also shows the vital role of local governments in the achievement of bottom-up initiatives contributing to urban smartness. However, in the case of commercializing initiatives, governments also need to take a balancing role to safeguard the needs of all citizens based on fairness and equity, which is at the core of public value creation. Originality/value: The study adds to the citizen participation literature by revealing a novel type of active citizen grasping technological opportunities to mobilize networks to cooperate for the collective good. The research also contributes to a better understanding of the bottom-up smart city as a form of governance, and its advantages as well as drawbacks concerning public value creation.",https://doi.org/10.1108/IJPSM-02-2018-0060,article

This paper reports on one of the only large‐scale qualitative studies of the barriers to broadband adoption in the United States, where 30% of the population lack broadband access. The primary research question asks: how can we qualitatively understand barriers to broadband adoption among low‐income communities? The study's community‐based approach, undertaken in four regions of the country, reveals the complex equilibrium of broadband adoption. Drawing from 170 interviews with broadband non‐adopters as well as community access providers and other intermediaries, this study finds that price is only one factor shaping home broadband adoption, and that libraries and other community organizations fill the gap between low home adoption and high demand for broadband. These intermediaries compensate for shortages in digital skills that also constitute barriers to adoption in a context where broadband is essential for gaining access to jobs, education, and e‐government. These three main findings suggest that low‐income people like our research participants are playing roles as actors in an ecology of broadband access games (Dutton et al. 2004). In particular, they are overcoming barriers to being online in order to participate in accessing services and gaining education. This is part of the process of defining broadband as an infrastructure for e‐democracy. The paper recommends a renewed focus on factors that sustain home access rather than drive demand, as well as support for community intermediaries in provisioning public broadband access within a context of skill shortages. It recommends further qualitative research to better understand the role of diverse populations in framing the value of broadband access.",https://doi.org/10.2202/1944-2866.1058,article

Different classes of radio galaxies can be used as tracers of the cosmic environment, including the dark matter density field, to address key cosmological questions. Classifying these galaxies based on morphology is thus an important step towards achieving the science goals of next generation radio surveys. Radio galaxies have been traditionally classified as Fanaroff-Riley (FR) I and II, although some exhibit more complex 'bent' morphologies arising from environmental factors or intrinsic properties. In this work, we present the FIRST Classifier, an online system for automated classification of Compact and Extended radio sources. We developed the FIRST Classifier based on a trained deep Convolutional Neural Network model to automate the morphological classification of compact and extended radio sources observed in the FIRST radio survey. Our model achieved an overall accuracy of 97 per cent and a recall of 98 per cent, 100 per cent, 98 per cent, and 93 per cent for Compact, BENT, FRI, and FRII galaxies, respectively.

This is despite an average annual increase in energy efficiency of about 30% in ICT/electronics throughout the last 5 decades. Mainstream studies of energy-related rebound effects have yet to produce a conceptual framework that adequately encapsulates a unique feature of ICT/electronics: its tendency to induce changes in social practice and socio-technical structures. This study attempts to fill this gap. Surveying rebound effect literature, it builds on studies which explore 'transformational' change caused by energy efficiency increases. It identifies structural changes in business, education, the military and households caused by energy efficiency increases in ICT/electronics, which lead to a proliferation of ICT/electronic devices and consequently increased energy consumption. It shows the cause-and-effect logic between energy efficiency and energy consumption in ICT/electronics, and tentatively estimates rebound effects ranging between 115% and 161% in eight diverse empirical examples. The history of ICT/electronics shows that energy efficiency increases inevitably lead to increases in energy consumption, hence firm controls on CO2e emission allowances may offer the best hope of curbing energy consumption and CO2e emissions in this sector.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.ECOLECON.2015.08.020,article

The shift not only marks the optimization and upgrading of the economic structure, but also reflects the in-depth implementation of the concept of sustainable development. In this context, the development of AI technology is playing an important role in balancing economic growth and ecological protection with its unique advantages. This paper empirically studied the impact of AI development on urban energy efficiency by constructing panel data for 282 prefecture-level cities from 2006 to 2019 and then using the super-efficiency SBM model based on non-expected outputs to evaluate the urban energy efficiency indicators of prefecture-level cities. It was discovered that the development of AI had a key influence on increasing urban energy efficiency and the optimization of the energy structure by speeding up green technology innovation and digital economy development, which in turn improved urban energy efficiency. In terms of heterogeneity analysis, AI development had a greater impact on urban energy efficiency in the eastern region, which has higher levels of human capital, financial independence, and government intervention. This study combined the smart city pilot policy with a multi-period DID model, based on the treatment of endogeneity issues, in order to perform a parallel trend test and investigate further the effects of policy implementation on the advancement of AI in the context of improving urban energy efficiency. Accordingly, to achieve green and sustainable urban development, the relevant government departments should increase funding for AI research and development, pay attention to the introduction and cultivation of professionals, establish a platform for international exchanges and cooperation between AI and energy management, and continue to advocate for the pilot development of smart cities to increase urban energy efficiency.",https://doi.org/10.3390/SU16083200,article

The global outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 further highlighted the important role of e-Health and m-Health service modes. This research structures a mediated effect model to explore dynamic relationships between ICT factors, ICT impacts, and national health outcomes, among which ICT factors are independent variables; ICT impacts are mediating variables, and national health outcome indicators selected from United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and World Development Indicators are dependent variables. The fixed effect model is used to process a set of 141 countries' panel data from 2012 to 2016 from World Bank and World Economic Forum, while the classical three-step test method and Sobel test combined with fixed effects are used to test the mediated effects of the panel data. The results show that there are significant associations between ICT factors and national health outcome indicators, while only some of the partial mediated effects are proved. ICT environment and ICT usage can influence both the under-five mortality rate and adolescent fertility rate via ICT social impact. However, the mediated effect of ICT social impact on maternal mortality ratio and life expectancy at birth has not been confirmed. Meanwhile, the mediated effect of ICT economic impact has not been proven.

As one of the prevalent ICT visions or computing paradigms, the IoT is associated with big data analytics, which is clearly on a penetrative path across many urban domains for optimizing energy efficiency and mitigating environmental effects. This pertains mainly to the effective utilization of natural resources, the intelligent management of infrastructures and facilities, and the enhanced delivery of services in support of the environment. As such, the IoT and related big data applications can play a key role in catalyzing and improving the process of environmentally sustainable development. However, topical studies tend to deal largely with the IoT and related big data applications in connection with economic growth and the quality of life in the realm of smart cities, and largely ignore their role in improving environmental sustainability in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. In addition, several advanced technologies are being used in smart cities without making any contribution to environmental sustainability, and the strategies through which sustainable cities can be achieved fall short in considering advanced technologies. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to review and synthesize the relevant literature with the objective of identifying and discussing the state-of-the-art sensor-based big data applications enabled by the IoT for environmental sustainability and related data processing platforms and computing models in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. Also, this paper identifies the key challenges pertaining to the IoT and big data analytics, as well as discusses some of the associated open issues. Furthermore, it explores the opportunity of augmenting the informational landscape of smart sustainable cities with big data applications to achieve the required level of environmental sustainability. In doing so, it proposes a framework which brings together a large number of previous studies on smart cities and sustainable cities, including research directed at a more conceptual, analytical, and overarching level, as well as research on specific technologies and their novel applications. The goal of this study suits a mix of two research approaches: topical literature review and thematic analysis. In terms of originality, no study has been conducted on the IoT and related big data applications in the context of smart sustainable cities, and this paper provides a basis for urban researchers to draw on this analytical framework in future research. The proposed framework, which can be replicated, tested, and evaluated in empirical research, will add additional depth to studies in the field of smart sustainable cities.

The bone is dated approximately 20,000BC.Key to the demonstration of the sieve is the contention that the ancient Stone Agemathematicians of Ishango in Central Africa conceived of doubling or multiplication by 2in a more primitive mode than modern Computer Age humans, as the process of""copying"" of a singular record (that is, a mark created by a stone tool as encountered inStone Age people's daily experience). Similarly, the doubling of any number was, bylogical extension, a process of copying of any number of records (marks) denoting aninteger, thereby doubling the exhibited number (marks). Some evidence for this processof ""copying"" and thus representing numbers as consisting of ""copies"" of other numbers,is displayed on the bone and can still be found to exist in the number systems ofmodern Africans in the region.Unlike previous speculations on the use of the bone tool by other studies, the ancientmethod of sieving of the small primes suggested here is notable for unifying (making useand explanation of) all columns of the Ishango bone; whilst all numbers exhibited forman essential part of the primitive mathematical sieve described. Furthermore, it is statedthat the middle column (M) of the bone inscriptions houses the calculations of theIshango Sieve. All numbers deduced in the middle calculation column relate to aprocess of elimination of the non-prime numbers from the sequence of numbers1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 (although numbers 1 and 2 are omitted).

A.",2011.0,{The Metacity: A Conceptual Framework for Integrating Ecology and Urban Design,"We introduce the term metacity as a conceptual framework that can be shared by ecologists and designers and applied across the wide variety of urban habitats found around the world. While the term metacity was introduced by UN-HABITAT to designate hyper cities of over twenty million people, for us it is not limited to large urban agglomerations, but rather refers to the proliferation of new forms of urbanization, each with distinct ecological and social attributes. These various urban configurations when combined with new digital sensing, communication and social networking technologies constitute a virtual meta-infrastructure, present in all cities today. This new metacity has the potential to integrate new activist forms of ecological and urban design research and practice in making the transition from sanitary to sustainable city models globally. The city of Baltimore, Maryland will be used both as a site to illustrate these recent urban trends, and also as an example of the integration of ecology and urban design pursued by the two authors over the past seven years [1,2]. Metacity theory is drawn from both an architectural analysis of contemporary forms of urbanism, new forms of digital monitoring and communication technologies, as well as metapopulation and metacommunity theories in ecology.

The establishment of Smart City initiatives in African cities is meant to improve the quality of lives of the residents of those cities. Information and communications technologies (ICT) are key enabling factors for this transformation and must be integrated into several functional domains of society, such as health, education, transportation, energy, etc., so as to engender efficient and ubiquitous public services, as well as higher socio-economic standards of living for the citizens. This paper highlights the potential benefits, as well as challenges, African cities embarking on Smart City initiatives face. To further grasp the motivations and challenges of implementing Smart City initiatives in Africa, we take a look at a new Smart City initiative (The SmartCity Innovation Hub, by Smart City Resort plc.) that is underway in the city of Lagos, Nigeria.

The need for rapid action and decision-making is a challenge for inclusivity and quality of deliberation. Additionally, policy responses to the virus need to be even more co-ordinated than usual, which intensifies their complexity. The digitalisation of the public sphere may be seen as a further challenge to deliberating.

Given the accelerated global reliance on technology resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the author conducted a state-of-the-art literature review to identify emerging issues and highlight research needs in this area. A search of 10 databases yielded 39 studies spanning the major resettlement regions (North America, Western Europe, Oceania) and including refugees from across the globe. The inclusion criteria were studies focused on refugees' practical use of digital technology in integration, published from January 2020-April 2021. Exclusion criteria were studies on refugees in transit or protracted displacement, digital connectivity and accessibility, use of digital technology by humanitarian actors, software development, analyses of digital representations of refugees, public attitudes toward refugees as expressed in digital media, and literature reviews. Ndofor-Tah et al.'s (2019) Refugee Integration Framework was used to organize and synthesize the findings. The studies demonstrated how digital skills affect all domains of integration. Additionally, the studies confirm that many refugees in resettlement have limited digital skills for necessary integration tasks, such as navigating websites and assessing the credibility of online information. Limitations of this state-of-the-art review include its cross-sectional nature, having only one reviewer, and only published literature accessible online through public websites or subscription databases. An important emerging issue for future research is assessing, teaching, and learning digital skills among this population.

We examine how youth understand the impact of digital technologies on urban transformations and whether their technology skills and digital literacy give them a sense of ownership over the future of their city. Research was conducted within the context of a six-week summer educational program involving seventy-nine youth of color from public high schools in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The program mixed digital skill building with urban fieldwork to prototype solutions to long-standing urban problems: the sort of problems that smart city policies also seek to change. Our research points to a conundrum for youth. Although they embraced technological innovations, they indicated that digital technologies failed to serve the public or address pressing concerns they identified as problematic within the city: crime, drugs, and homelessness. Instead, in their view, digital technologies delivered the most benefit to private spaces in the home and workplace. Furthermore, the youth did not envision that emergent technologies would improve their neighborhoods or communities but only their employment prospects. This research suggests that the emergent smart city is reproducing actual as well as perceived urban inequities: Wealthy residential neighborhoods and spaces of the new economy become “smart,” but much of the city remains left behind. These patterns create a paradox for youth who invest in digital skills while remaining on the margins of technology-driven, smart urban change.

The Smart City encapsulates all the desires and prospects on the transformative and disruptive role technology will have in solving urban issues both in Global North and Global South cities. Critical scholarship has pointed out that private capital, with the blessing of technocratic elites, has found a techno-environmental fix to both reshuffle economic growth and prevent other alternative politico-ecological transitions to take root in urban systems. Against this bleak outlook, the paper argues that these technological assemblages might be compatible with alternative post-capitalist urban transformations aligned with Degrowth. Through a cross-reading of research on Smart Cities with theoretical perspectives drawn from the literature on Degrowth, I suggest that Degrowth should not refrain from engaging with urban technological imaginaries in a critical and selective way.

In Mumbai there is an alliance between SPARC, Mahila Milan (""Women Toegether"", a Muslim women's pavement dewellers association) and the National Slum Dwellers Federation. The alliance works in different areas such as community-based savings and credit groups, pilot projects, housing construction, the development of toilet blocks and the management of resettlement, all aiming at poverty reduction. Sparc was founded in 1984 and worked together with Mahila Milan. It is obvious that pavement dwellers experience continuous insecurity, including eviction, police harassment and obtaining water and ration cards. People lack a secure home. The initiative therefore aimed at developing housing and saving strategies to cope with insecurity. In 1986/88 an alliance was formed with the National Slum Dwellers Federation. The alliance's core activities are as follows: (1) Forming savings and credit groups - capital funds to cope with crisis. Savings groups can transform savers' relations with reach other and with their families and the community. There are now hundreds of thousands of households with access to security loans and 25,000 households saving for housing. (2) House building: getting a piece of secured land and build permanent collectiv etenure (here 5,000 borrowers are involved). (3) A constantly expanding learning cycle through pilot projects (4) Community exchange (5) Building community toilet blocks (6) Resettlement. The article concluded that solutions emerging from the urban poor best serve their needs. However, community exchange has to be strenghened. The article emphasizes that the urban poor do not so much lack capital rather than security. As communities secure land, they are eager to build. During the 1990s three different houding cooperatives were able to obtain land at Dharavi, Mankhurd and Dindoshi in Mumbai. Financing for housing loans was available. The Slum Redevelopment Act allows low-income high-density settlements to be redeveloped at higher than usual densities (6). Box 2 (11f.) describes the thrift and credit program of Mahila Milan. SPARC has the premise that the poor already use strategies that are probably most effective. Nevertheless, these can be improved. Hence SPARC and the alliance support the refinement of these strategies and then demonstrate them to the city officials (15). SPARC believes that there can be no social change supporting the poor if they are not participating in designing, managing and realizing this process of change. How do communities participate? SPARC distinghishes different ways: Participation already takes place when a development intervention begins in your neigbourhood. Your and your neighbors' presence causes this intervention. A stronger participation takes place if you do not say ""no"". This means planners consider you to have participated and said ""yes"". Another, even higher level of participation is when somebody convinces or persuades you to participate. The highest level is when you feel you have to participate and use your voice option (15-16). The Allicance believes ""that effective participation requires that an individual, group or community can make a choice to become involved in a given process or activity, can understand the options that the particular process opens up, and can understand the impact that the process will have upon their lives, their households, their community and their environment"" (16). Poverty means for the people that for the most part there is either no choice or the range of choice is very limited. ""Poor people's lives operate within very narrow confines, where choices are jew and where looking for other options means taking risks whihc may destroy or damage precarious survival strategies, should they fail. The routines that poor families follow reflect a tenuous balance between managing their own survival and managaing the (almost feudal) relationships of dependency and patronage that enable that survival"" (16). Poor people are very cautious: not to offend to leaders, police, etc. and sommining tremendous resources to stay alive. If being passive helps one to survive then people conceil their own ideas or even drop them by just only reacting in such a way not to become into the focus. On the other hand, people have a local knowledge, can draw upon their collective wisdom, can take what is appropriate and drop what does not fit. Networking is important to keep this collective wisdom alive and help it to increase. SPARC and the Alliance aim at increasing the options of poor people and their communities. The federation may serve as a basis for exchange (18). Urban poor need opportunities to use their own resources and manage them according to their own advantage. Urban poor can save: they only need appropriate schemes, and on the basis of these they also may obtain loans; and they can invest: if they have a certain security that they are not demolished. Recent legislation has combined the right to stay in low-income, high-density settlements such as Dharavi with the right to develop housing at higher densities than elsewhere in the city (21). ""The development strategy used by SPARC and groups like them is very different from common conceptualizations of how to ""do"" development. For many years, there were few tangible outputs. This was not a project-based pproach with a list of water taps, sanitation lines, houses built and community organizations formed. The objective, from the beginning, was to transform institutions, both those at the community level and those in local government, and to transform the interaction between the state and the urban poor. Inevitably, this required substantial investment in community learning and federating"" (22).",,article
"Nyers, Peter",2006.0,{The accidental citizen: Acts of sovereignty and (un)making citizenship,"How are citizens and foreigners made and unmade? This article addresses this question by taking Paul Virilio's recent theorizing on the accident as its point of departure. Virilio rethinks the received wisdom that says that the accident is solely that which is unexpected and contingent. According to Virilio, the invention or production of any technology is simultaneously also the production of its accident. To invent the train, he says, is to invent derailment; to invent aircraft is to invent the air crash. Technologies, therefore, can be assessed on the basis of the accidents they produce. In this article, I shift the focus of theories of the accident to the topic of citizenship. What is the primary accident of technologies of citizenship? What exclusions are enabled when the 'accident' is employed as a political category? These questions are addressed through an analysis of the discourse on 'accidental citizenship' in the United States. Accidental citizenship is a pejorative way of describing the 'birthright' citizenship of individuals who were born on US territory to non-citizen parents. I argue with reference to the case of the so-called 'second American Taliban' (Yaser Esam Hamdi) that the discourse of 'accidental citizenship' is being employed as a strategy for making and unmaking American citizenship. Accidental citizenship involves discursive technologies that enable an exceptional logic to be applied to legally normalized subjects, with the effect of excluding those who are included. Consequently, by focusing on the figure of the 'accidental citizen' in post-9/11 United States we can better understand the acts of sovereignty by which citizens and foreigners, friends and enemies are made and unmade.

The results revealed that the project managers perceived different needs and goals within the context of smart city innovation and realization. The project managers perception of smart city was mainly within a smart economy and smart governance perspective. However, the project managers also criticized the relatively less focus on public participations and dialogue-oriented smart city solutions.

"Shen, Li Yin and {Jorge Ochoa",2011.0,{The application of urban sustainability indicators - A comparison between various practices,"Urban population has been increasing and it is estimated to reach 70% of the total population in the world by 2050. Governments are facing greater challenges every time in providing inhabitants with a good quality of life in their cities. Many cities around the world have developed sustainable urban development plans for leading their urbanization process towards a desired status of urban sustainability. Urban sustainability indicators have been selected as main elements for communicating the status of the practice, which help to determine how successful strategies and policies enforced have been in the attainment of sustainability goals. Different practices use different indicators according to their particular needs, and these have been selected under different methods. However, whilst there are cases where urban sustainability indicators are effectively in use, the experiences gained from each practice have not been shared and used for the development of new urban development plans and for improving the decision-making process in the selection of indicators. This paper examines 9 different practices and proposes a comparative basis, namely, International Urban Sustainability Indicators List (IUSIL), for allowing the better understanding of drivers and goals of each practice and identifying under what circumstances various practices selected their indicators. Discussions made on the comparative analysis are categorized in four different dimensions: environmental, economic, social and governance. Research results show how comparative basis can lead to knowledge sharing between different practices, which can be used to guide the selection of indicators of sustainable urbanization plans and improve the effective communication of the status of practices. The study not only reveals how different indicators are selected but also suggests the need for consistent processes of choosing indicators based on the benchmarks obtained from best practices. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.HABITATINT.2010.03.006,article

They represent environments that enable superior cognitive capabilities and creativity to be collectively constructed from combinations of individual cognitive skills and information systems that operate in the physical, institutional, and digital spaces of cities. Two academic traditions have been feeding the discussion concerning intelligent communities and cities: the literature on innovative environments and the planning of digital cities. Following an introduction on the meaning of ICs, we discuss the structuring of innovative environments such as clusters, technology districts and territorial systems of innovation, which rely on different architectures of knowledge networks enhancing product, process, and organizational innovation. Then we turn to digital cities and examine their concept, architecture, and constituent elements. In the final section of the paper we describe intelligent cities as overlapping of innovative clusters and digital cities. Intelligent cities integrate knowledge-intensive activities and clusters; embedded routines of social cooperation enabling knowledge sharing and innovation; advanced communication infrastructure and digital spaces for knowledge and innovation management; and proven ability to innovate and resolve problems that appear for the first time, since the capacity to innovate and manage uncertainty are critical factors in characterizing intelligence.",https://doi.org/10.1049/CP:20060620,article

Much more than a technical and practical issue, the digital city has dimensions that are social, cultural, political, ideological, and of course also theoretical. I explore these broader conceptual underpinnings of the digital city idea. More specifically: where do urban ideologies, urban structures and functions, and digital urban representations meet? How may the digital city relate to the real city? On the basis of what choices might the digital city be constructed? What might the digital city mean to people? To be answered, these highly involved and interrelated questions require a coherent conceptual framework. By considering an overview of digital-city realizations, issues, and critiques, I adumbrate a theory of the digital city, seen as lying at the intersection of three domains: a physical urban area, the communities of people associated with that area, and the possibilities and constraints (technological, but also socioeconomic and ideological) of the evolving information society. A rough sketch is all that can be offered at this point because proper theories of the digital city cannot be developed independently of comprehensive theories of the real 21st-century city.

Neighbourhood open spaces, and green spaces in particular, provide opportunities for social interactions that may help the residents to establish recognition and develop relationships. This paper investigates the contribution of local parks to the development of social ties in inner-city neighbourhoods. Combining quantitative methods (questionnaire survey) with a qualitative approach (focus group discussions), the research was carried out in three inner-city neighbourhoods in Greater Manchester, UK, characterised by different levels of material deprivation and ethnic diversity. The social survey explored the associations between the respondents' visits to local parks and the number of friends and acquaintances they had. The findings suggest that local parks may support the development of social ties in inner-city areas. Associations were found between the quality of the parks, the character of visits, and the extent of social ties in the neighbourhood. The study concludes that for inner-city parks to realise their full potential in supporting social interactions and developing social ties, they need to be well-maintained and provide good recreational facilities. The development of social ties was also found to be considerably affected by the characteristics of the individuals and the neighbourhood. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.LANDURBPLAN.2012.05.007,article

Despite many previous studies of older adults' Internet use, none focused on these most vulnerable older adults. Objective: This study examined Internet use patterns, reasons for discontinued use, eHealth literacy, and attitudes toward computer/Internet use among low-income homebound individuals aged 60 and older in comparison to their younger counterparts-homebound adults under age 60. Methods: Face-to-face or telephone surveys were conducted with 980 recipients of home-delivered meals in central Texas (78% were age 60 years and older and 22% under age 60). The eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) and the efficacy and interest subscales of the Attitudes Toward Computer/Internet Questionnaire (ATC/IQ) were used to measure the respective constructs. Age groups were compared with chi-square tests and t tests. Correlates of Internet use were analyzed with multinomial logistic regression, and correlates of eHEALS and ATC/IQ scores were analyzed with OLS regression models. Results: Only 34% of the under-60 group and 17% of the 60 years and older group currently used the Internet, and 35% and 16% of the respective group members reported discontinuing Internet use due to cost and disability. In addition to being older, never users were more likely to be black (OR 4.41; 95% CI 2.82-6.91, P<.001) or Hispanic (OR 4.69; 95% CI 2.61-8.44, P<.001), and to have lower incomes (OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.27-0.49, P<.001). Discontinued users were also more likely to be black or Hispanic and to have lower incomes. Among both age groups, approximately three-fourths of the current users used the Internet every day or every few days, and their eHEALS scores were negatively associated with age and positively associated with frequency of use. Among the 60 and older group, a depression diagnosis was also negatively associated with eHEALS scores. ATC/IQ efficacy among never users of all ages and among older adults was positively associated with living alone, income, and the number of medical conditions and inversely associated with age, Hispanic ethnicity, and Spanish as the primary language. Although ATC/IQ interest among older adults was also inversely associated with age, it was not associated with Hispanic ethnicity and Spanish as the primary language. Conclusions: This study is the first to describe in detail low-income disabled and homebound adults' and older adults' Internet use.

Botri{\'{c,2021.0,{The digital divide and E-government in European economies,"Even though the Internet usage is perceived to be widespread, senior citizens are relatively more reluctant to adopt new technologies. By relying on the Eurostat's Community Statistics on Information Society (CSIS) microdata for the period 2008–2017, we explore recent evolution of the digital divide across Europe. We analyse the difference in adoption of e-governance by younger and older Internet users as well as their reasons for not using e-government services (specifically by submitting completed forms to public authorities). Additionally, we seek to identify factors that determine the difference in the reluctance to adopt e-governance services by senior citizens and the young. By adopting Heckman selection methodology, we establish three categories of factors: those that have different effects for young and old (gender, household size, and population density), those having similar effects (economic activity), and those that have adverse effects for the young and the old (education). Based on empirical results, we suggest following venues for EU-wide policy actions: special attention should be given to older population in sparsely populated areas, specialised learning activities should be developed for older citizens with additional effort to promote inclusion of older women to participate in these learning activities.",https://doi.org/10.1080/1331677X.2020.1863828,article

To explain this finding, we investigated what these people are doing online. The first contribution is a theoretically validated cluster of Internet usage types: information, news, personal development, social interaction, leisure, commercial transaction and gaming. The second contribution is that, based on this classification, we were able to identify a number of usage differences, including those demonstrated by people with different gender, age, education and Internet experience, that are often observed in digital divide literature. The general conclusion is that when the Internet matures, it will increasingly reflect known social, economic and cultural relationships of the offline world, including inequalities. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444813487959,article

It uniquely identifies the factors affecting the digital divide that have emerged in recent years (2017–2021) as well as investigate if there are new forms or levels of the divide that have surfaced in recent literature. The findings, based on 50 included studies, show that the factors affecting the digital divide can be classified into three different segments and nine main categories: sociodemographic, socioeconomic, personal elements, social support, type of technology, digital training, rights, infrastructure, and large-scale events. Out of all factors, education has been linked to the digital divide the most. The majority of recent literature have studied Level 2 of the divide. Also, only one article in the sample has considered the digital divide at the firm level. Findings also show that a new form, type-of-internet access, and two potential new levels of the digital divide, algorithmic awareness and data inequalities, have been identified in the contemporary literature. The results contribute to the understanding and development of the different perspectives of the digital divide concept. They also contribute to the stream of literature on the determinants of the divide and to the social inequalities and digital inclusion literature.

An overview of research published in the last 20 years draws to the conclusion that females are at a disadvantage relative to men when learning about computers or learning other material with the aid of computer-assisted software. The evidence shows that the digital divide affects people of all ages and across international boundaries. We suggest that the digital divide is fundamentally a problem of computer anxiety whose roots are deep in socialization patterns of boys and girls and that interact with the stereotype of computers as toys for boys. A model of the digital divide is presented that examines gender stereotypes, attribution patterns, and stereotype threat as antecedents of computer anxiety. Computer anxiety in turn leads to differences in computer attitudes and computer performance. A number of suggestions are offered to reduce the impact of the digital divide. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1365-2729.2006.00185.X,article

In this paper, a state of the art of research studies that dealt with the three levels of the digital divide and highlight its shortcomings in light of COVID-19 are presented. Design/methodology/approach: An integrative literature review was conducted, summarizing the rich literature on the digital divide by presenting its key concepts and findings. This study then provides suggestions for future research in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: It can be concluded that the digital divide is insufficiently exposed and examined by researchers. In fact, in recent years, very few research studies have focused on the first-level divide. Moreover, much of the literature has analyzed the second digital divide (in terms of e-skills) in the strict sense and at the national level. This review also shows that the existing studies on the third level-digital divide deal only with the individual results of using the Internet. Finally, future research on the three-level digital divide should study more digital inequality related to emerging technologies is proposed. Research limitations/implications: This paper draws up a state of art, which has important theoretical and practical implications in the effectiveness of full transformation to digitalization. Originality/value: The present study contributes to digital inequality research by summarizing key concepts and findings from the literature of the three levels of the digital divide. It highlights the unexplored research topics on some dimensions of DD which were behind the digital transformation failure in many countries and provides insights on future research directions in light of COVID-19.",https://doi.org/10.1108/GKMC-06-2020-0075,article

This paper seeks to address this gap by examining the emergence of new forms of postcolonial citizenship at the intersection of digital and urban publics. In particular, I investigate the production of a “smart citizen” in India's 100 smart cities challenge – a state-run inter-urban competition that seeks to transform 100 existing cities through ICT-driven urbanism. By examining the publicly available documents and online citizen consultations as well as observations of stakeholder workshops in four of the proposed smart cities, I illustrate how a global technocratic imaginary of “smart citizenship” exists alongside its vernacular translation of a “chatur citizen” – a politically engaged citizen rooted in multiple publics and spatialities. This takes place through three key processes – enumerations, performances and breaches. Enumerations are coercions by the state of an urban population that has so far been largely hidden from analogue technologies of governance and governmentality. Articulations are the performances of smart citizenship across digital and material domains that ironically extend historic social inequalities from the urban to the digital realm. Finally, breaches are the ruptures of the impenetrable technocratic walls around the global smart city, which provides a window into alternative and possible futures of postcolonial citizenship in India. Through these three processes, I argue that subaltern citizenship in the postcolony exists not in opposition, but across urban and digital citizenships. I conclude by offering the potential of a future postcolonial citizen who opens up entangled performances of compliance and connivance, authority and insecurity, visibility and indiscernibility across political, social, urban and digital publics.",https://doi.org/10.1111/TRAN.12225,article

The results of the exploratory factor analysis arising from a survey of 299 learners revealed that from their perspective, there were seven dimensions in evaluating the e-learning quality: Interaction, Staff Support, Institutional Quality Assurance Mechanism, Institutional Credibility, Learner Support, Information and Publicity and Learning Tasks. And the confirmatory factor analysis with responses obtained from another set of 496 adult learners confirmed a good fit of the seven-factor model to the observed data. While most of these seven dimensions are supported by previous studies, some dimensions, such as technology support, content and evaluation/assessment that e-learning providers had highlighted did not appear to be important for Korean adult learners. Possible explanations for these findings are discussed in relation to learner characteristics, e-learning design, and culture, and further research topics are suggested. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1007/S11423-010-9171-4,article
"Dobransky, Kerry and Hargittai, Eszter",2006.0,{The disability divide in internet access and use,"The increasing spread of the Internet holds much potential for enhancing opportunities for people with disabilities. However, scarce evidence exists to suggest that people with disabilities are, in fact, participating in these new developments. Will the spread of information technologies (IT) increase equality by offering opportunities for people with disabilities? Or will a growing reliance on IT lead to more inequality by leaving behind certain portions of the population including people with disabilities? In this paper, the authors draw on nationally representative data regarding Americans' Internet uses to (1) identify the extent to which people with disabilities are embracing use of the Internet; (2) how their use of the Internet compares with the Internet uses of the rest of the population; (3) how having a disability relates to and interacts with other social statuses (e.g. socioeconomic status, age, gender) with regard to Internet use; and (4) what explains these trends. They draw on representative data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census of the United States to answer these questions. It is found that people with disabilities are less likely to live in households with computers, are less likely to use computers and are less likely to be online. However, once socioeconomic background is controlled for, it is found that people with hearing disabilities and those who have limited walking ability are not less likely to be Internet users. This research enables a deeper understanding of both the use of the Internet by people with disabilities and the spread of new IT more generally.",https://doi.org/10.1080/13691180600751298,article

After the advent of new innovation there are new technologies which have emerged in business and it also substantially changed consumer behavior. Digital communication allows the user to transfer data from one end to another using digital technologies like e-mail, phone calls, video conferencing, and several instant message applications. Digital communication allows retailers to send personalized business information to their loyal customers and the customers respond to those messages, which in turn generate business for unorganized retailers. Digital communication not only improves the business of unorganized retailers but also the business image, Geographical spread, profitability, new customer acquisition, customer retention, and the like. Digital communication will transform the traditional unorganized retailer into an offline-to-online commerce model. Based on theoretical review this study identified constructs and proposed major determinants which influence technology adoption and its continuance among the unorganized retailers. This study assesses the digital communication technology usage in supply chain management among unorganized retailers with the constructs like experience, effortlessness, efficiency, enrichment, trust, security, digital infrastructure, satisfaction, and continuous intention to use. The results show that digital communication technology's effort, experience, and efficiency influence satisfaction. However, enrichment failed to influence satisfaction. Further, the results show that satisfaction and security influence continuous intention to use. However, trust and digital infrastructure failed to influence.

Exploring the influence of smart city pilot policies on urban innovation performance is critical for achieving high-quality economic development and creating an innovation-driven country. This study views the experimental smart city policy in China as a quasi-natural experiment and assesses the improved influence of smart city development on urban innovation performance by constructing a multiple period difference-in-differences (DID) model, then confirms it using a variety of robustness test methodologies. The results show that urban innovation performance benefits from the construction of smart cities, and the promotion effect is sustainable. The level of economic development and information infrastructure, as well as the financial innovation expenditure, have a beneficial effect in encouraging smart city construction innovation performance, while the degree of opening-up hinders the improvement of smart city urban innovation performance. In addition, it is also found that there is heterogeneity in the promotion effect of smart city building on urban innovation performance.

This systematic review aimed to determine the effectiveness of mHealth interventions on behavioural lifestyle changes and medication adherence for cardiovascular disease self-management. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted from inception through to 3 March 2015 using MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library. Eligible studies used an experimental trial design to determine the effectiveness of an mHealth intervention to change lifestyle behaviours in any cardiovascular disease population. Data extracted included intervention and comparison group characteristics with a specific focus on the use of behaviour change techniques. Results Seven studies met our inclusion criteria and were included in the qualitative synthesis. All interventions were delivered in part by mobile phone text messaging. Three studies were effective at improving adherence to medication and two studies increased physical activity behaviour. No effects were observed on dietary behaviour or smoking cessation, measured in one study each. Simple text messaging interventions appeared to be most effective; however, no clear relationships were found between study findings and intervention dose, duration or behaviour change techniques targeted. Conclusions Our review found mHealth has the potential to change lifestyle behaviour. Results are still limited to a small number of trials, inconsistent outcome measures and ineffective reporting of intervention characteristics.

There is a statistically significant relationship between trust and use of a local government Web site, as well as other positive assessments of federal and local governments. The evidence suggests that e-government can increase process-based trust by improving interactions with citizens and perceptions of responsiveness. The findings are theoretically important for reconciling the conflicting research on the effects of e-government and for understanding variations by level of government.

Aided by location-aware technology, the game fosters the serendipitous discovery of points of interest, historical images and stories, whilst players wander the city. This exploration differs from the typical precalculated path recommendations used by other location-based applications. It triggers reflection about the city's past that is as unique as its visitors. Ours is one of the first studies to attempt an understanding of the effects of serendipitous urban discovery and historic reflection-triggering technologies on user experience. We combined field trials with controlled experiments, analysing perceptions of the experience and value using responses expressed in open-ended questionnaire items. Using thematic coding and sentiment analysis, we observed types of emotional responses, indicating four potential profiles of their likelihood towards future technology adoption. Enthusiastic and Interested users appreciated the freedom of movement choice that created an autonomous experience that fostered a sense of personal accomplishment. The interface interactions of the game, designed to stimulate reflection, supported a feeling of connectedness to others. In contrast, Cynical and Sceptical users were less tolerant of perceived technological issues, requiring more perfection in functionality and design. These users are less likely to be the early adopters of serendipitous location-based apps. The game was developed as part of a large cultural informatics project but, unlike typical evaluations, we conducted this study midway through the project and not at its end. This approach (1) gave the team the possibility to take stock, pause, and reflect and (2) provided insight on future design improvements for increasing the perceived value of serendipitous urban discovery applications.

"Naslund, J. A. and Aschbrenner, K. A. and Marsch, L. A. and Bartels, S. J.",2016.0,{The future of mental health care: Peer-To-peer support and social media,"Aims: People with serious mental illness are increasingly turning to popular social media, including Facebook, Twitter or YouTube, to share their illness experiences or seek advice from others with similar health conditions. This emerging form of unsolicited communication among self-forming online communities of patients and individuals with diverse health concerns is referred to as peer-To-peer support. We offer a perspective on how online peer-To-peer connections among people with serious mental illness could advance efforts to promote mental and physical wellbeing in this group. Methods: In this commentary, we take the perspective that when an individual with serious mental illness decides to connect with similar others online it represents a critical point in their illness experience. We propose a conceptual model to illustrate how online peer-To-peer connections may afford opportunities for individuals with serious mental illness to challenge stigma, increase consumer activation and access online interventions for mental and physical wellbeing. Results: People with serious mental illness report benefits from interacting with peers online from greater social connectedness, feelings of group belonging and by sharing personal stories and strategies for coping with day-To-day challenges of living with a mental illness. Within online communities, individuals with serious mental illness could challenge stigma through personal empowerment and providing hope. By learning from peers online, these individuals may gain insight about important health care decisions, which could promote mental health care seeking behaviours. These individuals could also access interventions for mental and physical wellbeing delivered through social media that could incorporate mutual support between peers, help promote treatment engagement and reach a wider demographic. Unforeseen risks may include exposure to misleading information, facing hostile or derogatory comments from others, or feeling more uncertain about one's health condition. However, given the evidence to date, the benefits of online peer-To-peer support appear to outweigh the potential risks. Conclusion: Future research must explore these opportunities to support and empower people with serious mental illness through online peer networks while carefully considering potential risks that may arise from online peer-To-peer interactions. Efforts will also need to address methodological challenges in the form of evaluating interventions delivered through social media and collecting objective mental and physical health outcome measures online. A key challenge will be to determine whether skills learned from peers in online networks translate into tangible and meaningful improvements in recovery, employment, or mental and physical wellbeing in the offline world.",https://doi.org/10.1017/S2045796015001067,article

Built on an integrative review of the literature, this study offers insights into the potential of smart cities and connected communities in facilitating waste management efforts. Shortcomings of existing waste management practices are highlighted and a conceptual framework for a centralized waste management system is proposed, where three interconnected elements are discussed: (1) an infrastructure for proper collection of product lifecycle data to facilitate full visibility throughout the entire lifespan of a product, (2) a set of new business models relied on product lifecycle data to prevent waste generation, and (3) an intelligent sensor-based infrastructure for proper upstream waste separation and on-time collection. The proposed framework highlights the value of product lifecycle data in reducing waste and enhancing waste recovery and the need for connecting waste management practices to the whole product life-cycle.

Yet, they will have a huge influence on economies and societies. Governments across the world are trying to develop a whole-of-society approach to digital literacy and skills to accelerate their inclusive digital transformation, ensure sustainable and inclusive economic growth and equip their citizens with the competencies needed to respond to future challenges. China, the US and the EU each take different approaches to digital skills and literacy at home and pair them with different global engagement strategies. This paper explores the way forward for digital skills in Africa, drawing on the examples of Rwanda, Senegal and South Africa. Africa's demand for investment in digital skills and literacy is particularly high because of its rapid demographic growth and wide digital divide. But, as the continent plays catch-up with major digital powers, it is vulnerable to harms such as online disinformation, cybercrime, data breaches and digital surveillance driven by commercial and state interests. Despite the growing threats that digital technologies present for individuals and societies, African governments have mainly focused on hard skills, while less effort and resources have been invested in soft skills (eg. media literacy, ability to navigate government e-services, social skills to behave online, et cetera), which are key to navigate the internet safely and responsibly. This paper argues that African governments do not need to reinvent the wheel to develop comprehensive digital literacy frameworks and policies. The EU-whose approach to digital literacy articulated in its DigComp Framework combines both economic and citizenship aspects-can be a key partner.",,techreport

This multibillion-dollar industry does not respect geopolitical borders, and threatens public health in both rich and resource-poor nations alike. The epidemiology of counterfeits is also wide in breadth and scope, including thousands of counterfeit incidents per year, encompassing all types of therapeutic classes, and employing a complex global supply chain network enabling this illegal activity. In addition, information technologies available through the Internet and sales via online pharmacies have allowed the criminal element to thrive in an unregulated environment of anonymity, deception, and lack of adequate enforcement. Though recent global enforcement efforts have led to arrests of online counterfeit sellers, such actions have not stemmed supplies from illegal online sellers or kept up with their creativity in illegally selling their products. To address this issue, we propose a global policy framework utilizing public-private partnership models with centralized surveillance reporting that would enable cooperation and coordination to combat this global health crisis. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1002/jps.22679,article

"Lamperti, Francesco and Mazzucato, Mariana and Roventini, Andrea and Semieniuk, Gregor",2019.0,"{The green transition: public policy, finance, and the role of the State","Summary: While investments into renewable energy technologies are growing almost everywhere, the chances to meet ambitious emission and climate targets, as those envisaged in the Paris Agreement, are scant. To speed up the transition, policy makers need to design and implement a policy mix that could affect not just the quantity of green finance, but its quality as well. In this paper, we argue that a mission-oriented approach to the transition from an economy with high, to one with low greenhouse gas emissions, coupled with the state taking on the role of an entrepreneurial state, could provide an effective win-win strategy to address climate change concerns (embodied in emissions reduction and adaptation boosting) and build the basis for the next phase of growth and technological progress. In practice, this amounts to (i) abandoning the view that cost-internalization of environmental externalities would suffice to induce an effective transition (ii) developing a multi-level and cross-sectoral governance of the transition, with a clear direction in terms of the technological trajectory to favour, and (iii) designing a policy mix encompassing: fiscal instruments, targets and standards; public-private co-funding schemes; financial regulation; and disclosure practices. Social scientists should support such ambitious policy-design processes through adequate model development, where a combination of policies, and a directive role of the state, can be accommodated and examined in detail.",https://doi.org/10.3790/VJH.88.2.73,article

Using policy literacy theory, encompassing the citizens' perceptions regarding policies through the lens of their understanding, we delve into four predictors of smart city policy literacy, (1) demographics, (2) socioeconomic status, (3) geographic factors and (4) attitudes toward government. Using a national survey, we find that gender, age, income, education, marital status and the reputation of an organization are meaningfully associated with policy literacy. These findings underscore the nuanced nature of the human aspect, highlighting the significance of heterogeneous individual dispositions of smart cities. Against the backdrop of ongoing debates questioning the validity of a one-size-fits-all approach, our study embraces the multifaceted and personalized attributes of the citizenry, acknowledging the imperative role of the human dimension in designing smart cities. Points for practitioners: • Analyzing the policy literacy of citizens in the context of smart cities holds significant implications for public managers and officials, as it unveils the practical utilization of policies by service recipients. • Leveraging policy literacy theory, this research investigates individuals' smart city policy literacy and finds meaningful associations with gender, age, income, education, marital status and organizational reputation. • Acknowledging the varied viewpoints on smart cities and the limitations of a uniform approach is essential for policymakers and practitioners.

At this point, institutions' sustainability depends on how they handle crisis communication. It seems that institutions that can adapt themselves to changes regarding the usage of digital communication platforms are survivors, and even winners, of this crisis. The general belief concerning education in developing countries claims that these countries are slow in adapting to technological innovations. Being a developing country, North Cyprus has a multi-cultural environment due to the presence of international students in tertiary education. This study explores how two public and two private universities maintained sustainability in higher education during COVID-19 by discussing the public relations models (PR) that they have used regarding digital communication. This study uses a qualitative content analysis and a quantitative method. The paper asserts that the effective usage of digital communication contributes to the sustainability of universities during this crisis. The findings revealed that the posts (text/image/poster) and videos these universities share are more concentrated on either press agentry or the public information model. Yet, a two-way symmetrical model that maintains dialogue within stakeholders is practiced less than the other PR models.

However, although there are benefits of e-government implementation, there is the problem of employees' resistance to change, as people tend to resist any kind of new system. This research was conducted for the purpose of examining the effect of employees' resistance to change including resistance to modern technology, fear of loss of control, feelings of insecurity, fear of inability to implement change, and fear of workload increasing, on implementing an e-government system represented in performance dimensions (efficiency and effectiveness) in Egypt. This paper reflects the lack of research into resistance to change in the specific context of e-government implementation in Egypt. We surveyed 400 respondents in several public organizations in Egypt to investigate the impact of such resistance, in order to determine which behaviors can affect any of the implemented e-government dimensions. The study also determines the differences between employees' responses to implementing the new system depending on variables such as gender, age, educational level, job position, and level of experience. The results reveal that fear of loss of control and fear of workload increasing affect all dependent variables significantly, while feelings of insecurity does not affect efficiency significantly.

Design/methodology/approach: This study draws on insights from institutional logics theory, and legitimacy and stewardship behaviour literature. We conducted an extended literature review to gain a comprehensive understanding of “institutional logics” and their manifestations in organizational contexts, utilizing the 2000–2024 data collected from the EBSCO, Scopus and Web of Science databases, complemented with Google Scholar. We gather that institutional logics manifest in several forms, and that while some organizations may thrive on a single logic, in certain contexts institutional logics can manifest in combinations – “multiple logics or hybrids”. Based on this understanding, we developed testable research hypotheses, predicting the influences of institutional logics – professional logic, efficient service logic and delivery (market) logic, on legitimacy, stewardship behaviour and specifications quality. We then carried out an empirical study, adopting a quantitative cross-sectional survey design with a self-administered questionnaire to test the hypothesized relationships. The empirical data were obtained from 162 procuring and disposing entities in Uganda and analyzed using the partial least squares structural equation modelling technique. Findings: The study findings reveal that institutional logics exert a strong positive effect on the legitimacy of the procurement process and on stewardship behaviour, which, in turn, both positively influence specifications quality. Research limitations/implications: The study findings have implications for theory and practice. The study findings provide useful insights that support the conceptual and theoretical development of institutional logics theory and applications in procurement literature. In addition, the study findings enhance procurement managers' understanding of the mechanisms through which institutional logics can foster specifications quality. However, considering the fact that the study was conducted in a single country context, and focused on the public sector only, the findings of the study might not be generalizable globally. Originality/value: This study contributes to established knowledge about quality management and procurement by examining the legitimacy of the procurement process and stewardship behaviour of those involved in procurement processes as mechanisms through which procuring entities are able to use institutional logics to enhance specifications quality. In addition, the study highlights areas for future research that may be explored to increase understanding of the value of institutional logics in ensuring specifications quality, and the link between specifications quality and the general performance of procuring entities.",https://doi.org/10.1108/IJQRM-10-2023-0302,article

Provision of sports fishery, supplemental to stocks, to fill empty niches, control weeds, and disease vectors and even create a commercial fishery are some of the reasons why fish species are introduced into new ecosystems. Lake Victoria and Lake Naivasha in Kenya have seen several introductions as discussed in this paper. In Lake Victoria for example, some of the species introduced include Nile perch, Lates niloticus, Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, Tilapia zilii, and Oreochromis esclentus among others. The most successful introductions have been that of the Nile perch, Nile tilapia and water hyacinth. Lake Naivasha too has witnessed a number of introductions into its fisheries too. Some of the successful introductions into the lake are those of the Common carp, Cyprinus carpio, the largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, the Nile tilapia, O. niloticus and Louisiana red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkia. Aside from the fish species mentioned, some invasive plant species have also been introduced into these two lake ecosystems. Of notable success and impacts have been the water hyacinth, Eichhornia crassipes and Nile cabbage, Pistia stratiotes. These introductions have had both negative and positive impacts on the fisheries and the ecology of the two lakes. Some of the impacts have been predation on the native species by the introduced species like in the case of Nile perch and largemouth bass in Lake Victoria and Naivasha respectively. Competition for resources and hybridization with the native species has also been witnessed in the case of the tilapiines in the two lakes with undesirable results. Blockage of navigation routes caused by the invasive plants has been a major problem in the two lakes sometimes leading to massive postharvest losses by the fishermen. On the other hand, some introduced species have led to an increase in fish landings as well as utilization of the niches that were initially vacant within these ecosystems. It can therefore be concluded that introduced species often have more negative effects on the native species and therefore such introductions should be based on sound scientific research in order to minimize their effects within the new environments.",https://doi.org/10.31730/osf.io/b5nyt,misc

After initial subsidies expire, however, a number of smart city initiatives face problems with respect to value creation and value capture. To analyse these processes, the paper links value creation (i.e. activities focusing on innovation challenges)to value capture (i.e. activities referring to actual individual firm-level profit generation)in smart city initiatives. Based on an in-depth survey of the literature, the purpose of the paper is to better understand how processes of internal alignment foster value creation and value capture during the growth of smart city initiatives. By focusing on the determinants of internal alignment facilitating value creation and value capture, the paper examines these determinants in the context of four smart city initiatives in the Netherlands in 2016. The paper shows that internal alignment of actors aimed at integrating joint and business objectives is critical for the growth of smart city initiatives. From the theoretical view point, the paper points at challenges concerning internal alignment of different actors in the smart city initiative after the formation stage. From the managerial point of view, it becomes increasingly important to manage expectations of different partners and their learning efforts to account for internal alignment during the growth of the smart city initiative.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.TELPOL.2018.12.004,article

However, value cocreation is an interactive process, and service value can only be created through joint efforts of all participants. This study builds an influence factor model of public engaging intention towards EGS value co-creation, based on technology acceptance theory, trust theory, and motivation theory, to explore the impact factors and impact paths. Comprehensive validation is further conducted through path analysis using structural equation modeling (SEM) methods. Path analysis interprets how the public will accept and adopt value co-creation behavior for EGS. The results presented in this study might be helpful for government policymakers or IT managers seeking to enhance EGS value creation through designing more effective incentive mechanisms. This study also introduces a comprehensive picture of the potential paradigm of public service value creation in an era of increasing user dominance.",https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2934138,article
"Whittemore, Robin and Knafl, Kathleen",2005.0,{The integrative review: Updated methodology,"Aim. The aim of this paper is to distinguish the integrative review method from other review methods and to propose methodological strategies specific to the integrative review method to enhance the rigour of the process. Background. Recent evidence-based practice initiatives have increased the need for and the production of all types of reviews of the literature (integrative reviews, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and qualitative reviews). The integrative review method is the only approach that allows for the combination of diverse methodologies (for example, experimental and non-experimental research), and has the potential to play a greater role in evidence-based practice for nursing. With respect to the integrative review method, strategies to enhance data collection and extraction have been developed; however, methods of analysis, synthesis, and conclusion drawing remain poorly formulated. Discussion. A modified framework for research reviews is presented to address issues specific to the integrative review method. Issues related to specifying the review purpose, searching the literature, evaluating data from primary sources, analysing data, and presenting the results are discussed. Data analysis methods of qualitative research are proposed as strategies that enhance the rigour of combining diverse methodologies as well as empirical and theoretical sources in an integrative review. Conclusion. An updated integrative review method has the potential to allow for diverse primary research methods to become a greater part of evidence-based practice initiatives. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1365-2648.2005.03621.X,article

Today, countless urban settlements across the globe have jumped into the so-called ‘smart city' bandwagon to achieve this goal. Under the smart city agenda, presently, many government agencies are attempting to engineer an urban transformation to tackle urban prosperity, liveability, and sustainability issues mostly through the means of technology solutions. Nonetheless, the notion of smart cities is ambiguous, and there are limited conceptual frameworks to assist cities and their administrations in understanding the big picture view of this urban development paradigm. The aim of this paper is to generate a clear understanding on the making of successful smart city practices. This is done by elaborating the smart cities notion through a multidimensional conceptual framework, examining smart city best practices across the globe—i.e., Songdo, Masdar, Amsterdam, San Francisco, Brisbane—, and providing insights of smart city approaches from these cases. The findings of the study disclose the need for a comprehensive smart city conceptualisation to inform policymaking and consequently the practice.

This is compounded in the so-called Smart Cities, where the objective of the IoT is to exploit information and communication technologies (ICTs) to support added-value services for citizens, giving companies more opportunities to innovate through the use of the latest technologies. In this context, multinational enterprises (MNEs) are building alliances, starting several projects with public and private city stakeholders aimed at exploring new technologies for cities but also at exploiting new IoT-based devices and services in order to profit from them. This implies that companies need to manage and integrate different types of knowledge to efficiently and effectively support the simultaneous pressure of exploration and exploitation, at a project portfolio level. Using structural equations modeling with data collected from 43 IoT smart city project alliances in Italy, this paper tests and finds evidence that MNEs need to develop knowledge management (KM) capabilities combined with ICT capabilities if they want to obtain greater ambidexterity performance at the project portfolio level. More specifically, we highlight that KM capabilities enhance alliance ambidexterity indirectly through firms' ICT capabilities, suggesting that MNE managers should design KM tools and develop new ICT skills. Implications for academics, managers and future lines of research are proposed.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.TECHFORE.2017.03.002,article

To date, the extant tourism literature on meetings, incentives, conventions, and exhibitions (MICE) tourism primarily focuses on value co-creation in the tourism industry, overlooking its integration into the urban environment for (i) city (and smart city) projects and (ii) its nexus with social aspects such as crime, which influences and shapes the urban environment. Considering 30 Italian cities over 13 years, this study employs a spatial-panel data approach to disentangle these relationships. The estimated results demonstrate that while urban mobility practices are highly responsive to MICE tourism, they are influenced by imbalances from increased users and visitors, which in turn affects urban security. This dynamic reduces the positive effect of MICE tourism on urban mobility, creating imbalances that public managers and policymakers must address. Practical implications are suggested to harness the potential of MICE tourism in current smart city projects.",https://doi.org/10.1080/13683500.2025.2458120,article
"Amin, Ash and Graham, Stephen",1997.0,{The ordinary city,"As debates on globalization have progressed from an earlier phase in which commentators saw the intensification of world-scale flows and processes as the negation of local identities and autonomies, the city has been 'rediscovered' as the powerhouse of the globalized economy. Against the view that questions, for example, the continued specificity of the urban in an era increasingly mediated by locationally liberating, advanced telecommunications and rapid transport networks, some strands of urban research assert that cities are becoming more important as the key creative, control and cultural centres within globalizing economic, cultural and social dynamics. Building on these strands, this paper evaluates the assets that cities and metropolitan regions provide in an era of globalization. It attempts to develop an alternative perspective on the city based on the idea that contemporary urban life is founded on the heterogeneity of economic, social, cultural and institutional assets, and concludes by using this perspective to- develop implications for urban policy and the quest for social and territorial justice. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.0020-2754.1997.00411.x,article

"Hassan, Abbas M. and Lee, Hyowon",2015.0,{The paradox of the sustainable city: definitions and examples,"It is well known that sustainability has become a much needed target, especially considering the recent rapid urban sprawl and the subsequent exacerbation of social, environmental, and economic problems. Thus, many studies have been conducted to define sustainability and the sustainable city. However, many of these definitions suggest a range of contradictions, implying that the achievement of sustainability is elusive. The problem lies in setting unreasonable definitions of sustainability and in the various contradictions to these definitions, making sustainability seemingly unattainable. Hence, some models of cities are emerging that are labeled as sustainable cities; among these are the “zero-carbon city” and the “ubiquitous eco-city” (“U-eco-city”). This study reviews the history and definitions of sustainability, in order to acknowledge the contradictions inherent in these concepts. It also briefly presents the compact city, the zero-carbon eco-city, and the U-eco-city by determining their individual pros and cons and highlighting where there are any conflicts with the principles of sustainability. The aim of the study was to adjust the use of sustainability as a terminology in the field of urban sustainable development and to demonstrate the extent to which we use marketing names for eco-cities without compliance with sustainable dimensions. The study will also discuss the key sustainability pillar required for a project to be kept sustainable. The study concludes that the use of the term “sustainable city” may limit the potential for further enhancing sustainability in future projects; using the term “transition toward the sustainable city” may be more accurate and more effective. The results show that reducing energy consumption through efficient use, and relying on renewable energies, will be the keys to reaching urban sustainability. The study also finds that recent tyranny in the name of ecology will not result in real sustainability. Although the free eco-city and the u-eco-city are considered advanced models, their limitations are related more to the economic and social aspects than to the compact city, which clearly reflected the pillars of sustainability, despite its being an outdated model.",https://doi.org/10.1007/S10668-014-9604-Z,article

"Offenhuber, Dietmar",2019.0,{The platform and the bricoleur—Improvisation and smart city initiatives in Indonesia,"This article investigates the design and evolution of smart city platforms in the global south using the Indonesian cities of Jakarta and Surabaya as case studies. While smart city projects are often framed in generic rhetoric of efficiency and modernization, the concept was originally formulated for cities in developed countries, and therefore requires adjustment for the local conditions in the developing world. While the former can rely on established institutions and well-developed infrastructures, the latter are characterized by rapid urbanization, weaker institutions, a lack of resources and public services. Unlike their highly regulated counterparts, cities in the global south are shaped by a dynamic informal economy and practices of improvisation. Using the lens of organizational improvisation, this article investigates how urban platforms emerge, and how they adapt to improvisational practices in the administration and the urban population. The article investigates different types of urban data platforms and their relationship with the social practices of their users. With Indonesian Smart City initiatives in Jakarta and Surabaya as a case study, this article aims to identify the local needs that motivated these cities to develop their respective projects. The second question asks how smart city implementations respond and adapt to the specific local conditions and the improvisational practices of their users. Distinguishing three types of urban data platforms, the article characterizes specific processes of bricolage and argues for stronger consideration of processes of improvisation in the design of urban data platforms. The contribution is threefold. The article provides a framework based on improvisation and bricolage that allows the social dynamics around smart city platforms and their impact on the system to be differentiated. It provides lessons on how traditional smart city models need to be adapted for cities in emerging economies. Finally, it offers a critique of the platform metaphors that are normally taken for granted.",https://doi.org/10.1177/2399808319865749,article
"Reddy, Purshottama S.",2016.0,{The politics of service delivery in South Africa: The local government sphere in context,"The post-1994 democratic developmental South African state opted for a strong local government system which has been constitutionalised, in terms of Chapter 7 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Act 108 of 1996. The politicisation of the local bureaucracy was inevitable as the ruling party sought to ensure that the executive leadership of municipalities shared the same political ideology and vision to facilitate local development. This raises the question, where does politicisation commence and end, and what is the ideal local political interface for efficient and effective service delivery and, more importantly, to ensure good governance? These questions have to take cognisance of the fact that South Africa is a ‘struggle democracy' and development has to take place in historically disadvantaged areas, where services have been poor or non-existent. The historically advantaged areas have to also be maintained and upgraded, as they are key to financial sustainability of the municipalities. The increasing service delivery protests is a matter for concern, if one has to take cognisance of the popular adage highlighted in official literature, ‘if local government fails, South Arica fails'. Given that the struggles for a democratic South Africa were fought at the grassroots level, this has to translate to an improved quality of life for local communities. Consequently, sound political management is key to enhanced municipal service delivery and ultimately good local governance. This paper reviews political trends and developments up to 2016, but excludes any discussion on the recent local government elections.",https://doi.org/10.4102/TD.V12I1.337,article

The study aimed to explore the prevalence of telehealth consultations amongst allied health professional (AHP) services in the UK National Health Service (NHS), and the potential impact on health inequities and burden of treatment for patients. Methods: Cross-sectional online survey. Participants were practising UK registered AHP and/or AHP service manager in an NHS/social care/local authority service. Data was collected between May – June 2021. Results: 658 participants took part in this study, including 119 AHP service managers, managing a total of 168 AHP services, and 539 clinicians. 87.4% of clinicians and 89.4% of services represented were using telehealth consultations as a method of delivering healthcare, the majority reported their services were planning to continue using telehealth post COVID-19 restrictions. Participants reported a lack of technological skills for patients as the most prevalent barrier affecting the patient's ability to conduct a telehealth consultation, followed by a lack of technology for patients. These were also reported as the biggest disadvantages of telehealth for patients. The majority of clinicians reported a reduction in the cost of parking/transport to attend hospital appointments as a patient benefit of telehealth consultations. Reported benefits for clinicians included saving travel time/costs and allowing flexible working, while benefits to the AHP service included patient flexibility in how their appointments are conducted and reducing the potential exposure of staff to communicable diseases. Conclusions: The current large-scale implementation of telehealth in NHS AHP services may increase disparities in health care access for vulnerable populations with limited digital literacy or access. Consequently, there is a danger that telehealth will be considered inappropriate and thus, underutilised, negating the potential benefits of sustainability, patient empowerment and the reduction in the burden of treatment.",https://doi.org/10.1186/S12939-022-01689-2,article

Using survey data collected from Nigeria, the model is empirically tested and validated through structural equation modelling analysis. Findings identify democracy, reflexivity and productivity in order of importance, as the three distinct value types desired as outcomes by citizens. Furthermore, results show service quality as the most salient factor significant in predicting citizen satisfaction and citizen trust in eGovernment, while both service quality and citizen satisfaction are significant in predicting net benefits.

The two questions that guided the research were: (1) What is the current state of research on the public value of e-government? And (2) What value is e-government supposed to yield? Six, sometimes overlapping, values were found: Improved public services; improved administrative efficiency; Open Government (OG) capabilities; improved ethical behaviour and professionalism; improved trust and confidence in government; and improved social value and well-being. These six public value dimensions were thereafter generalized into three overarching, and also overlapping, public value dimensions of Improved Public Services, Improved Administration, and Improved Social Value.

Across five empirical studies (total N = 1470), we consistently found that, overall, the most preferred decision-making model is a balanced model in which citizens and the government are equally involved. Despite this preferred ‘overall' pattern of equal involvement, we identified three subgroups within the citizenry with different preference curves: Some citizens prefer a model in which citizens and the government are truly equal partners, whereas others prefer a model in which either the government or citizens are relatively more involved in the policy decision-making process. The main contribution of our work is thus that we identified a perceived ‘overall' optimal level of citizen engagement, and variations to that optimum depending on citizens' individual traits.

Big data and smart urbanism,"'Smart cities' is a term that has gained traction in academia, business and government to describe cities that, on the one hand, are increasingly composed of and monitored by pervasive and ubiquitous computing and, on the other, whose economy and governance is being driven by innovation, creativity and entrepreneurship, enacted by smart people. This paper focuses on the former and, drawing on a number of examples, details how cities are being instrumented with digital devices and infrastructure that produce 'big data'. Such data, smart city advocates argue enables real-time analysis of city life, new modes of urban governance, and provides the raw material for envisioning and enacting more efficient, sustainable, competitive, productive, open and transparent cities. The final section of the paper provides a critical reflection on the implications of big data and smart urbanism, examining five emerging concerns: the politics of big urban data, technocratic governance and city development, corporatisation of city governance and technological lock-ins, buggy, brittle and hackable cities, and the panoptic city. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1007/S10708-013-9516-8,article

"Hamidi, Shima and Zandiatashbar, Ahoura and Bonakdar, Ahmad",2019.0,{The relationship between regional compactness and regional innovation capacity (RIC): Empirical evidence from a national study,"Innovation has become a key driver of economic growth, benefitting from knowledge production and technological advancements. Existing literature on the geography of innovation examines agglomeration economies, density, and the diversity of knowledge intensive firms, yet often overlooks the role of urban form. Generally, compact urban form, as opposed to sprawling regions, offers rich amenities, accessibility to public transit and a higher quality of places. Since such features attract educated millennial, the driving force behind knowledge-based and innovation economy, compact regions could be conducive to the innovation capacity. This study builds on Metropolitan Compactness Index (MCI) and examines the relationship between regional compactness and Regional Innovation Capacity (RIC) in the US. Findings indicate that all three indicators of RIC – the average number of patents, firm innovations, and the number of innovative small firms – are positively associated with MCI, while their relationships were significant in two models. Policy implications suggest that sprawling regions could hinder the innovation capacity, while compact regions could remove the physical barriers to innovation generation through offering high quality places and accessibility to urban amenities. This could facilitate social interactions and enhance social capital, while minimizing poverty and segregation.

"Youn, Eric",2007.0,{The relationship between technology content in a masters of social work curriculum and technology use in social work practice: A qualitative research study,"In the past several years, Masters of Social Work (MSW) programs around the nation (USA) have been adding technology courses to their curriculums, suggesting the need for more technology education in MSW programs. Literature reviews of attitudes of social work faculty and social workers indicate a historic trend of resistance to use of technology in the field. In order to better understand the purpose of technology content in MSW curriculums and how it relates to social workers' use of technology in the field, this research project does a qualitative study among faculty and MSW graduates working at local human service agencies to answer the following exploratory research questions: (1) What is the technology content of an MSW Curriculum? (2) What is the purpose of the technology content in an MSWCurriculum? (3) What is the amount of technology use in human service agencies by MSWs? (4) When MSWs first come to human service agencies, do they have the technological competence needed? (5) What skills are they lacking (if any?) This exploratory study used three series of interviews and a syllabi and job description review in its methodology. The first set of interviews was with human service agency administrators who hire MSWs. The second set of interviews was with human service agency staff members who graduated with an MSW degree. The third set of interviews was with select faculty members in order to find out what the technology content and purpose is for MSWs. Syllabi from technology classes were analyzed. Job application descriptions from human service offices were also analyzed. To ensure the validity of the data, interviews with all sets of interviewees were tape-recorded. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1300/J017V25N01_03,article

The ‘Right to the City' calls for citizens as ‘users' of cities to be integral parts to the socio-technological processes that shape urban space. This article explores how citizens can participate meaningfully, and whether data protection rights can be instrumental to this objective. It does so by analysing several smart city projects in Belgium and the Netherlands that were affected by the GDPR. The findings illustrate that data protection impacts smart city developments, but meaningful influence of citizens, as in the Right to the City, remains very limited. The article argues that already dominant actors and decision-makers remain in control of ‘smart' urban developments, while citizens often lack awareness and data literacy.

This trend is of interest, as cities can only be smart if they are responsive to their citizens. In this paper, the intention to use such a mobile application among adult residents (n = 420) of a mid-sized city in the southeastern United States was examined using hierarchical linear regression analysis. The regression model that was tested indicated significant predictors of the intention to use the app in order to report municipal problems, such as power outages, and to request services for one's home or community, including: Performance expectancy (e.g., citizens' beliefs that the app would be efficient, helpful, convenient), effort expectancy (citizens' beliefs about difficulty of using the app), social influence, perceived cost (e.g., privacy loss, storage space, unwanted notifications), and prior use of city apps. Consistent with current research on technology adoption, performance expectancy had the strongest influence on app-use intentions. Additionally, citizens' trust in their city government's ability to effectively manage an app was a weak, positive predictor of app-use intentions; general trust in the city government did not predict app-use intentions.

We offer an overview of models developed in the literature as well as insights drawn from research related to Hurricane Katrina. Each model illustrates some aspect of the spectrum of disaster preparedness and recovery, beginning with risk perception and vulnerability assessments, and proceeding to notions of resiliency and capacity building. Concepts like social resilience are related to theories of ""social capital,"" which stress the importance of social networks, reciprocity, and interpersonal trust. These allow individuals and groups to accomplish greater things than they could by their isolated efforts. We trace two contrasting notions of community to Tocqueville. On the one hand, community is simply an aggregation of individual persons, that is, a population. As individuals, they have only limited capacity to act effectively or make decisions for themselves, and they are strongly subject to administrative decisions that authorities impose on them. On the other hand, community is an autonomous actor, with its own interests, preferences, resources, and capabilities. This definition of community has also been embraced by community-based participatory researchers and has been thought to offer an approach that is more active and advocacy oriented. We conclude with a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of community in disaster response and in disaster research. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1007/S11113-009-9133-X,article

Rom{\~{a,2018.0,{The smart city as a common place for tourists and residents: A structural analysis of the determinants of urban attractiveness,"This article presents a structural modeling analysis of the performance determinants of urban attractiveness, in terms of resident population and international tourism demand, in 40 global cities. The analysis focuses on the impacts of a diverse set of innovative drivers of urban value creation and sustainable solutions for city development (urban functions), which are collectively subsumed under the heading of 'sustainable smart city'. Recognizing that the dynamics and growth processes related to these urban functions may have different impacts on different types of stakeholders, potentially leading to the emergence of serious conflicts between guests/visitors and residents, we aim to derive model-based implications for urban and tourism management in the cities concerned in order to move towards the sustainable future city as ‘a place 4 all'. The results of our latent growth curve model confirm the existence of different impacts of urban functions on visitors' and residents' attractiveness. Cultural dynamics appears to be a major determinant for attracting new residents and supporting a strong international tourism industry. From an economic perspective, purely economic strength (in terms of absolute growth) appears to enhance city attractiveness for residents, while the dynamics observed in research and development activities influences the quality of employment instead of being a direct driver of population growth. While the social aspects of sustainability (framed under the concept of livability) and the urban environment typically exert higher impacts on urban attractiveness, accessibility appears mostly relevant for visitors. Our analysis suggests an uneasy balance between livability, environment, and population and visitor volume and growth.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2017.11.007,article

Debates about sustainability no longer consider sustainability solely as an environmental concern, but also incorporate economic and social dimensions. However, while a social dimension to sustainability is widely accepted, exactly what this means has not been very clearly defined or agreed. This paper aims to address this disparity through a detailed exploration and definition of the concept of social sustainability within the urban context. The relationship between urban form and social sustainability is explored and two main dimensions of social sustainability are identified and discussed in detail: equitable access and the sustainability of the community itself. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1002/SD.417,article
"Beretta, Ilaria",2018.0,{The social effects of eco-innovations in Italian smart cities,"The European Union promotes the paradigm of ecological modernization and the effectiveness of eco-innovations (European Environment Agency, 2014). This is evident, in particular, from the political and financial support that the Institution is devoting to smart cities. Thus far, most of the ‘smart' projects developed in European cities focus on the theme of the environment and its efficient management (European Union, 2014). However, what has not yet been adequately investigated is the issue of the social impact of these smart environmental projects (Beretta, 2014a, b, c). In particular, what seems important is the question of whether the projects with environmental objectives also yield beneficial results from the social point of view, with special reference to the issue of social inclusion. Who are the real beneficiaries of the projects of eco-innovation? Do the benefits extend to all citizens or are they likely to go to only some sectors of the population, often the wealthier ones, risking - among other things - promotion of the phenomenon of eco-gentrification? In more general terms, can we say that smart cities represent the ‘ideal' settings for the achievement of simultaneous environmental, economic and social development? This paper reports results from research conducted on smart environmental projects implemented in Italy and posted on the national web platform italiansmartcity.it. The project consisted in a qualitative analysis of the environmental projects presented, in order to analyze their social impacts, especially referring to the question of social inclusiveness and the risk of eco-gentrification. More generally, the analysis helps clarify whether the eco -innovations represent an effective tool for achieving sustainable development in the Italian context. Having said that, it cannot be assumed that readers are familiar with the European and Italian contexts. Par. 1 opens with a table that gives definitions of terms which are potentially not clear. It then shows ways that the European Union is institutionalizing eco-innovation and smart cities, remaining on the latest debate on them. Par. 2 highlights the risk of the technological rut the European Union is falling into; par. 3 illustrates the main results of research carried out on the smart cities in the Lombardy Region regarding the social effects of eco-innovations; par. 4 attempts to draw a provisional conclusion.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2017.07.010,article

The case of SmartCity Cologne, Germany","As a prominent and performative discourse, The Smart City has the potential to shape urban futures. Yet, its mostly top-down implementation and dominantly technocratic definition of problems raises critiques of The Smart City as the latest version of a series of post-political and neoliberal visions of urban governance. However, as smart cities are implemented into ‘actually existing' strategies locally, they are always negotiated and translated into place-specific contexts. Beyond critiquing the powerful discourse of The Smart City, the social innovation–(re)politicisation nexus (SIRN) spells out a framework for contesting and co-producing radically transformative smart city visions and politics as they take shape on the ground. Linking the empirical case study of the ‘top-down' implementation of SmartCity Cologne, Germany, to current ‘bottom-up' discourses on reclaiming the urban commons, we show how ‘true' and ‘real' social innovation must go hand-in-hand with a re-politicisation of hegemonic logics and discursive framings. In doing so, this paper makes theoretical and empirical contributions to public and academic discourse on which governance practices, methods and policies could contribute to radical transformations towards a ‘truly' smart and sustainable urban future.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0042098019869820,article

The review finds that there are two related, non-conflicting, schools of urban metabolism: one following Odum describes metabolism in terms of energy equivalents; while the second more broadly expresses a city's flows of water, materials and nutrients in terms of mass fluxes. Four example applications of urban metabolism studies are discussed: urban sustainability indicators; inputs to urban greenhouse gas emissions calculation; mathematical models of urban metabolism for policy analysis; and as a basis for sustainable urban design. Future directions include fuller integration of social, health and economic indicators into the urban metabolism framework, while tackling the great sustainability challenge of reconstructing cities. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2010.10.022,article

These advancements are reshaping data-driven planning strategies, practices, and approaches, thereby facilitating the achievement of environmental sustainability goals. This transformative wave signals a fundamental shift — marked by the synergistic operation of artificial intelligence (AI), artificial intelligence of things (AIoT), and urban digital twin (UDT) technologies. While previous research has largely explored urban AI, urban AIoT, and UDT in isolation, a significant knowledge gap exists regarding their synergistic interplay, collaborative integration, and collective impact on data-driven environmental planning in the dynamic context of sustainable smart cities. To address this gap, this study conducts a comprehensive systematic review to uncover the intricate interactions among these interconnected technologies, models, and domains while elucidating the nuanced dynamics and untapped synergies in the complex ecosystem of sustainable smart cities. Central to this study are four guiding research questions: 1. What theoretical and practical foundations underpin the convergence of AI, AIoT, UDT, data-driven planning, and environmental sustainability in sustainable smart cities, and how can these components be synthesized into a novel comprehensive framework? 2. How does integrating AI and AIoT reshape the landscape of data-driven planning to improve the environmental performance of sustainable smart cities? 3. How can AI and AIoT augment the capabilities of UDT to enhance data-driven environmental planning processes in sustainable smart cities? 4. What challenges and barriers arise in integrating and implementing AI, AIoT, and UDT in data-driven environmental urban planning, and what strategies can be devised to surmount or mitigate them? Methodologically, this study involves a rigorous analysis and synthesis of studies published between January 2019 and December 2023, comprising an extensive body of literature totaling 185 studies. The findings of this study surpass mere interdisciplinary theoretical enrichment, offering valuable insights into the transformative potential of integrating AI, AIoT, and UDT technologies to advance sustainable urban development practices. By enhancing data-driven environmental planning processes, these integrated technologies and models offer innovative solutions to address complex environmental challenges. However, this endeavor is fraught with formidable challenges and complexities that require careful navigation and mitigation to achieve desired outcomes. This study serves as a comprehensive reference guide, spurring groundbreaking research endeavors, stimulating practical implementations, informing strategic initiatives, and shaping policy formulations in sustainable urban development.

Indeed, a plethora of models exist explaining influential factors and mechanisms of technology use in classrooms, one of which—the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and versions thereof—has dominated the field. Although consensus exists about which factors in the TAM might predict teachers' technology adoption, the current field abounds in some controversies and inconsistent findings. This meta-analysis seeks to clarify some of these issues by combining meta-analysis with structural equation modeling approaches. Specifically, we synthesized 124 correlation matrices from 114 empirical TAM studies (N = 34,357 teachers) and tested the fit of the TAM and its versions. Overall, the TAM explains technology acceptance well; yet, the role of certain key constructs and the importance of external variables contrast some existing beliefs about the TAM.

To explore the relationships among factors and the educational effectiveness of mobile LMSs, students' demographic backgrounds (age and employment status), self-reported psychological data (self-efficacy, innovativeness, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness of mobile LMSs), and external factors (subjective norms) were collected from 1604 students from 10 repetitions of the same course in an online university in Korea, in addition to their test scores. The logistic regression results showed that age and employment status were significant factors in predicting students' adoption of mobile LMSs and that there were potential connections between mobile LMS use and students' gender, age, and psychological characteristics.

The model builds on the Constant et al.'s theory of information sharing. We propose that perceptions of information culture, attitudes regarding information ownership and propensity to share, as well as task and personal factors influence people's use of collaborative media. We found that task characteristics (task interdependence), perceived information usefulness and the user's computer comfort were most strongly associated with the person's use of collaborative media. Consistent with Constant et al.'s earlier findings, views of information ownership and propensity to share were significantly related to use. Interestingly, use of electronic media for sharing information and contacting people was weakly associated with a more structured, closed information culture. This implies that heavy users and sharers want more structured information flow in place, possibly due to their need to have reliable access to other individual's knowledge and information. Contrary to suggestions in the literature, a fully open, organic information culture may not always be most desirable. Implications for knowledge managers, practitioners and researchers are suggested. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/s0963-8687(00)00042-1,article

"Bezuidenhout, Louise and Havemann, Johanna",2021.0,{The varying openness of digital open science tools," Background : Digital tools that support open science practices play a key role in the seamless accumulation, archiving and dissemination of scholarly data, outcomes and conclusions. Despite their integration into open science practices, the providence and design of these digital tools are rarely explicitly scrutinized. This means that influential factors, such as the funding models of the parent organizations, their geographic location, and the dependency on digital infrastructures are rarely considered. Suggestions from literature and anecdotal evidence already draw attention to the impact of these factors, and raise the question of whether the open science ecosystem can realise the aspiration to become a truly “unlimited digital commons” in its current structure.  Methods : In an online research approach, we compiled and analysed the geolocation, terms and conditions as well as funding models of 242 digital tools increasingly being used by researchers in various disciplines.  Results : Our findings indicate that design decisions and restrictions are biased towards researchers in North American and European scholarly communities. In order to make the future open science ecosystem inclusive and operable for researchers in all world regions including Africa, Latin America, Asia and Oceania, those should be actively included in design decision processes.  Conclusions : Digital open science tools carry the promise of enabling collaboration across disciplines, world regions and language groups through responsive design. We therefore encourage long term funding mechanisms and ethnically as well as culturally inclusive approaches serving local prerequisites and conditions to tool design and construction allowing a globally connected digital research infrastructure to evolve in a regionally balanced manner.

The updated model of digital literacy consists of the following skills: photo-visual skills (understanding messages from graphical displays), repro-duction skills (utilizing digital reproduction to create new, meaningful materials from preexisting ones), branching skills (constructing knowledge from non-linear, hypertextual navigation), infor-mation skills (critically evaluating the quality and validity of information), socio-emotional skills (understanding the "" rules "" that prevail in the cyberspace and applying this understanding in vir-tual communication), and real-time thinking (the ability to process large volumes of stimuli at the same time, as in video games or in online teaching). The present paper presents results from per-formance-based studies of the author, that investigated the application of the above digital literacy skills conceptual model among different groups of users. Results clearly indicate that the younger participants performed better than the older ones, with photo-visual and branching literacy tasks, whereas the older participants were found to be more ""digitally-literate"" in reproduction and in-formation literacy tasks. The paper presents findings from recent studies that examined change over time in digital literacy skills. It sheds light on the cognitive skills that users utilize in per-forming with digital environments, and provides educators and software developers with helpful guidelines for designing better user-centered digital environments.",https://doi.org/10.28945/1621,article

Developing a typology of smart urban innovation,"The smart city is an increasingly popular topic in urban development, arousing both excitement and skepticism. However, despite increasing enthusiasm regarding the smartness of cities, the concept is still regarded as somewhat evasive. Encouraged by the multifaceted character of the concept, this article examines how we can categorize the different dimensions often included in the smart city concept, and how these dimensions are coupled to innovation. Furthermore, the article examines the implications of the different understandings of the smart city concept for cities' abilities to be innovative. Building on existing scholarly contributions on the smartness of cities and innovation literature, the article develops a typology of smart city initiatives based on the extent and types of innovations they involve. The typology is structured as a smart city continuum, comprising four dimensions of innovation: (1) technological, (2) organizational, (3) collaborative, (4) experimental. The smart city continuum is then utilized to analyze empirical data from a Norwegian urban development project triggered by a critical juncture. The empirical data shows that the case holds elements of different dimensions of the continuum, supporting the need for a typology of smart cities as multifaceted urban innovation. The continuum can be used as an analytical model for different types of smart city initiatives, and thus shed light on what types of innovation are central in the smart city. Consequently, the article offers useful insights for both practitioners and scholars interested in smart city initiatives.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.TECHFORE.2018.07.060,article

Towards this end, the concept of smart cities emerges as a promising policy option for effectively dealing with sustainability objectives. In this respect, the focus of the present paper is on the development of an ICT-enabled participatory planning framework for guiding policy-making towards the planning of smart cities. This framework is in alignment with the argument that smart-city solutions must start with the “city” not with the “smart,” shifting from a technology-pushed to an application-pulled smart-city planning approach, matching different types of “smartness” (technologies, tools, and applications) with different types of urban functions and contexts. It is also built upon a digital platform, integrating tools and technologies for data management and e-participatory planning that can support city- and citizen-specific decision making, capable of dealing with objectives for urban sustainability.",https://doi.org/10.1080/10630732.2015.1018725,article

It is normal practice to take into account the proposals and recommendations of citizens and organizations when making decisions in the field of territorial development. Nevertheless, the implementation of participatory governance mechanisms faces significant difficulties. This is primarily due to the lack of effective tools for analyzing the opinion of citizens and technologies for integrating urban communities into existing institutions of governance. This article discusses the ways of organizing expert polls based on the principles of “Socratic dialogue”. The idea of using social networks for testing and promoting urban development projects by analyzing social reactions to various urban initiatives is considered. The possibility of predicting public opinion about a specific solution for urban development using historical data from social networks has been investigated. An approach to the gamification of work with a social response to the urban environment state through virtual interactions with infrastructure objects is proposed. The prospects for gamification to motivate civic participation and improve the efficiency of feedback mechanisms between the city and its residents are discussed.",https://doi.org/10.3390/SU14159086,article

Modeling the evolution of disaster chains in multi-hazard scenarios is crucial for risk governance and urban resilience. However, existing multi-hazard models are limited by complex model design and fixed disaster types, making it impossible to ensure flexible reactions to complex and diverse scenarios. This study presents a disaster management system for disaster model service chain (DMSC) to implement interoperable multi-hazard modeling. To achieve efficient model interaction in the DMSC, a management module is designed to normalize heterogeneous single-hazard models based on disaster system theory and the Open Geospatial Consortium standards, enabling them to be accessible, reusable, and interoperable. The normalized models are then adaptively orchestrated through an orchestration module to establish optimal executable DMSCs for different multi-hazard scenarios.

"Coenen, Lars and Benneworth, Paul and Truffer, Bernhard",2012.0,{Toward a spatial perspective on sustainability transitions,"In the past decade, the literature on transitions toward sustainable socio-technical systems has made a considerable contribution in understanding the complex and multi-dimensional shifts considered necessary to adapt societies and economies to sustainable modes of production and consumption. However, transition analyses have often neglected where transitions take place, and the spatial configurations and dynamics of the networks within which transitions evolve. A more explicit spatial perspective on sustainability transitions contributes to the extant transitions literature in three ways. Firstly it provides a contextualization on the limited territorial sensitivity of existing literature. Secondly, it explicitly acknowledges and investigates diversity in transition processes, which follows from a 'natural' variety in institutional conditions, networks, actor strategies and resources across space. Thirdly, it encompasses not only greater emphasis but also an opportunity to connect to a body of literature geared to understanding the international, trans-local nature of transition dynamics. Concerned with the prevalent lack of attention for the spatial dimensions of sustainability transitions in most studies, this paper seeks to unpick and make explicit sustainability transition geographies from the vantage point of economic geography. The paper argues that there are two interrelated problems requiring attention: the institutional embeddedness of socio-technical development processes within specific territorial spaces, and an explicit multi-scalar conception of socio-technical trajectories. Following these arguments, the paper concludes that transitions research would do well to take a closer look at the geographical unevenness of transition processes from the perspective of global networks and local nodes. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.RESPOL.2012.02.014,article

One of the major IoT application areas that gets significant attention is smart city. Since it is unrealistic to expect full convergence toward a single IoT platform in the near future, it is mandatory to enable interworking between different platforms based on multiple standards, coexisting in the emerging smart cities. In this paper, we take the example of two global IoT standards, FIWARE and oneM2M, which are actively used in many smart city projects, and analyze them to show the feasibility of IoT platforms interworking. Based on the analysis, we design and implement a novel IoT interworking architecture providing a semantic driven integration framework suitable for smart city. The core idea behind our approach is to introduce interworking proxies that: 1) conduct a static mapping of sensor information between IoT platforms and 2) perform semantic interoperability using semantically annotated resources via a semantic interworking proxy that dynamically discovers new kinds of information and adapts itself to enable automatic translation of semantic data between given source and target IoT platforms while it is running. We present the system based on these proxies and evaluate it in Santander smart city. The results demonstrate that it is able to discover and manage IoT sensors connected to both oneM2M and FIWARE.

The concept envisages a data-enhanced future and efficiency gains made possible by automation and innovation in city activities and utilities. However, the way smart cities are created brings about two weaknesses. First, there is strong compartmentation of solutions and systems, which are developing in vertical markets for energy, transport, governance, safety, etc., silos with little interoperability and sharing of resources. Second, there is a low impact, some increase in efficiency, some reduction in costs, time gained, some decrease in CO2 emissions. There is an important knowledge gap about developing cross-sector, high-impact smart city systems. This paper deals with these challenges and investigates a different direction in smart city design and efficiency. We focus on ‘Connected Intelligence Spaces' created in smart city ecosystems, which (a) have physical, social, and digital dimensions; (b) work as systems of innovation enabling synergies between human, machine, and collective intelligence; and (c) improve efficiency and performance by innovating rather than optimizing city routines. The research hypothesis we assess is about a universal architecture of high impact smart city projects, due to underlying connected intelligence spaces and cyber-physical-social systems of innovation. We assess this hypothesis with empirical evidence from case studies related to smart city projects dealing with safety (Vision-Zero), transportation (MaaS), and energy (positive energy districts). We highlight the main elements of operation and how high efficiency is achieved across these verticals.

The researcher both maps and assesses the relevant intellectual territory in order to specify a research question which will further develop the knowledge base. However, traditional 'narrative' reviews frequently lack thoroughness, and in many cases are not undertaken as genuine pieces of investigatory science. Consequently they can lack a means for making sense of what the collection of studies is saying. These reviews can be biased by the researcher and often lack rigour. Furthermore, the use of reviews of the available evidence to provide insights and guidance for intervention into operational needs of practitioners and policymakers has largely been of secondary importance. For practitioners, making sense of a mass of often-contradictory evidence has become progressively harder. The quality of evidence underpinning decision-making and action has been questioned, for inadequate or incomplete evidence seriously impedes policy formulation and implementation. In exploring ways in which evidence-informed management reviews might be achieved, the authors evaluate the process of systematic review used in the medical sciences. Over the last fifteen years, medical science has attempted to improve the review process by synthesizing research in a systematic, transparent, and reproducible manner with the twin aims of enhancing the knowledge base and informing policymaking and practice.

We use the concept of SDP (service dominant platform) as a key contributor in a smart city's construction to explain how value can be co-created during the formation and evolution of the platform. Drawing on case materials from a Business-oriented platform named WeChat in Guangzhou and a government-oriented one in Shanghai, an analytic framework on platform and service innovation-relevant theories are built around the dynamic cyclical value co-creation, and three elements are identified in this process defined as value proposition, value in exchange and value in use, which consist of ten sub-elements on different SDPs along four dimensions, namely openness, services innovation, governance and resource.

In doing so, we build on debates around smart citizens, smart public participation, and grassroots and bottom-up smart cities that are concerned with making smart cities more inclusive. The growing critical scholarship on such discourses, however, alerts us to the knowledge politics that are involved in, and the urban inequalities that are deeply rooted within, the urban. Technological interventions contribute to these politics and inequalities in various ways. Accordingly, we discuss limitations of the current discourses around inclusive smart cities and suggest a need for a nuanced definition of ‘inclusiveness'. We also discuss the necessity to further engage with critical data studies in order to ‘know' what we are critiquing.",https://doi.org/10.1111/GEC3.12504,article

This study fills that need by presenting evidence-based research on such preferences and perceptions from the perspective of need theories, taking Taiwan as a case study. Specifically, we investigated Taiwanese citizens' preferences for 35 SC services of seven dimensions classified in two domains, as well as their three perceptions of the usefulness of these SC services in the realization of human needs. The results show that most of our respondents clearly perceived SC services as both important and useful to their existence, relatedness, and growth needs, and that they expressed relatively higher preferences for such services to operate in the “hard” domain – e.g., smart energy, smart transport, or smart safety –than the “soft” one, e.g., smart living. Based on these findings, this study provides policy recommendations that, if implemented, could be expected to advance SC development by increasing citizens' usage of SC services in both the hard and soft domains, and serve the wider aim of improving their well-being and quality of life.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2020.102691,article

For developing this model, REMOURBAN is implementing several strategies at city level based on: the creation of a holistic catalogue of innovative technologies and solutions on energy, mobility and ICTs favouring the replicability, the identification and overcome of nontechnical barriers, the development of new integrated business models oriented at the creation of a European market for innovation and the definition of a complete evaluation procedure using sustainability and smartness indicators. This urban renovation strategy is focused on the citizens, where they become the cornerstones to making a smart city a reality For this reason, citizens are being actively engaged in REMOURBAN and the population awareness about energy and environmental impact of their daily activities are increased. In order to ensure the usefulness and high replication of the REMOURBAN project at European level, the sustainable urban regeneration model is aimed at the decision makers, investors, public administrations and the industrial sector. Furthermore, in order to ensure this replicability, two follower cities, Seraing (Belgium) and Miskolc (Hungary) are involved in the project so they can apply the developed model once it is validated. The project will allow demonstrating that, by means of improving the current conditions of a city, it is possible to achieve low energy districts and more sustainable urban transport, as well as to perceive a greater quality of life. REMOURBAN, thus, will focus on improving the energy efficiency, reduction of GHG emissions, refurbishment of districts, transport sustainability, access to urban information and citizen engagement. A big impact across Europe is intended to be achieved by the REMOURBAN project results at European level, showing the model for sustainable urban regeneration can be easily applied and replicated. With the aim at maximizing the impact of the project results, REMOURBAN is deploying a powerful communication and dissemination plan that integrates a citizen engagement strategy and has started to disseminate the benefits of the project to a wide variety of audiences.",https://doi.org/10.9770/JESI.2017.4.3S(8),article

But concrete empirical evidence of this potential is visibly lacking. In parallel, researchers have brought attention to the emergence of the so-called ‘smart city 2.0'. This is framed as a decentralised, people-centric approach where smart technologies are employed as tools to tackle social problems, address resident needs and foster collaborative participation. This contrasts to the techno-economic and centralised approach of the dominating ‘smart city 1.0' or first-generation paradigm, which is primarily focused on diffusing smart technologies for corporate and economic interests. Utilising this dichotomy as an analytical framework, this paper examines Aizuwakamatsu Smart City in Fukushima, Japan to demonstrate how a smart city can be framed and implemented as a tool for tackling endogenous social challenges. Findings unearth a myriad of novel approaches to utilising data and ICT to respond to resident needs, improve livelihoods and widely share smart city benefits. Yet they also point to a need to transcend polarised discourses around alternative models of smart cities and appreciate the messy reality of hybrid, on-the-ground smart urbanisation and the co-existence of contrasting yet complementary visions and approaches.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.TECHFORE.2018.07.033,article

This paper explores the characteristics and factors contributing to the gender digital divide. To bridge the gender digital divide, it is important to understand the factors behind gender differences in ICT access and use. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, the systematic literature review was conducted in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) approach. In total, 24 articles were selected and analysed with using PRISMA steps. Findings: Despite a significant increase in usage of the internet and other ICTs around the world, women, especially in developing countries, tend to be on the wrong side of the digital divide. The results indicate that while there are still gender differences in access to ICT in developing countries, second-level digital divide issues are more of a concern in developed countries.

Academics and their community partners can benefit from such direction and assistance as they establish and maintain community-based participatory research (CBPR) partnerships. Research partners from the University of Pittsburgh, the Johns Hopkins Center for Injury Research and Policy, and the House of Ruth Maryland, one of the nation's leading domestic violence centers serving Baltimore and the surrounding areas, joined together to design, implement, and evaluate a series of activities to increase local CPBR capacity. Objectives: This article provides an overview of process and findings from two CBPR workshops jointly held for academic and community members and explores specific suggestions from the workshop participants about how to put the CBPR principles into practice to promote community engaged research to address intimate partner violence (IPV). Methods: Twenty-four academic and community partners with experience addressing IPV participated in the two workshops. Facilitators led discussions based on the core CPBR principles. Participants were asked to interpret those principles, identify actions that could help to put the principles into practice, and discuss challenges related to CBPR approaches for IPV research. Observational notes and transcripts of the discussions and workshop evaluations are summarized. Results: The CBPR principles were interpreted and revised through consensus into common language that reflected the group discussion of the core CBPR principles. Workshop participants provided a range of actions for putting the principles into practice and identified the need for sensitivity in relation to IPV research. A majority of participants felt that the workshop generated novel ideas about how they could use CPBR in their own work. Conclusions: Translating CBPR principles into common, action-oriented language is a useful first step when building a new academic-community research partnership. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1353/CPR.2013.0025,article

With the increased digitization of our world, recent work suggests that the digitally-enabled relationships of how policy makers and citizens observe each other may transform policy making in a fundamental way. In this paper, we use complexity theory to examine how digitally-enabled transparency affects the effectiveness of policy making in aligning citizens with the policy goal to improve collective human welfare. We map Kauffman's NKC fitness landscape model, a generalizable theory of co-evolutionary complexity, to the phenomenon of transparent policy making in order to explain how transparency as an enabling generative mechanism encourages citizens to align with the policy goal without exercising central control. In our framework, citizens are agents who co-evolve by adapting to information available in their citizen landscapes. These landscapes represent the citizens' decision context, which policy makers observe and modify throughout an iterative policy cycle. In our study we identify three types of transparencies that relate to three properties of the citizens' decision context: (1) individual decision interdependence; (2) decision bias; and (3) collective decision interdependence. Using conceptual modeling, a form of inquiry combining formal representation with empirical sense making in three policy domains (e-health, smart transportation, and smart energy), we articulate and empirically validate two generative mechanisms that explain transparency effects for each of the three transparencies: (1) orchestration via iterative landscape “tuning” to reduce ambiguity and simplify citizens' alignment with the policy goal; and (2) social learning via information sharing, a co-evolutionary social “nudge” that encourages citizens to be more open to behavioral changes.

"Zaniewski, Elizabeth and {Dao Ostinelli",2020.0,{Trends in CD4 and viral load testing 2005 to 2018: multi-cohort study of people living with HIV in Southern Africa,"Introduction: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a CD4 cell count before starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) to detect advanced HIV disease, and routine viral load (VL) testing following ART initiation to detect treatment failure. Donor support for CD4 testing has declined to prioritize access to VL monitoring. We examined trends in CD4 and VL testing among adults (≥15 years of age) starting ART in Southern Africa. Methods: We analysed data from 14 HIV treatment programmes in Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe in 2005 to 2018. We examined the frequency of CD4 and VL testing, the percentage of adults with CD4 or VL tests, and among those having a test, the percentage starting ART with advanced HIV disease (CD4 count <200 cells/mm3) or failing to suppress viral replication (>1000 HIV-RNA copies/mL) after ART initiation. We used mixed effect logistic regression to assess time trends adjusted for age and sex. Results: Among 502,456 adults, the percentage with CD4 testing at ART initiation decreased from a high of 78.1% in 2008 to a low of 38.0% in 2017; the probability declined by 14% each year (odds ratio (OR) 0.86; 95% CI 0.86 to 0.86). Frequency of CD4 testing also declined. The percentage starting ART with advanced HIV disease declined from 83.3% in 2005 to 23.5% in 2018; each year the probability declined by 20% (OR 0.80; 95% CI 0.80 to 0.81). VL testing after starting ART varied; 61.0% of adults in South Africa and 10.7% in Malawi were tested, but fewer than 2% were tested in the other four countries. The probability of VL testing after ART start increased only modestly each year (OR 1.06; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.06). The percentage with unsuppressed VL was 8.6%. There was no evidence of a decrease in unsuppressed VL over time (OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.01). Conclusions: CD4 cell counting declined over time, including testing at the start of ART, despite the fact that many patients still initiated ART with advanced HIV disease. Without CD4 testing and expanded VL testing many patients with advanced HIV disease and treatment failure may go undetected, threatening the effectiveness of ART in sub-Saharan Africa.",https://doi.org/10.1002/JIA2.25546,article

Despite this increasing interest, information systems (IS) literature is mostly silent on what really contributes to the success of e-government Web sites. To fill this gap, this study examines the role of trust in e-government success using the updated DeLone and McLean IS success model as the theoretical framework. The model is tested via a survey of 214 Singapore e-government Web site users. The results show that trust in government, but not trust in technology, is positively related to trust in e-government Web sites. Further, trust in e-government Web sites is positively related to information quality, system quality, and service quality. The quality constructs have different effects on ""intention to continue"" using the Web site and ""satisfaction"" with the Web site. Post hoc analysis indicates that the nature of usage (active versus passive users) may help us better understand the interrelationships among success variables examined in this study. This result suggests that the DeLone and McLean model can be further extended by examining the nature of IS use. In addition, it is important to consider the role of trust as well as various Web site quality attributes in understanding e-government success. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.2753/MIS0742-1222250303,article

In addition, this environment encourages collaboration and breaking down walls of information asymmetries between various stakeholders. Public sector e-services has a legacy of a risk adverse environment where many times the focus is on the politically charged short-term delivery of goals and results, lacking a long-term strategy of managing the risk and renewal cycle around service innovation. The promises and potential that Web 2.0 technologies may provide still have to deal with fragile systems that are currently in place in public sector e-services.

However, it is the fourth leading cause of cancer mortality among women globally, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Whereas studies reveal the existence of ICC pre-cancerous lesion screening services in Kenya and Uganda, uptake of these services remains low, highlighting the existence of unidentified barriers. This study explored factors that impede access and utilization of pre-cancerous cervical screening services among women living with HIV in low resource settings in Uganda and Kenya. METHODS: a cross-sectional study design was used in six selected health facilities in Uganda and Kenya. A systematic cluster randomized sampling was used to select health facilities for women living with HIV who were invited to participate in the interviews. Data collection, coding, categorization, and statistical analysis of quantitative data were employed to rank and correlate among the most critical factors of the Health Belief Model framework. RESULTS: the results showed a negative correlation between the perceived barriers and the risk of accessing the services (-0.95, p-value 0.003) and the perceived severity (-0.95, p-value 0.004), both mean that the barriers for the women are so high that they prefer to delay the visit to the hospital. More, there was a positive correlation between perceived risk for ICC and perceived severity (0.90, p-value 0.01), meaning that a high perception of risk of ICC will increase its severity. Health system barriers to access such as lack of supplies, information, and limited staffing were also revealed. CONCLUSION: the study uncovered the health system barriers affecting ICC screening services at health facilities in Kenya and Uganda and their effects on the perceived illness.

The rising temperatures and increased rainfall variability associated with climate change are undermining the livelihoods and food security of Africa's farmers, most of whom work at a subsistence level and also face problems of poverty, inadequate infrastructure and poor governance. To address these problems, governments and development organizations have promoted climate-smart agriculture (CSA). These projects, however, have been constrained by inadequate data and predictions regarding future climate change. In particular, farmers in Africa need better projections of the climate hazards for specific regions. Historical weather data at the local level contains many gaps, and the continuing collection of such data could be much improved. Strengthening the database of observed weather is critical to understanding the changes that have occurred already, to project future changes, and to plan appropriately to address them. Once collected and analyzed, climate data must be communicated in ways that help decision-makers understand climate impacts. Good tools are available---such as ClimateWizard.org and Servir ClimateServ---but practitioners at the local level must have the access and training to use them.

Using as evidence the focus and evolution of this focus over the period 1994-2013 in a vast body of literature produced by academia, international organisations and practitioners, we show that: a) the deployment of e-government was for a long time concentrated on more technological and operational matters and that only more recently attention switched to broadly defined institutional and political issues (hypothesis 1a); and b) institutional and political barriers are one of the main factors explaining lack of e-government adoption (hypothesis 1b). A decision making process that is still unstructured, untrustworthy, and not fully leveraging the available evidence hinder the perception of public value and citizens' trust in government, which contribute to low level of e-government adoption. We conclude suggesting that a smart government producing public value is grounded in a triangle of good decision defined by politics, values, and evidence and that to achieve it public sector should go beyond the traditional concept of service innovation. It should rather introduce conceptual and systemic innovation pertaining to a new way of thinking and of interacting with stakeholders and citizens as sources of both legitimacy and evidence. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.GIQ.2014.01.008,article
{\AA,2012.0,{Understanding the rise of e-participation in non-democracies: Domestic and international factors,"While it has often been suggested that information and communication technologies (ICTs) provide an important means of increasing citizen participation (which is at the core of democratic government), few commentators have expected non-democracies to create online environments in which citizens can take an active part in political processes. In recent years, however, some non-democracies have begun to outperform countries with long-standing democratic traditions in terms of e-participation development. According to the 2010 United Nations (UN) e-government survey, Bahrain outranks France, Kazakhstan beats Sweden and Malaysia ranks higher than Germany. This article sets out to understand the recent rise of e-participation initiatives in non-democracies. Drawing on comparative longitudinal data from the UN e-government surveys, we tested the assertion that international drivers of change are competing with the dominant focus on domestic factors, especially in the non-democratic world, and are influencing the patterns of reform. The empirical analysis demonstrated important differences between the drivers of change in democratic and non-democratic countries and found economic globalization to be the strongest predictor of e-participation initiatives in non-democratic countries. In conclusion, we argue that economic globalization alters the context of e-participation and necessitates a re-examination of many of its premises and tenets. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.giq.2011.09.008,article

The study looked into the factors that influence students' decisions to use OL, which helps meet their individual needs beyond the confines of the traditional classroom. Design/methodology/approach: A study of 284 students from the universities of Gujarat in India was conducted using a self-administered questionnaire. The partial least square-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyse the study's test results. Findings: The result of the study confirms that perceived enjoyment (PE) has a fully significant relationship with the behavioural intention to use online learning (IOL), whereas self-efficacy (SE) is partially supported and system accessibility (ACC) has an insignificant impact on the IOL. Research limitations/implications: Though the study focussed on the TAM to analyse the proposed model, future studies should address other constructs like ICT infrastructure, perceived behavioural control, experience, etc. Originality/value: This research identified the key variables of students' intention to adapt to OL and offered a path to encourage higher education students to use online education as a classroom alternative. Educators in Indian administrative positions can better facilitate OL adoption amongst their student bodies by developing a keener awareness of students' goals and the factors influencing their views on the topic.",https://doi.org/10.1108/JARHE-09-2022-0302,article

According to several recent studies, French citizens are ready to purchase an electric car. Despite of these positive figures, sales of the electric cars are not really taking-off, but slightly increasing. Although, previous studies have identified motivation and barriers for the diffusion of electric cars (EC), we hypothesise, that the analysis of the a priori knowledge of the actors, in particular the users, can be enriched and it will provide a new understanding of the spread of EC. However, there is no studies explaining the types of representations people have of the EC, particularly for non-users, in order to have a better consideration of individuals, not so much as consumers or users, but rather as citizens. Thus, this paper explores the determining factors that determine how social groups perceive the emerging technology of EC and thus provide elements about a potential acceptability enabling its dissemination. In order to achieve this, this paper proposes a new approach based on the use of the AttrakDiff-2 questionnaire, a specific User eXperience (UX) method. This method assesses four different but complementary aspects of the social representation: the possibility of action of the subject on the system; the stimulation, caused, by the system; how the user will identify with the system and, the overall attraction. Data about the social representations of electric car for 131 potential users in the Lorraine Region of France were collected and analysed. Results show that there are differences of user representation regarding the socio-demographic variables. The proposed approach will provide relevant inputs to the infrastructure network design and Smart City policy decision makers.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.TECHFORE.2018.10.027,article

It is seen as a possible remedy for the challenges that urbanisation creates in the age of global climate change, and as an enabler of a sustainable and liveable urban future. A review of the abundant but fragmented literature on smart city theories and practices, nevertheless, reveals that there is a limited effort to capture a comprehensive understanding on how the complex and multidimensional nature of the drivers of smart cities are linked to desired outcomes. The paper aims to develop a clearer understanding on this new city model by identifying and linking the key drivers to desired outcomes, and then intertwining them in a multidimensional framework. The methodological approach of this research includes a systematic review of the literature on smart cities, focusing on those aimed at conceptual development and provide empirical evidence base. The review identifies that the literature reveals three types of drivers of smart cities—community, technology, policy—which are linked to five desired outcomes—productivity, sustainability, accessibility, wellbeing, liveability, governance. These drivers and outcomes altogether assemble a smart city framework, where each of them represents a distinctive dimension of the smart cities notion.

Nevertheless, it still represents a nascent field enduring uncertainties and complexities. In this regard, the interplay between digitalization and sustainability unfolds bright opportunities for shaping a greener economy and society, paving the way towards the SDGs. However, little evidence exists so far, about a genuine contribution of digital paradigms to sustainability. Besides, their role to tackle the SDGs research gaps remains unexplored. Thus, a holistic characterization of the aforementioned topics has not been fully explored in the emerging literature, deserving further research. The article endeavors a twofold purpose: (1) categorizing the main SDGs research gaps; (2) coupled with a critical exploration of the potential contribution of digital paradigms, particularly Big Data and Artificial Intelligence, towards overcoming the aforesaid caveats and pursuing the 2030 Agenda. Ultimately, the study seeks to bridge literature gaps by providing a first-of-its-kind overview on the SDGs and their nexus with digitalization, while unraveling policy implications and future research directions. The methodology has consisted of a systematic holistic review and in-depth qualitative analysis of the literature on the realms of the SDGs and digitalization. Our findings evidence that the SDGs present several research gaps, namely: flawed understanding of complexities and interlinkages; design shortcomings and imbalances; implementation and governance hurdles; unsuitable indicators and assessment methodologies; truncated adoption and off-target progress; unclear responsibilities and lacking coordination; untapped role of technological innovation and knowledge management. Moreover, our results show growing expectations about the added value brought by digitalization for pursuing the SDGs, through novel data sources, enhanced analytical capacities and collaborative digital ecosystems. However, current research and practice remains in early-stage, pointing to ethical, social and environmental controversies, along with policy caveats, which merit additional research. In light of the findings, the authors suggest a first-approach exploration of research and policy implications. Results suggest that further multidisciplinary research, dialogue and concerted efforts for transformation are required. Reframing the Agenda, while aligning the sustainable development and digitalization policies, seems advisable to ensure a holistic sustainability. The findings aim at guiding and stimulating further research and science-policy dialogue on the promising nexus amid the SDGs and digitalization.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.122204,article

This study reviews drones' current and emerging uses in SAR, with a focus on advancements in sensor integration, payload capacity, and multi-UAV coordination. It further explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can enhance operational efficiency. A comprehensive review methodology is employed to analyze recent progress in drone technology, AI, and digital twin simulations aimed at optimizing SAR missions. The review highlights the current capabilities, strengths, and limitations of existing systems while identifying potential innovations to address persistent challenges. Drones are now effectively deployed to survey vast areas, locate survivors, and assess hazards. Coordinated multi-drone systems have the potential to expand coverage, enhance efficiency, deliver essential supplies, and establish temporary communication networks in inaccessible regions. Future advancements in AI and autonomy will enable drones to perform complex tasks with minimal human intervention. Enhanced sensor technologies will improve detection capabilities, including infrared imaging, radar, and biometric monitoring. However, challenges such as regulatory restrictions, limited battery life, and payload constraints persist. Addressing these challenges will require ongoing research and technological breakthroughs.

In this article, we examine the iterative design of this technology as well as its introduction into the everyday practices of cyclists. We argue that efforts to quantify the ordinary experience of cycling were overwhelmed and interrupted by an ecology of breakdowns, everyday contingencies, forgetfulness, and re-interpretations in the assemblage of devices, data, humans, and bicycles. These breakdowns generated incoherent or absurd bits of information that we call them as “idiotic data” based on recent conceptualizations of the character of the idiot. Significant displacements were provoked by these idiotic data, forcing the engineer behind the device to control and purify the sample by design and algorithms, waning the civic nature of the project at the same time.

We deal with three types of urban commons, i.e., “urban green commons,” “coworking spaces,” and “community climate commons.” We describe how allotment gardens, community gardens, and other types of urban green commons contribute to environmental learning that may boost understanding of environmental issues and which constitute important learning arenas for climate-change mitigation and adaptation. We also deal with the newly emerging phenomenon of coworking spaces that share many essential institutional attributes of urban commons and which can work for climate-change mitigation through the benefits provided by a sharing economy and through reduction of domestic transportation and commuting distance. Community climate commons represent commons where local communities can mobilize together to create shared low-carbon assets and which hold the potential to empower certain segments and civil society groups so that they can have greater influence and ownership of the transformation of reaching net-zero carbon goals.

In these terms, the ideas and strategies of urban sustainability adopted by eco-city developers are understood as reflections of broader policy priorities. The case study employed in this article, Masdar City, reveals how the Emirati eco-city initiative is the product of local agendas seeking economic growth via urbanisation to preserve the political institutions of Abu Dhabi. Following the economic imperatives set by the ruling class, the Masdar City project interprets sustainability as ecological modernisation and practices urban environmentalism almost exclusively in economic terms.

There is growing interest in creating indicators of liveability to measure progress towards achieving a wide range of policy outcomes, including enhanced health and wellbeing, and reduced inequalities. This review aimed to: 1) bring together the concepts of urban 'liveability' and social determinants of health; 2) synthesise the various liveability indicators developed to date; and 3) assess their quality using a health and wellbeing lens. Between 2011 and 2013, the research team reviewed 114 international academic and policy documents, as well as reports related to urban liveability. Overall, 233 indicators were found. Of these, 61 indicators were regarded as promising, 57 indicators needed further development, and 115 indicators were not useful for our purposes. Eleven domains of liveability were identified that likely contribute to health and wellbeing through the social determinants of health. These were: crime and safety; education; employment and income; health and social services; housing; leisure and culture; local food and other goods; natural environment; public open space; transport; and social cohesion and local democracy. Many of the indicators came from Australian sources; however most remain relevant from a 'global north' perspective. Although many indicators were identified, there was inconsistency in how these domains were measured. Few have been validated to assess their association with health and wellbeing outcomes, and little information was provided for how they should be applied to guide urban policy and practice. There is a substantial opportunity to further develop these measures to create a series of robust and evidence-based liveability indices, which could be linked with existing health and wellbeing data to better inform urban planning policies within Australia and beyond. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.SOCSCIMED.2014.04.003,article

ULLs have different goals, they are initiated by various actors, and they form different types of partnerships. There is no uniform ULL definition. However, many projects studying and testing living lab methodologies are focusing on urban sustainability and low carbon challenges, as demonstrated by the current projects funded by the Joint Programming Initiative (JPI) Urban Europe. At the same time, there is no clear understanding of what the ultimate role of ULLs is in urban governance, and whether they represent a completely new phenomenon that is replacing other forms of participation, collaboration, experimentation, learning and governing in cities. There is a need to clarify what makes the ULL approach attractive and novel. The aim of this article is to develop current understandings through an examination of how the ULL concept is being operationalised in contemporary urban governance for sustainability and low carbon cities. This is undertaken through the analysis of academic literature complemented with five snapshot case studies of major ongoing ULL projects funded by JPI Urban Europe. Five key ULL characteristics are identified and elaborated: geographical embeddedness, experimentation and learning, participation and user involvement, leadership and ownership, and evaluation and refinement. The paper concludes by outlining a research agenda that highlights four key topics: ways in which the ULL approach is operationalised, the nature of ULL partnerships and the role of research institutions, the types of challenges addressed by different ULLs, and the role of sustainability and low carbon issues in framing ULLs.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.JCLEPRO.2015.08.053,article

In this context, two promising phenomena have gained interest from the academia, the public sector and the media: “smart cities” and “urban sharing”. Smart cities rely on the extensive use of information and communications technology (ICT) to increase efficiencies in urban areas, while urban sharing builds on the collaborative use of idling resources enabled by ICT in densely populated cities. The concepts have many similar features and share common goals, yet cities with smart city agendas often fail to take a stance on urban sharing. Thus, its potentials are going largely unnoticed by local governments. This article addresses this issue by exploring cases of London and Berlin–two ICT-dense cities with clearly articulated smart city agendas and an abundance of sharing platforms. Drawing on urban governance literature, we develop a conceptual framework that specifies the roles that cities assume when governing urban sharing: city as regulator, city as provider, city as enabler and city as consumer. We find that both cities indirectly support urban sharing through smart agenda programmes, which aim to facilitate ICT-enabled technical innovation and emergence of start-ups. However, programmes, strategies, support schemes and regulations aimed directly at urban sharing initiatives are few. We also find that Berlin is sceptical towards urban sharing organisations, while London took more of a collaborative approach. Implications for policy-makers are discussed in the end.",https://doi.org/10.1080/13549839.2018.1463978,article

This paper explores the notion of social sustainability and its main assessment methods, together with the pioneering social sustainability framework devised by the City of Vancouver, Canada. The paper illustrates how there is no consensus on the definition of social sustainability because this concept is currently being approached from diverging study perspectives and discipline-specific criteria, making a generalised definition difficult to achieve. In addition, traditional 'hard' social sustainability themes such as employment and poverty alleviation are increasingly being complemented or replaced by emerging 'soft' and less measurable concepts such as happiness, social mixing and sense of place. Within this context, the paper looks at how Vancouver's local authorities have approached urban social sustainability and discusses the importance of the selection of sustainability principles, objectives, themes, assessment techniques and indicators from a social perspective.",https://doi.org/10.1680/UDAP.2010.163.2.79,article

Using critical theoretical perspectives to examine tweets from 1 September 2016 to 31 December 2018, this article identifies key themes. These include: placement of the crisis in a contested, historical context; debates about naming the crisis; key concepts; depiction of several forms of violence; and potential options for resolution. Social media is being used by the government, Anglophone activists, and non-affiliated people to sway public opinions on the crisis and solicit the attention of local, Diaspora, and broader international communities.

Unfortunately, resistance to end-user systems by managers and professionals is a widespread problem. To better predict, explain, and increase user acceptance, we need to better understand why people accept or reject computers. This research addresses the ability to predict peoples' computer acceptance from a measure of their intentions, and the ability to explain their intentions in terms of their attitudes, subjective norms, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and related variables. In a longitudinal study of 107 users, intentions to use a specific system, measured after a one-hour introduction to the system, were correlated 0.35 with system use 14 weeks later. The intention-usage correlation was 0.63 at the end of this time period. Perceived usefulness strongly influenced peoples' intentions, explaining more than half of the variance in intentions at the end of 14 weeks. Perceived ease of use had a small but significant effect on intentions as well, although this effect subsided over time. Attitudes only partially mediated the effects of these beliefs on intentions. Subjective norms had no effect on intentions. These results suggest the possibility of simple but powerful models of the determinants of user acceptance, with practical value for evaluating systems and guiding managerial interventions aimed at reducing the problem of underutilized computer technology.",https://doi.org/10.1287/MNSC.35.8.982,article

A pressing issue for many governments is how to expand citizen acceptance of e-government systems. Prior studies on e-tax filing and payment systems have identified various factors for successful adoption, but do not capture the basic psychological needs of users in developing countries. This study examines the determinants of citizens' intention to adopt an e-tax filing and payment system in Thailand. The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology is integrated with self-determination theory, perceived risk, and perceived credibility to develop a model to explain the users' acceptance of e-government services. A large-scale survey of Thai taxpayers was conducted and the results show that performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence, and perceived credibility are all significant factors. Perceived autonomy and perceived competence are significant antecedents for performance and effort expectancy (EE). Perceived risk and EE surprisingly did not influence users' intentions.

In this paper, we (1) review user acceptance literature and discuss eight prominent models, (2) empirically compare the eight models and their extensions, (3) formulate a unified model that integrates elements across the eight models, and (4) empirically validate the unified model. The eight models reviewed are the theory of reasoned action, the technology acceptance model, the motivational model, the theory of planned behavior, a model combining the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior, the model of PC utilization, the innovation diffusion theory, and the social cognitive theory. Using data from four organizations over a six-month period with three points of measurement, the eight models explained between 17 percent and 53 percent of the variance in user intentions to use information technology. Next, a unified model, called the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), was formulated, with four core determinants of intention and usage, and up to four moderators of key relationships. UTAUT was then tested using the original data and found to outperform the eight individual models (adjusted R2 of 69 percent). UTAUT was then confirmed with data from two new organizations with similar results (adjusted R2 of 70 percent). UTAUT thus provides a useful tool for managers needing to assess the likelihood of success for new technology introductions and helps them understand the drivers of acceptance in order to proactively design interventions (including training, marketing, etc.) targeted at populations of users that may be less inclined to adopt and use new systems. The paper also makes several recommendations for future research including developing a deeper understanding of the dynamic influences studied here, refining measurement of the core constructs used in UTAUT, and understanding the organizational outcomes associated with new technology use.",https://doi.org/10.2307/30036540,article

Despite the benefits, prior works mainly focused on accurate detection and classification of utility poles, rather than pole inspection and maintenance through visual analytics. This paper presents a novel method to stream vision-based pole inspection information (i.e., maximum leaning angle of poles) into a virtual environment toward digital twin modeling in the context of power distribution infrastructure systems. By leveraging a single 2D image per pole obtained from a drone, the maximum leaning angle of utility poles over large areas are estimated. The outcomes of vision-based utility pole analysis are then fed into a virtual environment. For evaluation, case studies were conducted on Bryan, TX. The resulting digital twin model representing the stability information of utility poles has the potential to be used as a basis for better designing disaster preparedness and hazard mitigation strategies regarding the preventive maintenance of power distribution networks.",https://doi.org/10.1061/9780784482865.101,article

Each student with autism comes with her or his own unique needs and an array of behaviors and habits that can be severe and which interfere with everyday tasks. Autism is associated with intellectual disability, impairments in social skills, and physical health issues such as sleep and abdominal disturbances. We have designed an Internet-of-Things (IoT) framework named WearSense that leverages the sensing capabilities of modern smartwatches to detect stereotypic behaviors in children with autism. In this work, we present a study that used the inbuilt accelerometer of a smartwatch to detect three behaviors, including hand flapping, painting, and sibbing that are commonly observed in children with autism. In this feasibility study, we recruited 14 subjects to record the accelerometer data from the smartwatch worn on the wrist. The processing part extracts 34 different features in each dimension of the three-axis accelerometer, resulting in 102 features. Using and comparing various classification techniques revealed that an ensemble of 40 decision trees has the best accuracy of around 94.6%. This accuracy shows the quality of the data collected from the smartwatch and feature extraction methods used in this study. The recognition of these behaviors by using a smartwatch would be helpful in monitoring individuals with autistic behaviors, since the smartwatch can send the data to the cloud for comprehensive analysis and also to help parents, caregivers, and clinicians make informed decisions.",https://doi.org/10.3390/HEALTHCARE5010011,article

We examined the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation through personal computers, webcams, and a user-friendly interactive Internet interface had high adherence and a positive effect on cognitive function among older adults without dementia. Methods Daily 30-minute face-to-face communications were conducted during a 6-week trial period in the intervention group. The control group received only a weekly telephone interview. The cognitive status of normal subjects and those with mild cognitive impairment was operationally defined as a global clinical dementia rating of 0 and 0.5, respectively. Age, sex, education, mini mental state examination score, and clinical dementia rating score were balancing factors in randomization. The subjects were recruited using mass-mailing invitations. The pre- to postintervention differences in the cognitive test scores and loneliness scores were compared between the control and intervention groups using linear regression models. Results Eighty-three subjects participated (41 in the intervention group and 42 in the control group). Their mean ± standard deviation age was 80.5 ± 6.8 years. Adherence to the protocol was high. There was no dropout and mean percentage of days completed of the targeted trial days among the intervention group was 89% (range 77%-100%). Among the cognitively intact participants, the intervention group improved more than did the control group on a semantic fluency test (P =.003) at the post-trial assessment and a phonemic fluency test (P =.004) at the 18-week assessments. Among those with mild cognitive impairment, a trend (P =.04) toward improved psychomotor speed was observed in the intervention group. Conclusion Daily conversations by way of user-friendly Internet communication programs demonstrated high adherence. Among the cognitively intact, the intervention group showed greater improvement in tests of language-based executive functions. Increasing daily social contacts through communication technologies could offer cost-effective home-based prevention methods. Additional studies with a longer follow-up duration are required to examine whether the intervention slows cognitive declines and delays the onset of dementia.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.TRCI.2015.01.001,article

There is a shift in academic literature toward a socio-technical understanding of UDTs. What are the implications of the main findings? A socio-technical research and development agenda is proposed to bridge this gap: Augmented Urban Planning (AUP). It is necessary to consolidate a socio-technical methdology for development and use of UDTs within urban planning processes. Urban digital twins (UDTs) were first discussed in 2018. Seven years later, we ask: What has been their contribution to urban planning and decision making so far? Here, we systematically review 88 peer-reviewed articles to map and compare UDTs' ambitions with their realized contributions. Our results indicate that despite the vast technical developments, socio-technical challenges have remained largely unaddressed, causing many of UDTs' ambitions to remain unrealized. We identify three categories in these socio-technical challenges: interdisciplinary integration (II), consensual contextualization (CC), and procedural operationalization (PO).

In the 21st century, there has been a shift from sustainability assessment to smart city goals. We analyze 16 sets of city assessment frameworks (eight smart city and eight urban sustainability assessment frameworks) comprising 958 indicators altogether by dividing the indicators under three impact categories and 12 sectors. The following main observations derive from the analyses: as expected, there is a much stronger focus on modern technologies and “smartness” in the smart city frameworks compared to urban sustainability frameworks. Another observation is that as urban sustainability frameworks contain a large number of indicators measuring environmental sustainability, smart city frameworks lack environmental indicators while highlighting social and economic aspects. A general goal of smart cities is to improve sustainability with help of technologies. Thus, we recommend the use of a more accurate term “smart sustainable cities” instead of smart cities. However, the current large gap between smart city and sustainable city frameworks suggest that there is a need for developing smart city frameworks further or re-defining the smart city concept. We recommend that the assessment of smart city performance should not only use output indicators that measure the efficiency of deployment of smart solutions but also impact indicators that measure the contribution towards the ultimate goals such as environmental, economic or social sustainability.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.CITIES.2016.09.009,article

Conceptual considerations and empirical insights from India,"Smart City (SC) strategies that aim at fostering sustainable urban development through the systemic implementation of modern information and communication technologies (ICTs) continue to appeal to national and municipal governments despite of increasingly skeptical academic debates. Especially in Asian emerging economies aspirations to create SCs are widespread, yet seem hopelessly illusionary in many cases and might actually harm rather than benefit most citizens. This paper acknowledges these critical views, yet also accentuates constructive perspectives on SC achievements that offer rays of hope especially for cities in less developed countries. We propose to emphasize influential process qualities of SC strategies, which can instigate broader governance and institutional transformations locally, rather than mainly looking at the technical product features of final SC settings. Refined conceptual distinctions between the product and process view on achievable outcomes of SC schemes are suggested which also borrow from evolutionary geography perspectives. To illustrate our propositions, the example of India's Smart Cities Mission launched in 2015 is used. While the planned refurbishment of urban spaces in India is rightfully criticized by some, our own qualitative empirical research – a multiple case study analysis of five SC schemes in South India in spring 2018 – reveals several promising process qualities besides implementation deficiencies. Our study finds eight mechanisms of detrimental path dependency that obstruct SC progress, but also eight mechanisms of positive evolutionary change with respect to urban governance procedures. Making agents in emerging economies aware of these potential outcomes that reach beyond a mere urban technology focus can inspire more effective forthcoming SC strategies and policies.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.WORLDDEV.2019.104614,article

Exploring the stakeholders' opinions, priorities and perceived barriers in a medium-sized city in the United States","Many cities in the United States are pursuing agendas to implement ICT-based solutions to tackle urban challenges, thus achieving the ‘smart city' label. While the discussion on this urban development paradigm has revolved around the intensive use of technologies, the academic literature increasingly calls for shifting the focus to the people living in the cities. This paper argues that to achieve a people-centred smart city, cities should include the perspectives of all the local stakeholders. Under this assumption, this paper provides the views of the local stakeholders in a medium-sized city in Tennessee, Chattanooga. Particularly, this study explores their perceived smart city concept, the ethical standards that should guide smart city projects, the desired future projects in their community, and the barriers to implementing them. The data was collected using a combination of participatory budgeting, five focus groups, and twenty-eight interviews with city dwellers, entrepreneurs, university faculty, non-profit members, and government officials. The results suggest that, far from the image of a highly technological city, the stakeholders envision a city dedicated to improving the quality of life and environmental sustainability. Furthermore, to achieve this smart city, the projects need to be based on full transparency and the promotion of social inclusion. In contrast to the dominant trend towards the privatization of urban space, this study finds that the stakeholders prefer public based smart city projects such as ICT-based public transport services. However, its successful implementation will have to overcome the barriers caused by funding constraints, public acceptance, and political interests. Cities may use the results of this study to design more responsible smart city projects that strike an optimal point between citizen engagement and technological applications and innovations while supporting all stakeholders' needs. Highlights Stakeholders' opinions on smart city projects in Chattanooga were examined Chattanooga can be considered an example of a medium-sized smart city Public-based, transparent and socially inclusive projects are preferred Preferences on smart city projects varied across groups of stakeholders Including all city stakeholders' visions can reduce social cleavages.",https://doi.org/10.1080/12265934.2021.1968939,article

Yet the data revolution is so far primarily a technical one: the power of data to sort, categorise and intervene has not yet been explicitly connected to a social justice agenda by the agencies and authorities involved. Meanwhile, although data-driven discrimination is advancing at a similar pace to data processing technologies, awareness and mechanisms for combating it are not. This paper posits that just as an idea of justice is needed in order to establish the rule of law, an idea of data justice – fairness in the way people are made visible, represented and treated as a result of their production of digital data – is necessary to determine ethical paths through a datafying world. Bringing together the emerging scholarly perspectives on this topic, I propose three pillars as the basis of a notion of international data justice: (in)visibility, (dis)engagement with technology and antidiscrimination. These pillars integrate positive with negative rights and freedoms, and by doing so challenge both the basis of current data protection regulations and the growing assumption that being visible through the data we emit is part of the contemporary social contract.",https://doi.org/10.1177/2053951717736335,article

A clarification of concepts,"Though the concept of sustainable development originally included a clear social mandate, for two decades this human dimension has been neglected amidst abbreviated references to sustainability that have focused on bio-physical environmental issues, or been subsumed within a discourse that conflated 'development' and 'economic growth'. The widespread failure of this approach to generate meaningful change has led to renewed interest in the concept of 'social sustainability' and aspects thereof. A review of the literature suggests, however, that it is a concept in chaos, and we argue that this severely compromises its importance and utility. The purpose of this paper is to examine this diverse literature so as to clarify what might be meant by the term social sustainability and highlight different ways in which it contributes to sustainable development more generally. We present a threefold schema comprising: (a) 'development sustainability' addressing basic needs, the creation of social capital, justice and so on; (b) 'bridge sustainability' concerning changes in behaviour so as to achieve bio-physical environmental goals and; (c) 'maintenance sustainability' referring to the preservation - or what can be sustained - of socio-cultural characteristics in the face of change, and the ways in which people actively embrace or resist those changes. We use this tripartite of social sustainabilities to explore ways in which contradictions and complements between them impede or promote sustainable development, and draw upon housing in urban areas as a means of explicating these ideas. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.GEOFORUM.2011.01.002,article

A critical review of smart cities under climate change,"In recent years, smart cities have grown in popularity, both in research and in practice. The focus of smart city studies and policy initiatives has historically been on technology, particularly how information and communication technology can be leveraged to improve city functions. This focus has begun to shift towards sustainability, with many researchers calling for the development of smart, sustainable cities, which can aid efforts of climate change mitigation and adaptation. The connection between smart cities and climate change, however, is not clear. In this review article, we aim to synthesize the recent literature surrounding smart cities and climate change, and to discuss the benefits (or costs) of smart cities with regard to climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. In particular, we focus on five key aspects of urban resilience to climate change: infrastructure, public health and well-being, accessibility and equity, sustainable systems, and governance. The literature reveals a higher level of emphasis on infrastructure resilience to climate change than the other categories. Moreover, the research areas differ in the level of connection between smart city initiatives and climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts. For example, within the critical infrastructure research area, studies on smart energy systems focus on climate change mitigation, particularly reducing emissions, while studies on smart water systems emphasize adaptation to future floods and droughts. Going beyond the aforementioned research areas, we discuss the role of big data in smart cities, including the benefits and challenges associated with collecting large amounts of data from smart technology, as well as the techniques needed to analyze such data. Finally, we highlight future directions that we believe the research on smart cities needs to focus on, based on the results from our literature review.

This paper introduces a framework of critical components that constitute a successful livelihood recovery by studying the perceptions and perspectives of those affected by the 2013 Lushan earthquake in Sichuan Province. A mixed method, namely a pilot study, questionnaire survey and interviews, was used. While the populations surveyed valued the employment benefits of creating new market and economic sectors in areas where rural farming was predominant prior to the earthquake, they considered that recovery of their housing was most essential for livelihood diversification. External assistance was also regarded highly in assisting with livelihood recovery, in which family ties and social connections seemed to have played a larger role than that of government agencies and NGOs. Lastly, the results highlighted that a goal of livelihood recovery cannot be achieved without individual well-being being considered, in relation to people's perceptions about quality of life and their physical and mental health. This paper aims to assist the Chinese policy makers and practitioners in disaster recovery in setting an agenda of preparing for livelihood recovery in peace times, or of post-disaster recovery planning should a disaster event occurs so that the economic impact and livelihood burdens of those affected can be effectively mitigated.",https://doi.org/10.1007/S11069-020-04412-Y,article

This article analyses data as a form of capital that is distinct from, but has its roots in, economic capital. Data collection is driven by the perpetual cycle of capital accumulation, which in turn drives capital to construct and rely upon a universe in which everything is made of data. The imperative to capture all data, from all sources, by any means possible influences many key decisions about business models, political governance, and technological development. This article argues that many common practices of data accumulation should actually be understood in terms of data extraction, wherein data is taken with little regard for consent and compensation. By understanding data as a form capital, we can better analyse the meaning, practices, and implications of datafication as a political economic regime.",https://doi.org/10.1177/2053951718820549,article

The Roles of the Court and the Executive in Environmental Policymaking.,"Although there is general public approval of the improvements in Delhi's air quality in the recent years, the process by which this change was brought about has been criticized. A common perception is that air quality policies were prescribed by the Supreme Court, and not by an institution with the mandate for making environmental policy. A careful review of the policy process in Delhi suggests otherwise. We find that the government was intimately involved in policymaking and that the main role of the Supreme Court was to force the government to implement previously announced policies.

"Swapan, Mohammad Shahidul Hasan",2016.0,{Who participates and who doesn't? Adapting community participation model for developing countries,"In developing countries, the idea of community participation has been advocated largely by development scholars and practitioners inspired by western-based models. Such prescriptions for community participation focus largely on institutional reforms while ignoring social, political and psychological factors that also affect individuals' propensity to participate in the planning processes. Theoretical models that explain citizens' participation in the planning processes found in the extant literature do not adequately reflect the widespread realities of developing countries. Moreover, prior studies suggest that only few citizens, irrespective of diverse socio-economic background, have interest in participating in the planning process. Traditional participation spectrum views participation from a citizen activist's perspective and is, perhaps, sceptical of participation choices generated within current political context. In this article, it is contended that the rational decision-making employed by citizens in determining whether or not to be involved in the planning process defines the spectrum of participation. Reporting on a case study of the megacity - Dhaka - this article seeks to develop a community participation model that represents participants' realities as well as their aspiration to engage in decision-making and reflects the reasons for public apathy on participation. The empirical study identifies a range of social, political and psychological factors affecting an individual's attitude towards participation. These include an individual's lack of awareness, involvement in informal networks, discouraging perceptions about participation outcomes and most notably, lack of trust in the planning system. Citizens tend to avoid engaging in formal participation processes as the prevalent parallel system based on informal transactions with political leaders is perceived to be more effective than the formal planning system.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.CITIES.2016.01.013,article
"Dupuy, Kendra E. and Ron, James and Prakash, Aseem",2015.0,{Who survived? Ethiopia's regulatory crackdown on foreign-funded NGOs,"ABSTRACT: How do public regulations shape the composition and behavior of non-governmental organizations (NGOs)? Because many NGOs advocate liberal causes, such as human rights, democracy, and gender equality, they upset the political status quo. At the same time, a large number of NGOs operating in the Global South rely on international funding. This sometimes disconnects from local publics and leads to the proliferation of sham or ‘briefcase' NGOs. Seeking to rein in the politically inconvenient NGO sector, governments exploit the role of international funding and make the case for restricting the influence of NGOs that serve as foreign agents. To pursue this objective, states worldwide are enacting laws to restrict NGOs' access to foreign funding. We examine this regulatory offensive through an Ethiopian case study, where recent legislation prohibits foreign-funded NGOs from working on politically sensitive issues. We find that most briefcase NGOs and local human rights groups in Ethiopia have disappeared, while survivors have either ‘rebranded' or switched their work from proscribed areas. This research note highlights how governments can and do shape the population ecology of the non-governmental sector. Because NGOs seek legitimacy via their claims of grassroots support, a reliance on external funding makes them politically vulnerable. Any study of the NGO sector must include governments as the key component of NGOs' institutional environment.",https://doi.org/10.1080/09692290.2014.903854,article

However, the spread of smart homes has been slower than expected, and analysis of smart homes from a demand perspective is required. This study suggests implications for promoting the smart home market by analyzing factors affecting adoption and diffusion of smart homes. A technology acceptance model was used to describe the adoption of smart homes and a multivariate probit model was used to describe the diffusion of smart homes. The characteristics of smart homes such as network effects between services/products and the importance of personal information protection were considered in addition to demographic variables. The results of this study show that compatibility, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness have significant positive effects on purchase intention. In terms of purchase timing, unlike other information and communication technology (ICT) services/products, older consumers are more likely to purchase smart homes within a given time period than are younger consumers. Therefore, a strategy for promoting smart home purchases by young consumers is required to increase market demand.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2018.06.029,article

The shift to e-participation has impacted social participation mechanisms that were well-established in face-to-face formats. To analyze and understand the consequences of this transition, we employ a case study with inspiration ethnographic in the Porto Alegre Municipal Council for Urban and Environmental Development in Porto Alegre, Brazil. While e-participation has the potential to include individuals who were previously unable to participate in face-to-face meetings, it also presents limitations. A significant portion of the population lacks the digital literacy or appropriate devices necessary to engage effectively in online sessions. Moreover, when e-participation was first implemented, plenary sessions were broadcasted without giving viewers the right to express their opinions on the topics discussed. This situation highlights the need for a new framework that considers the process of transitioning from in-person participation to e-participation due to the constraints imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Reissig, Linda and Stoinescu, Andrei and Mack, Gabriele",2022.0,{Why farmers perceive the use of e-government services as an administrative burden: A conceptual framework on influencing factors,"In many countries around the world, family farms are expected to use e-government services to handle data exchange electronically via the internet with the government to fulfill their information obligations. This paper aims to explore the factors influencing the extent to which farmers perceive the use of such services as burdensome, and to develop a framework to categorize these factors for the farming sector. To do this, we extracted a conceptual framework designed for commercial businesses and adapted it to the farming sector. We employed a qualitative case study in Switzerland and conducted face-to-face interviews with six farmers using contrast sampling. The interviews were examined by applying thematic analysis. We found influencing factors from four different fields: (1) farm and farmer characteristics (e.g., farm structure, farmer's attitude toward ICT, farmer's ICT competence, use of external support, work organization, and infrastructure), (2) usage characteristics of e-government services (e.g. quantity and frequency of data entry, and period in use), (3) perceived characteristics of e-government (e.g., network, documentation, software design, complexity, farm compatibility, and duplication), and (4) perceived farm impact (data-security). We further found that the use of e-government services has no organizational benefits for family farms. Our findings provide a conceptual framework for understanding why e-government services for farmers might contribute to either a decrease or increase in their perceived administrative burden. It further provides policy-relevant information about the factors that play a role in digital direct payment administration to reduce farmers' administrative burdens.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2022.01.002,article

Decreasing influence of socioeconomic deprivation between 1981 and 2001 supports the existence of a 'Scottish Effect',"Objectives: To determine the degree to which changing patterns of deprivation in Scotland and the rest of Great Britain between 1981 and 2001 explain Scotland's higher mortality rates over that period. Design: Cross-sectional analyses using population and mortality data from around the 1981, 1991 and 2001 censuses. Setting: Great Britain (GB). Participants: Populations of Great Britain enumerated in the 1981, 1991 and 2001 censuses. Main outcome measures: Carstairs deprivation scores derived for wards (England and Wales) and postcode sectors (Scotland). Mortality rates adjusted for age, sex and deprivation decile. Results: Between 1981 and 2001 Scotland became less deprived relative to the rest of Great Britain. Age and sex standardized all-cause mortality rates decreased by approximately 25% across Great Britain, including Scotland but mortality rates were on average 12% higher in Scotland in 1981 rising to 15% higher in 2001. While over 60% of the excess mortality in 1981 could be explained by differences in deprivation profile, less than half the excess could be explained in 1991 and 2001. After adjusting for age, sex and deprivation, excess mortality in Scotland rose from 4.7% (95% CI: 3.9% to 5.4%) in 1981 to 7.9% (95% CI: 7.2% to 8.7%) in 1991 and 8.2% (95% CI: 7.4% to 9.0%) in 2001. All deprivation deciles showed excess indicating that populations in Scotland living in areas of comparable deprivation to populations in the rest of Great Britain always had higher mortality rates. By 2001 the largest excesses were found in the most deprived areas in Scotland with a 17% higher mortality rate in the most deprived decile compared to similarly deprived areas in England and Wales. Excess mortality in Scotland has increased most among males aged <65 years. Conclusions: Scotland's relative mortality disadvantage compared to the rest of Great Britain, after allowing for deprivation, is worsening. By 1991 measures of deprivation no longer explained most of the excess mortality in Scotland and the unexplained excess has persisted during the 1990s. More research is required to understand what is causing this 'Scottish effect'. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdi002,article

"Woodward, A. and Kawachi, I.",2000.0,{Why reduce health inequalities?,"It is well known that social, cultural and economic factors cause substantial inequalities in health. Should we strive to achieve a more even share of good health, beyond improving the average health status of the population? We examine four arguments for the reduction of health inequalities. 1 Inequalities are unfair. Inequalities in health are undesirable to the extent that they are unfair, or unjust. Distinguishing between health inequalities and health inequities can be contentious. Our view is that inequalities become ″unfair″ when poor health is itself the consequence of an unjust distribution of the underlying social determinants of health (for example, unequal opportunities in education or employment). 2 Inequalities affect everyone. Conditions that lead to marked health disparities are detrimental to all members of society. Some types of health inequalities have obvious spillover effects on the rest of society, for example, the spread of infectious diseases, the consequences of alcohol and drug misuse, or the occurrence of violence and crime. 3 Inequalities are avoidable. Disparities in health are avoidable to the extent that they stem from identifiable policy options exercised by governments, such as tax policy, regulation of business and labour, welfare benefits and health care funding. It follows that health inequalities are, in principle, amenable to policy interventions. A government that cares about improving the health of the population ought therefore to incorporate considerations of the health impact of alternative options in its policy setting process. 3 Interventions to reduce health inequalities are cost effective. Public health programmes that reduce health inequalities can also be cost effective. The case can be made to give priority to such programmes (for example, improving access to cervical cancer screening in low income women) on efficiency grounds. On the other hand, few programmes designed to reduce health inequalities have been formally evaluated using cost effectiveness analysis. We conclude that fairness is likely to be the most influential argument in favour of acting to reduce disparities in health, but the concept of equity is contested and susceptible to different interpretations. There is persuasive evidence for some outcomes that reducing inequalities will diminish ″spill over″ effects on the health of society at large. In principle, you would expect that differences in health status that are not biologically determined are avoidable. However, the mechanisms giving rise to inequalities are still imperfectly understood, and evidence remains to be gathered on the effectiveness of interventions to reduce such inequalities.",https://doi.org/10.1136/JECH.54.12.923,article
"Colding, Johan and Barthel, Stephan and S{\""{o",2019.0,{Wicked problems of smart cities,"It is often uncritically assumed that, when digital technologies are integrated into the operation of city functions, they inevitably contribute to sustainable urban development. Such a notion rests largely on the belief that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) solutions pave the way for more democratic forms of planning, and that ‘smart' technological devices result in a range of environmental benefits, e.g., energy efficiency and the mitigation of global warming. Drawing on the scientific literature that deals with ‘smart cities', we here elaborate on how both propositions fail to consider drawbacks that could be characterized as ‘wicked', i.e., problems that lack simplistic solutions and straightforward planning responses, and which often come about as ‘management surprises', as a byproduct of achieving sustainability. We here deal with problems related to public choice constraints, ‘non-choice default technologies' and the costs of automation for human learning and resilience. To avoid undemocratic forms of planning and too strong a dependence on non-choice default technologies, e.g., smart phones, we recommend that planners and policy makers safeguard redundancy in public-choice options by maintaining a wide range of alternative choices, including analog ones. Resilience thinking could help planners deal more effectively with the ‘wickedness' of an increasingly hyper-connected society.",https://doi.org/10.3390/SMARTCITIES2040031,article

The many positive attributes of networks are often featured - the capacity to solve problems, govern shared resources, create learning opportunities, and address shared goals - and a literature focused on the challenges networks pose for managers seeking to realize these network attributes is developing. The authors share an interest in understanding the potential of networks to govern complex public, or ""wicked,"" problems. A fundamental challenge to effectively managing any public problem in a networked setting is the transfer, receipt and integration of knowledge across participants. When knowledge is viewed pragmatically, the challenge is particularly acute. This perspective, the authors argue, presents a challenge to the network literature to consider the mind-set of the managers - or collaborative capacity-builders - who are working to achieve solutions to wicked problems. This mind-set guides network managers as they apply their skills, strategies, and tools in order to foster the transfer, receipt, and integration of knowledge across the network and, ultimately, to build long-term collaborative problem-solving capacity. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1540-6210.2007.00866.X,article

In this study, we used an experimental approach to compare decision making in three situations: humans making decisions (1) without any support of algorithms, (2) supported by business rules (BR), and (3) supported by machine learning (ML). Participants were asked to make the correct decisions given various scenarios, while BR and ML algorithms could provide correct or incorrect suggestions to the decision maker. This enabled us to evaluate whether the participants were able to understand the limitations of BR and ML. The experiment shows that algorithms help decision makers to make more correct decisions. The findings suggest that explainable AI combined with experience helps them detect incorrect suggestions made by algorithms. However, even experienced persons were not able to identify all mistakes. Ensuring the ability to understand and traceback decisions are not sufficient for avoiding making incorrect decisions. The findings imply that algorithms should be adopted with care and that selecting the appropriate algorithms for supporting decisions and training of decision makers are key factors in increasing accountability and transparency.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0894439320980118,article

Yet, the role of employees' literacy seems to be neglected in current literature. This paper aims to explore the roles that information and digital literacy play on the employees' perception in relation to usefulness and ease of use of digital technologies and consequently their intention to use technology in the practices they perform at the workplace. Design/methodology/approach: This paper builds a conceptual model with key constructs (information literacy and digital literacy) as new antecedents to the technology acceptance model and aims to establish that information literacy and digital literacy are indirect determinants of employees' intention to use digital technologies at the workplace. The data set used in this paper comprises of 121 respondents and structural equation modelling was used. Findings: The findings reveal that both information literacy and digital literacy have a direct impact on perceived ease of use of technology but not on the perceive usefulness. The findings also show that both literacies have an indirect impact on the intention to use digital technology at work via attitude towards use. Practical implications: Managers and decision-makers should pay close attention to the literacy levels of their staff. Because literacies are such an important skillset in the digital age, managers and chief information officers may want to start by identifying which work groups or individuals require literacy training and instruction, and then provide specific and relevant training or literacy interventions to help those who lack sufficient literacy.

These six challenges are described in detail along with the research direction to address them. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-03781-8_1,article
"Tamayo, Alain and Huerta, Joaqu{\'{i",2009.0,{gvSOS: A new Client for the OGC{\textregistered,"A key problem with sensor networks is achieving interoperability between different networks potentially built using different software and hardware platforms. Services interfaced by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) specifications allow GIS clients to access geospatial data without knowing the details about how these data are gathered or stored. Currently, OGC is working on a set of interoperable interfaces and metadata encodings known as Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) that enables the integration of heterogeneous sensor systems and measurements into geospatial information infrastructures. In this article we present the implementation of gvSOS, a new module for gvSIG to connect to Sensor Observation Services (SOS). The gvSOS client module allows gvSIG users to interact with SOS servers, displaying the information gathered by sensors as a layer composed by features. We present the software engineering development process followed to build the module. For each step of the process we specify the main obstacles found during the development such as restrictions of the gvSIG architecture, inaccuracies in the OGC specifications, and a set of common problems found in current SOS server implementations available on the Internet. For most of the problems found we propose a solution, or at least we present a path that might lead to it. {\textcopyright",https://doi.org/10.1111/J.1467-9671.2009.01160.X,article

Data collected from online social networks (OSN) provides social, economic, and cultural information which can be utilized by governments, policy makers, authorities and even commercial industries to better understand market trends and behavioral patterns, that can influence the individual dynamics through open data sources. OSN constitute a breeding ground for the spread of several risks and threats to privacy and security that affect participation and quality of life in smart cities. Although the aspects of privacy and security, and individuals' behavior in social networking are important for the successful development of smart cities, they have not been adequately discussed. To this end, this study aims to address this issue by revealing the risks, threats and individuals' behavior on OSN as an attempt to enhance privacy and security, and boost community's engagement in smart cities. Furthermore, a novel model which outlines the relationships between privacy and security threats, along with some effective countermeasures for the protection of OSN users in smart cities are proposed.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.TECHFORE.2018.10.026,article
"Lupton, Deborah and Michael, Mike",2017.0,{‘Depends on whos got the data': Public understandings of personal digital dataveillance,"Post-Snowden, several highly-publicised events and scandals have drawn attention to the use of people's personal data by other actors and agencies, both legally and illicitly. In this article, we report the findings of a project in which we used cultural probes to generate discussion about personal digital dataveillance. Our findings suggest the prevailing dominance of tacit assumptions about the uses and benefits of dataveillance as well as fears and anxieties about its possible misuse. Participants were able to identify a range of ways in which dataveillance is conducted, but were more aware of obvious commercial and some government actors. There was very little identification of the types of dataveillance that are used by national security and policing agencies or of illegal access by hackers and cybercriminals. We found that the participants recognised the value of both personal data and the big aggregated data sets that their own data may be part of, particularly for their own convenience. However, they expressed concern or suspicion about how these data may be used by others, often founded on a lack of knowledge about what happens to their data. The major question for our participants was where the line should be drawn. When does personal dataveillance become too intrusive, scary or creepy? What are its drawbacks and risks? Our findings suggest that experimenting with innovative approaches to elicit practices and understandings of personal digital data offers further possibilities for greater depth and breadth of social research with all types of social groups.",https://doi.org/10.24908/SS.V15I2.6332,article

I hate it!': Spatial practices of the urban poor in Calgary, Canada","Globalizing cities such as Calgary, Canada's center of the oil and gas industry, are confronted with increasing socio-spatial inequalities and uneven development. The aim of this paper is to comprehend poverty in the disadvantaged area of Greater Forest Lawn (GFL) in Calgary through everyday spatial practices of the urban poor and to examine how these practices are affected by urban developments in the area. We provide an in-depth ethnographic account of everyday routines and social conventions of people experiencing poverty in GFL. Our findings reveal how spatial practices that enable poor residents in GFL to meet basic needs are precariously balanced with many intersecting social, spatial, economic, and political structures. They also portray how many residents feel new developments in the area attempt to hide the presence of poverty by oppressing the undesirable aspects associated with it. Consequently, GFL as a social space is increasingly torn between the spatial practices of those trying to cope with poverty and the urban development which imposes a spatial code of desirability and consumption. Consequently, we see urban development in the case of GFL as oppressive and recommend a shift from thinking about urban development in terms of desirability and profitability to becoming more aware of and involved in local practices. Overall, we argue that the right to the city includes the right to urban development in harmony with one's own everyday spatial practices.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.GEOFORUM.2020.10.002,article

"Baumgartner, Antonia and Rohrbach, Tobias and Sch{\""{o",2023.0,"{‘If the phone were broken, I'd be screwed': media use of people with disabilities in the digital era","Digital media have become integral to the everyday life of people with disabilities. So far, research about disability and digital media use is rather scarce and narrowed on issues of accessibility and social media. This paper draws on qualitative interviews with people with visual or motoric impairments to provide an in-depth analysis of their everyday experiences relating to barriers and benefits of digital media. The findings reproduce previously identified barriers and extend these by adding novel sub-aspects of individual cognitive and attitudinal barriers like non-use of digital media due to their (perceived) complexity and a feeling of greater dependence on digital technology. However, the results also shed light on highly individualized ways that people with disabilities actively make use of digital media to improve their daily life. Despite persisting and new barriers, the general findings suggest that, with the appropriate training and support, digital media are largely beneficial. Points of interest About 15 percent of the population worldwide are directly concerned by the issue of disability and digital media (for example smartphones, apps, online news). In this study, forty people with visual or motoric impairments were interviewed about their everyday experiences with digital media. They reported both benefits and problems of digital technology. Benefits: digital media allow people with disabilities to lead a more independent life; for example, shopping without assistance, reading the newspaper, or using social media. Problems: fear of technology, feeling dependent on digital devices, and lack of know-how are obstacles for digital media use. Increasingly complex websites and apps create additional barriers. A solution would be individual support and training.",https://doi.org/10.1080/09687599.2021.1916884,article
"Edwards-Schachter, M{\'{o",2017.0,"{‘Shaken, but not stirred': Sixty years of defining social innovation","This paper examines the evolution in the conceptualization of Social Innovation (SI) with a view to elucidating the multiplication of uses of the term over the last half century. We performed a comprehensive and systematic literature review extracting 252 definitions of SI through a search of 2,339 documents comprising academic papers, books and book chapters, together research and policy reports. To guide the inductive analysis of pluri-vocal discourses we assume innovation to be a learning-based process involving actors' interactions and social practices. We apply mixed qualitative methodologies, combining content analysis based on an interpretivist ontology with cognitive mapping techniques. Our findings show that SI was introduced as an analytical concept by incipient academic communities and has spread in the last decades as a normative concept fuelled by development and innovation policies. SI is defined by a set of common core elements underpinning three different and interrelated discursive ‘areas': processes of social change, sustainable development and the services sector. We point to some policy implications and a number of promising avenues for research towards the advancement of a broader socio-technical theory of innovation.",https://doi.org/10.1016/J.TECHFORE.2017.03.012,article

A media for immersive learning, metaverse could set future educational trends and lead to significant reform in education. Although the metaverse has the potential to improve the effectiveness of online learning experiences, metaverse-based educational implementations are still in their infancy. Additionally, what factors impact higher education students' adoption of the educational metaverse remains unclear. Consequently, the aim of this study is to explore the main factors that affect higher education students' behavioral intentions to adopt metaverse technology for education. This study has proposed an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to achieve this aim. The novelty of this study resides in its conceptual model, which incorporates both technological, personal, and inhibiting/enabling factors. The empirical data were collected via online questionnaires from 574 students in both private and public universities in Jordan. Based on the PLS-SEM analysis, the study identifies perceived usefulness, personal innovativeness in IT, and perceived enjoyment as key enablers of students' behavioral intentions to adopt the metaverse. Additionally, perceived cyber risk is found as the main inhibitor of students' metaverse adoption intentions. Surprisingly, the effect of perceived ease of use on metaverse adoption intentions is found to be insignificant. Furthermore, it is found that self-efficacy, personal innovativeness, and perceived cyber risk are the main determinants of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. While the findings of this study contribute to the extension of the TAM model, the practical value of these findings is significant since they will help educational authorities understand each factor's role and enable them to plan their future strategies.",https://doi.org/10.1007/S10639-023-11816-3,article

While the survival rates for BC are over 90% in many high-income countries; low-and middle-income countries like Nigeria have 40% BC survival rates. Prior studies show that the burden and poor BC survival rates are exacerbated by both health system and individual level factors, yet there is a paucity of literature on the experiences of BC survivors in Nigeria. Hence, this study explored the divergent and convergent experiences of BC survivors in accessing, navigating, and coping with treatment. Methods: Participants (N = 24, aged 35 to 73 years) were recruited and engaged in focus group discussions (group 1, n = 11; group 2, n = 13 participants). Transcripts were transcribed verbatim and analyzed with inductive thematic analysis. Results: Four themes were identified: “I am carrying this [breast cancer] alone,” “Living my life,” “‘God' helped me,” and “A very painful journey.” Participants described how they concealed their BC diagnosis from family and significant others while accessing and navigating BC treatment. Also, they adopted spiritual beliefs as a coping mechanism while sticking to their treatment and acknowledging the burden of BC on their well-being. Conclusions: Our findings explored the emotional burden of BC diagnosis and treatment and the willingness of the BC survivors to find meaning in their diagnosis. Treatment for BC survivors should integrate supportive care and innovative BC access tools to reduce pain and mitigate the burdens of BC. Implications for cancer survivors: The integration of innovative technologies for venous access and other treatment needs of BC is crucial and will improve survivorship. Non-disclosure of BC diagnosis is personal and complicated; hence, BC survivors need to be supported at various levels of care and treatment to make meaningful decisions. To improve survivorship, patient engagement is crucial in shared decision-making, collaboration, and active participation in care.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-024-08316-6,article
"Ferraris, Alberto and Santoro, Gabriele and Pellicelli, Anna Claudia",2020.0,{“Openness” of public governments in smart cities: removing the barriers for innovation and entrepreneurship,"Open innovation practices have been found to positively affect innovation and entrepreneurship due to the complementarities and uniqueness of resources and knowledge provided by each organization. Today, this approach may be even more important in the so called “smart cities”, where different private and public stakeholders cooperate to co-design and co-develop new cutting edge products and services aimed to create shared value through entrepreneurial behaviors. However, concrete examples of smart city projects revealed that public governments often do not have the necessary capabilities as well as innovative approaches to collaborate with companies and other stakeholders' ecosystems. So, this paper aims at analyzing (open) innovation in public governments shedding lights on the barriers and challenges that public governments face in smart city development. The study uses primary data gathered through interviews from multiple smart city stakeholders to highlight how public governments should operate in the smart city context to overcome barriers and challenges, and to favor an entrepreneurial and innovation ecosystem as well as public-private collaborations. These barriers are related to: lack of rules; as all the others tasks and responsibility; scarce integrated view of the city planning; lack of fit of administrative styles & interdepartmental coordination and communication; risk adversity; data availability; disincentives & non flexible public procurement rules; lack of resources; lack of technological capabilities. Moreover, the study provides contributions for different and interrelated streams of research, in particular developing several implications in the field of entrepreneurship and smart city.",https://doi.org/10.1007/S11365-020-00651-4,article
