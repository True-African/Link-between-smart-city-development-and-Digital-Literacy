abstract = {The digital divide refers to the gap among citizens of a country or across borders due to the lack of ease of access to digital means for some and the difficulty for others. The possession of electronic gadgets, smooth internet connectivity, and other forms of digital communication can have a wide gap in availability among countries. This gap is mostly influenced by factors that are of infrastructural, political, cultural, demographical, generational, and socioeconomic nature. On account of developed and developing countries, the gap is disseminated and thoroughly complex. Although the developed nations around the globe proved to have narrowed digital divide as a major source of development and advancement in respective countries, it is quite challenging for emerging economies to adhere to the same processes for development. For an emerging economy, the prudent cost-benefit analysis carried out by the government can have varying effects on undertaking projects related to minimizing the digital divide. Nevertheless, the importance of narrowing the gap of the digital divide is unparalleled, and governments of emerging economies are realizing the benefits of it and investing their resources accordingly. Furthermore, information technology can be a catalyst in facilitating processes that save a lot of costs, bring holistic quality improvements, and implement effective and efficient government policies that lead to digitalization and sustainable consumption of resources. Consequently, governments are getting actively involved in the digitalization of their respective countries to turn their smart cities into more intelligent ones. Even so, it is important to understand that taking one policy to address all citizens is not realistic. Hence, understanding the foundational knowledge of the citizens, the demand of the population under various sectors, framing well-rounded policies with alternatives, and effectively and efficiently implementing them are extremely crucial.},

abstract = {Purpose An IT rationalist discourse predominates in the e-government literature. Furthermore, and whenever an alternative and holistic discourse is developed, e-government evaluation remains mechanistic. E-inclusion is rightfully advocated as a socially inclusive strategy for e-government planning and development but it is erroneously considered as a further stage of e-government development, following the fourth and transactional stage. The paper aims to reconfigure e-government and e-inclusion as two parallel processes of government intervention to support a socially inclusive development strategy through a national IT strategy. Design/methodology/approach This paper reviews the general discourse surrounding e-government development and implementation, highlighting its mechanistic underpinnings and contrasting it with an inclusive approach to e-government. The mechanistic discourse of e-government is analyzed through key constructs that underlie the e-government concept. Vision and objectives, e-government evaluation, e-government models and the enabling role of ICT will be analyzed in view of sorting out the predominance of a mechanistic theme in their elaboration. The synthesis part of this work introduces e-inclusion based on a more organic and community-centered approach to e-government in light of the insufficiencies earlier identified. Findings Whilst e-inclusion provides a good platform to pinpoint insufficiencies of the predominant mechanistic approach to e-government, it remains doubtful whether it could be achieved within the realm of e-government programs alone. Practical implications Models, roadmaps and strategies for e-inclusion should explicitly outline the premises for a socially inclusive e-government and not consider e-inclusion as a further and mechanical stage of the e-government stage model. E-government evaluation has to pinpoint the inclusion aspects of existing projects by going beyond mechanistic measurements. Originality/value This paper questions a major assumption in the e-government literature, namely that e-inclusion follows e-government. By drawing from the political science literature, it identifies a niche for e-inclusion which helps reconceptualize it as socially inclusive government rather than a further stage of e-government. {\textcopyright} 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

abstract = {Sustainable development is a concern and a challenge of modern societies, either in developing and developed countries. Good governance is crucial to managing efficiently all kind of resources, including natural resources, for the well-being of current and future generations. Digital transformation can be a key driver of changes in governments if they want to enhance transparency, accountability and efficiency. E-government facilitates integrated policies and public services to promote sustainable and inclusive economic growth, social development and environmental protection. E-government contributes to efficient resource management, and so can help to improve namely natural resource usage in the present to avoid damage to their usage in the future. The aim of this study is to analyse the impact of e-government on sustainable development. Using a logit model, for a sample of 103 countries in the period 2003–2018, the results suggest that e-government development is a positive determinant for a country to attain sustainable development, proxied by adjusted net savings, that embraces a country's economic, social and environmental development. This study provides evidence that e-government increases the probability to attain sustainable development mostly in developing and transition economies. The results also suggest that economic growth and gross national income per capita are significant positive influences in sustainable development in the whole sample and that countries with lower age dependency and natural resource rents are more likely to have sustainable development. Developing e-government allows promoting sustainable development, particularly in developing and in transition economies.},

abstract = {Purpose This study aimed to identify and analyse the key factors influencing the adoption of e-government services and to discern their implications for various stakeholders, from policymakers to platform developers. Design/methodology/approach Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and detailed analysis of multiple studies, this research organised the influential factors based on their effect: highest, direct and indirect. The study also integrated findings to present a consolidated view of e-government adoption drivers. Findings The research found that users' behaviour, attitude, optimism bias and subjective norms significantly shape their approach to e-government platforms. Trust in e-Government (TEG) emerged as a critical determinant, with security perceptions being of paramount importance. Additionally, non-technical factors, such as cultural, religious and social influences, play a substantial role in e-government adoption decisions. The study also highlighted the importance of performance expectancy, effect expectancy and other determinants influencing e-government adoption. Originality/value While numerous studies have explored e-government adoption, this research offers a novel classification based on the relative effects of each determinant. Integrating findings from diverse studies and emphasising non-technical factors introduce an interdisciplinary approach, bridging the gap between information technology and fields like sociology, anthropology and behavioural sciences. This integrative lens provides a fresh perspective on the topic, encouraging more holistic strategies for enhancing e-government adoption globally.},

We live in an era of datafication, one in which life is increasingly quantified and transformed into intelligence for private or public benefit. When used responsibly, this offers new opportunities for public good. The potential of data is evident in the possibilities offered by open data and data collaboratives - both instances of how wider access to data can lead to positive and often dramatic social transformation. However, three key forms of asymmetry currently limit this potential, especially for already vulnerable and marginalized groups: data asymmetries, information asymmetries, and agency asymmetries. These asymmetries limit human potential, both in a practical and psychological sense, leading to feelings of disempowerment and eroding public trust in technology. Existing methods to limit asymmetries (such as open data or consent) as well as some alternatives under consideration (data ownership, collective ownership, personal information management systems) have limitations to adequately address the challenges at hand. A new principle and practice of digital self-determination (DSD) is therefore required. The study and practice of DSD remain in its infancy. The characteristics we have outlined here are only exploratory, and much work remains to be done so as to better understand what works and what does not. We suggest the need for a new research framework or agenda to explore DSD and how it can address the asymmetries, imbalances, and inequalities - both in data and society more generally - that are emerging as key public policy challenges of our era.},

abstract = {Background: Smartphones not only function as a means of communication between communities but also increase access to information and health services. However, this is faced with the challenge of a global digital divide in the use of these devices between generations. Even though the younger generation easily uses digital technology, the older generation generally does not understand technology. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to cell phone and mobile application utilization among Indonesian urban older adults in relation to the use of mobile health applications. Method: This was a cross-sectional study on community-dwelling older adult individuals aged 60 years or older in Jakarta, Indonesia, between August and November 2020. Results: Overall, 95 out of the 109 older adults (87.16%) had used cell phones during the past month. In practice, we found that 53% of older adults used cell phones to browse online health information; however, the percentage of health application users was still low (16%). The main problem these individuals faced when using cell phones was difficulties related to learning to use mobile apps (51%). Only a small number of older adults (19%) learn how to use cell phones by themselves. There was a significant association between the level of education and the need for assistance from others in using cell phones (p=0.005), between the method employed to learn how to use a cell phone and sex (p=0.043) and age (p=0.036). Conclusion: Indonesian urban older adults have tended to start embracing digital life. Family members play an important role in teaching technology skills to older adults. In addition, the higher the education level of an older adult subject, the more independent he or she was in using a cell phone. Method on how to use a cell phone by self-learning was associated with male sex and younger age (<75 years old). There is a need to improve the number of mobile health application users and eHealth literacy.},

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has not only caused a worldwide health crisis, but it has also deepened existing inequalities, and “has exacerbated the vulnerability of the least protected in society” (United Nations, 2020). Nowadays, there are many population groups that would be regarded as vulnerable. In daily life, citizens deal with a wide range of issues—social injustices, social marginalization and lack of impartiality—due to many reasons: culture, class, ethnicity, race, ideology, religion, gender, etc. To respond effectively to this problem—as the United Nations proposes in the goal 10 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)—we first need to understand and clearly define the phenomenon of vulnerable people, and how digital inclusion could represent an asset to help vulnerable people to bridge inequalities. There is no commonly agreed typology framework, and specific categorization criteria as a basis to assist the further investigation of the area. Our work is focused on filling this gap. In doing so, our contribution is twofold. First, we conduct a systematic review of the literature (N = 331 studies) providing an overview of the overall definitions, trends, patterns, and developments that characterize the research on vulnerable people and digital inclusion. Second, we propose a taxonomy to frame the phenomenon of vulnerable people and digital inclusion. The categorization criteria can promote and support further multidisciplinary research to study and explore the relation existing between vulnerable people and digital inclusion.},

abstract = {Purpose: This integrative review was conducted to provide an overview of existing research on digital (in)equity and the digital divide in developed countries. Design/methodology/approach: We searched academic and grey literature to identify relevant papers. From 8464 academic articles and 183 grey literature, after two levels of screening, 31 articles and 54 documents were selected, respectively. A thematic analysis was conducted following the steps suggested by Braun and Clarke and results were reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Findings: The results showed that most articles and papers were either from Europe or North America. Studies used a range of research methods, including quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods. The results demonstrated four major dimensions of the digital divide among various vulnerable groups, including digital literacy, affordability, equity-deserving group-sensitive content and availability or access to infrastructure. Among vulnerable groups, low-income people were reported in the majority of the studies followed by older adults, racial and ethnic minorities, newcomers/new immigrants and refugees, Indigenous groups, people with disabilities and women. Most reported barriers included lack of access to the internet, digital skills, language barriers and internet costs. Originality/value: To the best of our knowledge, there have been limited attempts to thoroughly review the literature to better understand the emerging dimensions of digital equity and the digital divide, identifying major vulnerable populations and their unique barriers and challenges. This review demonstrated that understanding intersectional characteristics (age, gender, disability, race, ethnicity, Indigenous identity and immigration status) and their interconnections is crucial for analyzing the dynamics of digital (in)equity and divide.},

Notwithstanding, rustic and minimized networks keep on confronting huge difficulties in getting to these computerized administrations. Key hindrances incorporate restricted advanced foundation, low degrees of computerized proficiency, socio-social opposition, and lacking strategy support, which by and large prevent the fruitful execution of e-governance in these locales. This paper hopes to break down the specific obstacles to e-governance gathering in underserved networks, recognizing fundamental factors that add to the high-level division. The audit studies existing composition on mechanized thought, context-oriented examinations, and best deals with, uncovering understanding into the remarkable necessities of common locales in changing in accordance with an electronic organization model. To connect these holes, this exploration proposes a bunch of methodologies for working on computerized consideration, including the foundation of local area focused computerized framework, designated advanced proficiency programs, and socially versatile e-governance models. Besides, it proposes strategy proposals that focus on impartial admittance to e-governance, accentuating the significance of comprehensive policymaking in engaging underserved populaces. By tending to these boundaries, the review means to add to a more comprehensive computerized scene where e-governance fills in as a device for financial improvement in all networks, paying little heed to geographic or financial status. This exploration offers a complete structure to direct future e-administration drives and computerized consideration endeavors in provincial and minimized regions, advancing reasonable and comprehensive development in the advanced age. </p>},

abstract = {The role of technology and importance of access to high-speed broadband has become glaringly obvious during the COVID-19 pandemic. High-speed Internet is a tool people rely upon to conduct the daily business of their life and interact with each other, the economy, and government. However, millions of people in the USA still have no home access to high-speed Internet. Low-income, people of color, older, Native Americans, and rural residents in particular are on the wrong side of the digital divide. This structural reality perpetuates social, economic, and political disparities. Consistent with a social work human rights approach, the United Nations General Assembly declared access to the Internet a basic human right in 2016. This calls upon social workers to engage in advocacy efforts to advance policy and programs to alleviate the digital divide. In this article, we examine the digital divide in the USA and discuss why it is a social justice and human rights issue. We provide a policy context and recent examples of state or local policy initiatives to reduce the digital divide. Prominent among them is California's Internet for All Now Act. We also identify and share promising practices and advocacy tools being used in the field that provide guidance to community practitioners as they engage in work at state and local levels aimed at closing the digital divide.},

abstract = {The Italian public administration (PA) has always had problems with slowness and inefficiency. In 2021, the Italian government made a massive investment in digitizing PA as part of an extraordinary recovery plan, with more than 200 billion euro to revitalize the country. This paper aims to investigate how educational inequalities affect the relationship between Italian citizens and PA in this phase of the digital transition. The study is based on a web survey conducted in March and April 2022 among a national sample of 3,000 citizens aged 18–64. The data shows that more than three-quarters of respondents have already used a public service at least once via an online channel. Few are aware of the reform plan, however, and more than one-third fear that the digitization of public services will make things worse for citizens. Through a regression analysis, the study confirms the centrality of the influence of education on the use of digital public services compared to the other spatial and social variables considered. Trust in PA is also correlated with education and employment status and is higher among those who have used digital public services. The survey thus highlights that the educational and cultural dimension is a crucial aspect as a lever to counter the digital divide and promote digital citizenship rights. It reveals the need to activate facilitation and accompaniment processes for citizens with less digital skills and experience who risk being excluded or penalized by the new arrangement and having their distrust toward the PA and state exacerbated.},

This study aims to highlight critical trends and knowledge gaps in the current literature and offers insights into how e-governance can contribute to achieving SDGs. Additionally, it provides policy recommendations and suggests future research directions to enhance governance practices. While this research significantly advances understanding of e-governance's role in sustainable development, it is limited by its reliance on a single database and narrow search terms, which may constrain the comprehensiveness of the findings. Expanding the scope of future research to include multiple databases and broader search terms is recommended to provide a more holistic view of the field.},

abstract = {E-government services are essential to societies because they save time, reduce corruption, provide efficient, low-cost, and fast service, increase transparency, and enhance trust in the government. These applications save time, which translates to cost savings by reducing bureaucratic crowds and fatigue and eliminating the need for citizens to travel for offline transactions. This study investigates various factors related to citizens' use of e-government services according to gender differences during and before COVID-19. The microdata set from the Survey on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Usage in Households conducted by TURKSTAT in 2018 and 2021 was used. Additionally, the binary logistic regression method was employed to analyze these factors. According to the research results, it has been determined that variables such as age, education level, occupation, e-commerce use, internet financial transaction status, number of people in the household, and region are associated with women's use of e-government services during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study found that the significance and impact of these variables on the use of e-government services differ based on the gender of individuals and the periods. The study provides recommendations for IT professionals, staff of the interior ministries, and researchers interested in increasing the use of e-government services. This research may also pioneer efforts to identify priority areas for expanding e-government services.},

Through data collection involving remote interviews (n=11) and online surveys (n=66), we expose claimants' own lived experiences interacting with this system. The claimants explain how digital channels can contribute to an imbalance of power and agency, at a time when their own circumstances mean they have reduced abilities, resources and capacities, and where design choices can adversely affect people's utility to leverage help from their own wider socio-technical ecosystems. We contribute eight recommendations from these accounts to inform the future design and development of digital welfare benefit systems for this population, to reduce digital barriers and harms.},

The researcher used means, standard deviations the results of the study shows there is impact of using Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) in the educational process on teachers, students, principles and parent. 1-1 Introduction Many studies have reviewed the significant impact of technology in learning in universities and universities as well as impact Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) in the educational process in universities and universities; these studies concluded that professors s and students supporting comprehensive approaches can help producing positive outcomes. The approaches used include appropriate policies, infrastructure, professional development, and curricula of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) in the educational process. Nonetheless, a large body of research evidence, there are no longitudinal, randomized trials conclusively linking e-Learning with positive learner outcomes. Speculations may range between economics and ethics. This research shows the impact of Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) in the educational process and how the technology-rich environment that delivers greater impacts. Professors s in any Educational institution as universities or universities, face some difficulties with their students, however various studies have proved that Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) in the educational process can increase student engagement, motivation, and their attendance as well. Effective Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) in the educational process can support professors improve their performance in lectures or classes and foster the development of the 21st century skills. Improvements of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have affected society as a whole, especially the educational sector, where in higher education and universities; applying ICTs in the form of e-learning is significantly changing teaching and learning processes. There are countless didactic and socio-economic aspects that have driven higher learning institutions to adopt Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) in the educational process as a teaching method. The application of using Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) in the educational process in our case would help professors s provide greater information access for their students, greater communication using electronic facilities, and increase their cooperation and collaboration. The using Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) in the educational process also provides pedagogical improvement through simulations in the lectures and classes, virtual experiences, and graphical representations. Both professors and the students are capable of choosing the most suitable and appropriate applications, which are more flexible in time and place, personalized, reusable, and adapted to specific domains, nevertheless it is cost effective and cost efficient (Fisser, 2001; Pelliccione, 2001). 1-2 Problem statement In order to draw attention to the using Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) in the educational process which is Implementation in universities and universities, it is constructive to comprehend how universities transformed themselves from the traditional model to the current emerging knowledge age where their activities are conducted mostly online. The mission of teaching is provide all the components that facilitate learning, and that professors can do his job with psychological stability, fulfill his needs and make him able to do his/ her best in a pleasure environment (Goodison, 2002). In this century, Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) is now part and parcel of learning, it is unclear as to how it is being employed i.e. specifically what exactly is happening. The organization of the ICT system is a heavy asset in terms of the financial, human and time resources employed to set it up and keep it going. How then can it be justice? It is necessary to know the influence of using Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) in the educational process (Kachepa and Batchaeva, 2008).},

abstract = {Project managers from both the public and private sectors have always known that better project management is often synonymous with better risk management. As such, all projects are subject to risk factors that make their management more or less complicated. In this article, we contend that successful project managers need tools to better identify and assess project risks and we try to provide such a tool in the form of grid of specific risk factors. This article analyzes risk factors in IT projects conducted using public–private partnership (PPP) procurement from the public partner's perspective. Our research uses, as empirical case studies, three projects undertaken by the Tunisian government in partnership with IT and engineering companies. The results reveal 13 specific risk factors, which are classified into three generic risk factor categories: strategic, operational, and key resources. The adverse effects of risks materializing are also identified and analyzed.},

abstract = {Growing urbanization trends, together with a greater environmental awareness, are transforming cities into game changers in the sustainability game. Cities are under pressure in both developed as well as developing economies. In developed countries, the challenge is to be able to tackle a lack of infrastructure, such as clean water and sanitation and mass transit transport systems. In developed countries, the challenges are distinct, but not less. There are growing needs for a renewal of infrastructures, such as water, transportation and energy systems, which deteriorate over time, and the related increasing challenges regarding the sustainability of the systems. Drivers of change include lower costs, greater levels of efficiency, better response to natural disasters (resilience), an ability to provide a good service, among others. Cities, regulators and operators are focused on improving innovation and develop truly smart cities and smart infrastructure. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) have been at the forefront of infrastructure development and management, however, questions exist regarding existing models which are usable for smart infrastructure. Our thesis is that existing models of PPP need to be significantly restructured, to be able to provide an adequate response to the smart infrastructure challenges and to be a driving force to make cities smarter. Greater flexibility is necessary, as is a profound change of the existing regulatory and procurement models, in order to ensure that the private sector will continue to have a pivotal role with regards to infrastructure, financing and management.},

abstract = {Objectives To assess the utility of an acronym, place of residence, race/ethnicity/culture/language, occupation, gender/sex, religion, education, socioeconomic status, and social capital ("PROGRESS"), in identifying factors that stratify health opportunities and outcomes. We explored the value of PROGRESS as an equity lens to assess effects of interventions on health equity. Study Design and Setting We assessed the utility of PROGRESS by using it in 11 systematic reviews and methodological studies published between 2008 and 2013. To develop the justification for each of the PROGRESS elements, we consulted experts to identify examples of unfair differences in disease burden and an intervention that can effectively address these health inequities. Results Each PROGRESS factor can be justified on the basis of unfair differences in disease burden and the potential for interventions to reduce these differential effects. We have not provided a rationale for why the difference exists but have attempted to explain why these differences may contribute to disadvantage and argue for their consideration in new evaluations, systematic reviews, and intervention implementation. Conclusion The acronym PROGRESS is a framework and aide-memoire that is useful in ensuring that an equity lens is applied in the conduct, reporting, and use of research. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.

However, what ‘citizen-centric' means in practice is rarely articulated. We draw on and extend Sherry Arnstein's seminal work on participation in planning and renewal programmes to create the ‘Scaffold of Smart Citizen Participation'—a conceptual tool to unpack the diverse ways in which the smart city frames citizens. We use this scaffold to measure smart citizen inclusion, participation, and empowerment in smart city initiatives in Dublin, Ireland. Our analysis illustrates how most ‘citizen-centric' smart city initiatives are rooted in stewardship, civic paternalism, and a neoliberal conception of citizenship that prioritizes consumption choice and individual autonomy within a framework of state and corporate defined constraints that prioritize market-led solutions to urban issues, rather than being grounded in civil, social and political rights and the common good. We conclude that significant normative work is required to rethink ‘smart citizens' and ‘smart citizenship' and to remake smart cities if they are to truly become ‘citizen-centric'.},

Whilst acknowledging the value of the thesis as an analytical framework in opening the way to innovative understandings of contemporary urban dynamics, the paper argues that, taken together, the articles in this themed issue seriously challenge the "splintering urbanism" thesis theoretically, empirically and methodologically. They question in particular the postulated universality of the "modern infrastructural ideal" and of "unbundling" and "bypass" processes - all of which are key elements in Graham and Marvin's argument - as well as the assertion that reforms in infrastructure sectors should generally result in more discriminatory, socially regressive patterns of provision of essential services and more splintered urban spaces. Based on these fundamental critiques, the paper concludes that one cannot speak of "splintering urbanism in general" - i.e., as a global trend - in any meaningful analytical way. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Our analysis shows that the majority of studies focus on the OGD provisions while assuming, but not empirically testing, various forms of utilization. The paper synthesizes the hypothesized relations in a multi-dimensional framework of OGD utilization. Based on the framework we suggest four future directions for research: 1) investigate the link between type of utilization and type of users (e.g. journalists, citizens) 2) investigate the link between type of user and type of effect (e.g. societal, economic and good governance benefits) 3) investigate the conditions that moderate OGD effects (e.g. policy, data quality) and 4) establishing a causal link between utilization and OGD outcomes.},

@article{Viitanen2014,
abstract = {Climate change and advances in urban technology propel forward the 'smart city'. As decision makers strive to find a technological fix, smart city strategies are often based on technological orthodoxies which are conceptually and empirically shallow. The motivation behind this paper is to address the conceptual adolescence which relates to the wholesale digitisation of the city by pursuing a twin argument about the democratic and environmental consequences. The authors draw on interdisciplinary theory and insights from urban studies, infrastructure, informatics, and the sociology of the Internet to critique the way the 'smart city' is taken forward. It is concluded that private firms market smart city services and solutions based on an ideological legacy of 'ubiquitous computing', 'universal infrastructure', and 'green technology'. Based on evidence from three UK cities-Manchester, Birmingham, and Glasgow-it is argued that the underlying principle of future city strategies is to expand the market for new technology products and services to support 'green growth' with disregard for their wider impacts. For citizens, becoming a consumer of the technologies is often presented as progressive 'participation' or 'empowerment' with unknown or hidden consequences both political and environmental. The city systems become a digital marketplace where citizen-consumers' participation is increasingly involuntary and the hegemony of global technology firms is inflated. What follows is that the city's 'intelligent systems' are defined through a digital consumer experience that has inherent biases and leaves parts of the city and its population unaccounted for. This renders the city less resilient in the face of future social and climatic risks. {\textcopyright} 2014 Pion and its Licensors.},

However, existing research does not provide a clear picture of how this smart city agenda actually contributes to sustainability. The social science literature has been critical toward urban smartness, with most of the empirical research focusing on the politics of data-driven and entrepreneurial urbanism. This article seeks to contribute to this debate by empirically examining the role that sustainability plays in the smart city discourse. Its distinctive approach is to investigate how urban smartness and sustainability are framed by an authoritative institution (the European Union) and then to trace these framings down to a particular city (Stavanger, Norway). The data show that the smartness approach is strongly tied to innovation, technology, and economic entrepreneurialism, and sustainability does not appear to be a very important motivating driver. Nevertheless, the ‘sustainability component' of the smart city agenda becomes clearer the closer we come to the city level.},

An acknowledged gap exists between widely referenced technologies that city managers utilize to optimize scheduled operations and those that reflect the capability of spontaneity in search of nuance-laden solutions to problems related to the reflexivity of entire systems. With regulation, the first issue type succumbs to rehearsed preparation whereas the second hinges on extemporaneous practice. One is susceptible to ready-made technology applications while the other requires systemic deconstruction and solution-seeking redesign. Research suggests that smart city vendors are expertly configured to address the former, but less adept at and even ill-configured to react to and address the latter. Departures from status quo responses to systemic problems depend on formalizing metrics that enable city monitoring and data collection to assess "smart investments", regardless of the size of the intervention, and to anticipate the need for designs that preserve the individuality of urban settings as they undergo the transformation to become "smart"..},

We discuss that the Smart City literature must better include analysis around social sustainability issues for city dwellers. Focus here should start on health issues and more critical analysis about whom the Smart City is for. Also, the literature must address issues of resilience and cyber security, including how Smart City solutions may affect the autonomy of urban governance, personal integrity and how it may affect the resilience of infrastructures that provide inhabitants with basic needs, such as food, energy and water security.

abstract = {It is well known that social, cultural and economic factors cause substantial inequalities in health. Should we strive to achieve a more even share of good health, beyond improving the average health status of the population? We examine four arguments for the reduction of health inequalities. 1 Inequalities are unfair. Inequalities in health are undesirable to the extent that they are unfair, or unjust. Distinguishing between health inequalities and health inequities can be contentious. Our view is that inequalities become ″unfair″ when poor health is itself the consequence of an unjust distribution of the underlying social determinants of health (for example, unequal opportunities in education or employment). 2 Inequalities affect everyone. Conditions that lead to marked health disparities are detrimental to all members of society. Some types of health inequalities have obvious spillover effects on the rest of society, for example, the spread of infectious diseases, the consequences of alcohol and drug misuse, or the occurrence of violence and crime. 3 Inequalities are avoidable. Disparities in health are avoidable to the extent that they stem from identifiable policy options exercised by governments, such as tax policy, regulation of business and labour, welfare benefits and health care funding. It follows that health inequalities are, in principle, amenable to policy interventions. A government that cares about improving the health of the population ought therefore to incorporate considerations of the health impact of alternative options in its policy setting process. 3 Interventions to reduce health inequalities are cost effective. Public health programmes that reduce health inequalities can also be cost effective. The case can be made to give priority to such programmes (for example, improving access to cervical cancer screening in low income women) on efficiency grounds. On the other hand, few programmes designed to reduce health inequalities have been formally evaluated using cost effectiveness analysis. We conclude that fairness is likely to be the most influential argument in favour of acting to reduce disparities in health, but the concept of equity is contested and susceptible to different interpretations. There is persuasive evidence for some outcomes that reducing inequalities will diminish ″spill over″ effects on the health of society at large. In principle, you would expect that differences in health status that are not biologically determined are avoidable. However, the mechanisms giving rise to inequalities are still imperfectly understood, and evidence remains to be gathered on the effectiveness of interventions to reduce such inequalities.},

abstract = {This paper develops a conceptual link between smart city planning and urban food systems research in terms of governance and innovation. The 'smart city' concept is linked to an urban research agenda which seeks to embed advances in technology and data collection into the infrastructures of urban environments. Through this neoliberal framework, market-led and technological solutions to city governance and development are prioritised. The urban food movement has a different trajectory compared to the smart city agenda, comprising a diverse mix of urban food production practices, including community and grassroots-based social innovations, and associated more recently with food security discourses. Recognising these ideological and epistemological differences (between the smart city and the urban food movement) is important for conceptualisations of 'smart food city' governance. Based on theoretical reflections, review material and findings from a European project on city-region food systems, the paper argues that smart technology can be an important part of the solution to city food challenges but in combination with social innovations to enable flexible modes of governance that are inclusive, technologically and socially-orientated and linked to specific city-region contexts. Key elements include city regionalism, new organisational structures and connectivities, a circular model of metabolism and social practices.},

abstract = {Background: To our knowledge, no meta-analysis to date has assessed the efficacy of mobile phone apps to promote weight loss and increase physical activity. Objective: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies to compare the efficacy of mobile phone apps compared with other approaches to promote weight loss and increase physical activity. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of relevant studies identified by a search of PubMed, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Scopus from their inception through to August 2015. Two members of the study team (EG-F, GF-M) independently screened studies for inclusion criteria and extracted data. We included all controlled studies that assessed a mobile phone app intervention with weight-related health measures (ie, body weight, body mass index, or waist circumference) or physical activity outcomes. Net change estimates comparing the intervention group with the control group were pooled across studies using random-effects models. Results: We included 12 articles in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Compared with the control group, use of a mobile phone app was associated with significant changes in body weight (kg) and body mass index (kg/m2) of -1.04 kg (95% CI -1.75 to -0.34; I2 = 41%) and -0.43 kg/m2 (95% CI -0.74 to -0.13; I2 = 50%), respectively. Moreover, a nonsignificant difference in physical activity was observed between the two groups (standardized mean difference 0.40, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.87; I2 = 93%). These findings were remarkably robust in the sensitivity analysis. No publication bias was shown. Conclusions: Evidence from this study shows that mobile phone app-based interventions may be useful tools for weight loss.},

abstract = {During the last decade, the challenges of an ageing society became focus for extensive scientific, public and political discussions. From discussions in scientific fora within each discipline, there is now a shift towards cross-disciplinary scientific approaches. The aim of this article is therefore, to collect and describe different scientific viewpoints in this regard and to point out research gaps to be addressed in the future. The article is based on a number of review articles and keynote lectures given by the author, and complemented with informal interviews of experts from different scientific fields engaged in the field of technology and ageing. Results show that research has emerged from being technology-focussed to scenario-based taking different scientific perspectives into account. However, the biggest challenge still is to accommodate the need for a holistic integrated service which means to provide personalised services and adapt technology and content to individual needs of different stakeholders. Further, cross-disciplinary research is needed that relates informatics and technology to different stages of the aging process and that evaluates the effects of proposed technical solutions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Informa UK, Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper provides a brief overview of, and elaborates on, some of the presentations, discussions and conclusions from Day 4 of the 'WHO EURO 2014 International Healthy Cities Conference: Health and the City - Urban Living in the 21st Century', held in Athens, Greece on 25 October 2014. The Internet of Things (IoT) is made of sensors and other components that connect our version of the world made of atoms, i.e., humans/our bodies, our devices, vehicles, roads, buildings, plants, animals, etc., with a mirror digital version made of bits. This enables cities and regions to be self-aware and dynamically reconfigurable in real- or near-real-time, based on changes that are continuously monitored and captured by sensors, similar to the way the internal biological systems of a living being operate and respond to their environment (homeostasis). Data collected by various IoT sensors and processed via appropriate analytics can also help predict the immediate future with reasonable accuracy, which enables better planned responses and mitigation actions. Cities and regions can thus become more adaptable and resilient in face of adversity. Furthermore, IoT can link atoms (humans) to other atoms (humans) (again via bits), resulting in the formation of 'smart(er) communities' that are socially connected in new ways and potentially happier. Cities, but also less urbanised regions and the countryside, could all benefit from, and harness the power of, IoT to improve the health, well-being and overall quality of life of the local populations, actively engage citizens in a smarter governance of their region, empower them to better care for one another, promote stronger social inclusion, and ensure a greener, sustainable and more enjoyable environment for all. Technology can also help reverse the 'brain drain' from the countryside and smaller towns to larger metropolises by making the former more attractive and connected, with better services akin to those found in larger cities. The article also discusses some ways of measuring and benchmarking the performance of smart cities and their impact on well-being. However, it should be emphasised that technology is not a panacea and that other factors are equally important in creating happier and healthier cities and regions.},

abstract = {It has long been recognised that urban form impacts on health outcomes and their determinants. There is growing interest in creating indicators of liveability to measure progress towards achieving a wide range of policy outcomes, including enhanced health and wellbeing, and reduced inequalities. This review aimed to: 1) bring together the concepts of urban 'liveability' and social determinants of health; 2) synthesise the various liveability indicators developed to date; and 3) assess their quality using a health and wellbeing lens. Between 2011 and 2013, the research team reviewed 114 international academic and policy documents, as well as reports related to urban liveability. Overall, 233 indicators were found. Of these, 61 indicators were regarded as promising, 57 indicators needed further development, and 115 indicators were not useful for our purposes. Eleven domains of liveability were identified that likely contribute to health and wellbeing through the social determinants of health. These were: crime and safety; education; employment and income; health and social services; housing; leisure and culture; local food and other goods; natural environment; public open space; transport; and social cohesion and local democracy. Many of the indicators came from Australian sources; however most remain relevant from a 'global north' perspective. Although many indicators were identified, there was inconsistency in how these domains were measured. Few have been validated to assess their association with health and wellbeing outcomes, and little information was provided for how they should be applied to guide urban policy and practice. There is a substantial opportunity to further develop these measures to create a series of robust and evidence-based liveability indices, which could be linked with existing health and wellbeing data to better inform urban planning policies within Australia and beyond. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

But in practice the agenda is an uncertain one, usually only partially developed, and often more about corporate-led urban development than about urban social justice. Rather than leave smart urbanism to the corporate and political elites, there are opportunities now for critical urban scholarship to not only critique how it is currently constituted, but to give shape to a globally oriented alternative smart urban agenda. An ambition like this means taking the ‘urban' in ‘smart urban' much more seriously. It means foregrounding the knowledges, political priorities and needs of those either actively excluded or included in damaging ways in mainstream smart urban discourses. We outline steps towards an alternative smart urbanism. We seek to move beyond the specific to the general and do so by drawing on radically different initiatives across the Global North and South. These initiatives provide tantalizing openings to a more socially just use of digital technology, where urban priorities and justice drive the use—or lack of use—of technology.},

@article{Capdevila2015c,
abstract = {Purpose – In recent years, the term “smart city” has attracted a lot of attention from policy makers, business leaders and citizenship in general. Although there is not a unique definition of what a smart city is, it is generally accepted that “smart” urban policies refer to local governments' initiatives that use information and communication technologies in order to increase the quality of life of their inhabitants while contributing to a sustainable development. So far, “smart city” approaches have generally been related to top-down processes of technology diffusion. The purpose of this paper is to present a broader view on “smart” initiatives to analyze both top-down and bottom-up dynamics in a smart city. The authors argue that these two perspectives are complementary and its combination can reinforce the collaboration between different city stakeholders. Top-down and bottom-up initiatives are not opposed forces but, on the contrary, can have a synergistic effect on the innovation capacity of the city. Both perspectives are illustrated by providing examples of different “smart” aspects in the city of Barcelona: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. Design/methodology/approach – To illustrate the arguments, the authors analyze the case of the city of Barcelona providing examples of top-down and bottom-up initiatives in four different smart city aspects: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. The research method is based on a case study (Yin, 1984). The primary data consisted on interviews to city council representatives as well as managers of local public institutions, like economic development offices, and local organizations like for instance coworking spaces. The authors interviewed also specialists on the innovation history of the city in order to validate the data. In addition, the authors used secondary data such as reports on the 22@, and documentation on the Barcelona innovation policies, as well as doing a compilation of press articles and the online content of the institutional webpages. All together, the authors have followed a data triangulation strategy to seek data validation based on the cross-verification of the analyzed data sources. Findings – The analysis suggests that the top-down and bottom-up perspectives are complementary and their combination can reinforce the collaboration between different city stakeholders. Top-down and bottom-up initiatives are not opposed forces but, on the contrary, can have a synergistic effect on the innovation capacity of the city. Both perspectives are illustrated by providing examples of different “smart” aspects in the city of Barcelona: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. Research limitations/implications – Nevertheless, the analysis has its limitations. Even if the authors have emphasized the importance of the bottom-up initiatives, citizens do not have often the resources to act without governmental intervention. This is the case of services that require high-cost infrastructures or regulatory changes. Also, as it usually happens in the case of disruptive technology, it is hard for citizens to understand the possibilities of its use. In these cases, firms and institutions must play an important role in the first phases of the diffusion of innovations, by informing and incentivizing its use. It is also important to note that some of the emerging usages of technology are confronted to legal or regulatory issues. For instance, distributed and shared Wi-Fi networks might be in opposition to economic interests of internet providers, that often difficult its expansion. It is also the case of services of the sharing economy that represent a menace to established institutions (like the tensions between Uber and taxi companies, or Airbnb and hotels). In these cases, city halls like it is the case in Barcelona, tend to respond to these emergent uses of technology by regulating to ensure protection to existing corporate services. Practical implications – In conclusion, the transformational process that leads a city to become a smart city has to take in consideration the complexity and the plurality of the urban reality. Beyond considering citizens as being users, testers or consumers of technology, local administrations that are able to identify, nourish and integrate the emerging citizens' initiatives would contribute to the reinforcement of a smart city reality. Originality/value – The contribution of the paper is to go beyond the generalized technologic discourse around smart cities by adding the layer of the citizens' initiatives.},

This paper focuses on the former and, drawing on a number of examples, details how cities are being instrumented with digital devices and infrastructure that produce 'big data'.

abstract = {Smart cities are increasingly advocated by governments and the private sector as the primary means to deliver urban sustainability. Particularly in Europe and North America, the smart city is envisioned as a place where digital technologies are deployed to ‘solve' urban sustainability problems. Such visions have been broadly critiqued in the urban studies literature for reflecting techno-utopian, neoliberal approaches to urban development that exert corporate control over cities, but there has been little empirical verification of these critiques. More recently, a disparate and interdisciplinary body of literature has emerged documenting the impacts of smart city initiatives in practice. This paper provides a state-of-the-art, empirically informed analysis of smart-sustainability, which considers established critiques of smart city policy and visions alongside the increasing body of evidence concerning the actual experiences of smart city initiatives. Through a systematic review of the smart city literature pertaining to Europe and North America, we identify and test five tensions between the smart city and the goals of sustainable urban development. These tensions involve: (1) reinforcing neoliberal economic growth; (2) focusing on more affluent populations; (3) disempowering and marginalising citizens; (4) neglecting environmental protection; and, (5) failing to challenge prevailing consumerist cultures. On the basis of these findings we propose how digital technologists, urban developers, municipalities and citizens might address these tensions. A key finding is that the potential to empower and include citizens represents the key to unlocking forms of smart-sustainable urban development that emphasise environmental protection and social equity, rather than merely reinforcing neoliberal forms of urban development.},

Using this periodisation, the paper shows how the content of urban sustainability discourse has changed. First, it illustrates that the dominant assumption of sustainable cities' discourse was to utilise economic growth to ecologically modernise urban environments. Second, it examines how the global economic crisis has intensified this fix and led to a new, even narrower emphasis on the techno-economic value of those aspects of urban environment that have economic and market potential. Third, it analyses the fragmenting of sustainable cities' discourse into a set of competing logics that reflect this narrower agenda. This paper argues that the sustainable city has been absorbed into these new logics that are much more narrowly techno-economically focused and are squeezing out traditional concerns with social justice and equity.},

abstract = {Smart city approaches in city planning have gained significant momentum in the recent past. While proponents argue that smart cities will bring positive social change by the adoption of ICTs, enriched governance and human capital among the citizenry, opponents point out about the negative effects and gaps exist in their planning and execution. Despite efforts to promote its practice, there has been wide criticism about the concept and the way it has been adopted and implemented. The roles of various players, especially the central role of the private sector, is often challenged in the academic literature. A variety of expectations from various stakeholders make the potential implementation strategies even more complex. The current paper reviews the research in the field to date to find that there are conflicting views in smart city planning, which limit our knowledge about the ‘real' smart city and its implications for building creative and inclusive urban space. Such uncertainty at the conceptual level, and the heightened importance given by policy makers and markets to its adoption, highlights the need for proper scrutiny. The paper clusters the various views pertaining to the building of smart cities and, thereby, proposes a 3RC framework, consisting of Restrictive, Reflective, Rationalistic and Critical schools, which critically analyses various stages in the development of the field. The overall aim of the paper is to understand how smart cities differ in their meanings, intentions and ‘offerings'.},

abstract = {While scholars critique the first-generation of the corporate smart city for failing to tackle people-oriented agendas and authentically respond to the needs of residents, many point to a potential to move beyond narrow environmental and economic objectives and tackle social issues. But concrete empirical evidence of this potential is visibly lacking. In parallel, researchers have brought attention to the emergence of the so-called ‘smart city 2.0'. This is framed as a decentralised, people-centric approach where smart technologies are employed as tools to tackle social problems, address resident needs and foster collaborative participation. This contrasts to the techno-economic and centralised approach of the dominating ‘smart city 1.0' or first-generation paradigm, which is primarily focused on diffusing smart technologies for corporate and economic interests. Utilising this dichotomy as an analytical framework, this paper examines Aizuwakamatsu Smart City in Fukushima, Japan to demonstrate how a smart city can be framed and implemented as a tool for tackling endogenous social challenges. Findings unearth a myriad of novel approaches to utilising data and ICT to respond to resident needs, improve livelihoods and widely share smart city benefits. Yet they also point to a need to transcend polarised discourses around alternative models of smart cities and appreciate the messy reality of hybrid, on-the-ground smart urbanisation and the co-existence of contrasting yet complementary visions and approaches.},

abstract = {Contemporary smart cities have largely mirrored the sustainable development agenda by embracing an ecological modernisation approach to urban development. There is a strong focus on stimulating economic activity and environmental protection with little emphasis on social equity and the human experience. The health and well-being agenda has potential to shift the focus of smart cities to centre on social aims. Through the systematic and widespread application of technologies such as wearable health monitors, the creation of open data platforms for health parameters, and the development of virtual communication between patients and health professionals, the smart city can serve as a means to improve the lives of urban residents. In this article, we present a case study of smart health in Kashiwanoha Smart City in Japan. We explore how the pursuit of greater health and well-being has stretched smart city activities beyond technological innovation to directly impact resident lifestyles and become more socially relevant. Smart health strategies examined include a combination of experiments in monitoring and visualisation, education through information provision, and enticement for behavioural change. Findings suggest that smart cities have great potential to be designed and executed to tackle social problems and realise more sustainable, equitable and liveable cities.},

abstract = {The rise and rise of sustainability in urban and social policy circles has transformed the discursive terrain of urban politics. In 2009, Gunder and Hillier argued sustainability is now urban planning's central empty signifier, offering an overarching narrative around which practice can be oriented. This paper takes up the notion of sustainability as an empty/master-signifier, arguing that the recognition of its nominal status is central to understanding how it operates to produce ideological foundation. Drawing upon a series of interviews and focus groups with urban and social policy makers and practitioners in Vancouver, Canada, Zizek's 1989 critique of the cynical functioning of contemporary ideology is used to interpret the city's engagement with sustainability. Focusing on 'social sustainability' it is argued that sustainability has provided a quilting point that has enabled new social and urban policy-related partnerships and organizational agendas to be developed. However, this coherence remains unstable and plagued by questions of signification due to the radical negativity of the master-signifier, where efforts at definition and agreement are haunted by the non-presence of sustainability. It is argued that this framing of sustainability as ideological conduit in Vancouver helps explain the co-presence of transformative rhetoric and business-as-usual. Using Zizek's critique of cynical reason in contemporary ideology, interview data is drawn upon to show how many practitioners seek to distance themselves from sustainability, but at the same time continue to act it out anyway. In conclusion, the sobering politics of Zizek's critique of contemporary ideology are considered in the light of growing urban problems. {\textcopyright} 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract = {Significant global health challenges are being confronted in the 21st century, prompting calls to rethink approaches to disease prevention. A key part of the solution is city planning that reduces non-communicable diseases and road trauma while also managing rapid urbanisation. This Series of papers considers the health impacts of city planning through transport mode choices. In this, the first paper, we identify eight integrated regional and local interventions that, when combined, encourage walking, cycling, and public transport use, while reducing private motor vehicle use. These interventions are destination accessibility, equitable distribution of employment across cities, managing demand by reducing the availability and increasing the cost of parking, designing pedestrian-friendly and cycling-friendly movement networks, achieving optimum levels of residential density, reducing distance to public transport, and enhancing the desirability of active travel modes (eg, creating safe attractive neighbourhoods and safe, affordable, and convenient public transport). Together, these interventions will create healthier and more sustainable compact cities that reduce the environmental, social, and behavioural risk factors that affect lifestyle choices, levels of traffic, environmental pollution, noise, and crime. The health sector, including health ministers, must lead in advocating for integrated multisector city planning that prioritises health, sustainability, and liveability outcomes, particularly in rapidly changing low-income and middle-income countries. We recommend establishing a set of indicators to benchmark and monitor progress towards achievement of more compact cities that promote health and reduce health inequities.},

The term “smart city” has been used synonymously with other terms, such as “digital city”, “sustainable city”, and “information city”, even though definitional distinctions exist between terms. In this review, we use “smart cities” as a catch-all term to refer to an emerging concept in urban governance practice and scholarship that has been increasingly applied to achieve public health aims. The objective of this systematic review was to document and analyze the inclusion of equity considerations and dimensions (i.e., a measurement, analytical, or dialectical focus on systematic disparities in health between groups) in smart city interventions aimed to improve human health and well-being. Systematic searches were carried out in the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Psychological Information Database (PsycINFO), the PubMed database from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, Elsevier's database Scopus, and Web of Science, returning 3219 titles. Ultimately, 28 articles were retained, assessed, and coded for their inclusion of equity characteristics using the Cochrane PROGRESS-Plus tool (referring to (P) place of residence, (R) race, (O) occupation, (G) gender, (R) religion, (E) education, (S) socio-economic status (SES), and (S) social capital). The most frequently included equity considerations in smart city health interventions were place of residence, SES, social capital, and personal characteristics; conversely, occupation, gender or sex, religion, race, ethnicity, culture, language, and education characteristics were comparatively less featured in such interventions. Overall, it appears that most of intervention evaluations assessed in this review are still in the early testing phases, and thus did not include or feature robust evaluative designs or commercially available technologies},

Does the adoption of information technology lead to massive regional unemployment? It is a crucial and unresolved issue for the government, enterprise employees, and researchers. Combining the 2005–2020 panel and the smart city (SC) construction policy in China, this article employs the difference in differences (DID) method to study the impact of informatization construction on labour spatial allocation. We found that informatization construction significantly attracted labour and improved labour spatial allocation. After the SC construction policy's implementation, compared with non-SCs, the average increase of SC pilots in the labour force is about 0.78 million people. Besides, stimulating economic growth, improving the environment, and enhancing public services are the mechanisms of the SC construction policy on labour spatial allocation. Furthermore, this policy effect has heterogeneous industry department and category characteristics. The Tertiary and secondary industry department receives a more significant impact.},

The Chinese government has been devoting to the promotion of smart cities for many years. However, it is unconfirmed whether the city is more resilient with all the modern technologies provided when unexpected predicaments like climate changes or disasters occur. Therefore, it is urgent to consider resilience in the smart city. This paper provides a MCDM approach to assess and rank the resilience of 187 smart cities in China. The results demonstrate that the overall resilience of smart cities is at a relatively low level. There is also a significant unbalance of resilience between smart cities due to different infrastructural, economic, social, institutional, and environmental conditions. The potential links between urban smartness and resilience were also explored, and the results showed significant positive relationship between the smartness of a city and its resilience. Evidence also proved that developing smartness is more or less useful for improving urban resilience. Suggestions such as strengthening the development of infrastructure and economy, and enhancing the multi-stakeholders' cooperation are proposed to further promote the smart and resilient development in China.},

Using CiteSpace, co-occurrence analysis of categories is conducted to explore the evolution of the disciplines engaged in SC research; co-word analysis of the keywords and document co-citation analysis associated with cluster analysis are further performed to reveal the development paths and research topics in terms of burst terms, text and citation-based clusters, citation structure, and pivotal points in the field. These scientometric techniques are combined to: (1) reveal the intellectual division of this developing field using a visual and comprehensive approach, (2) identify in chronological order the 10 core research sub-topics in this area with burst references and terms, (3) identify Internet of Things, big data, and fog computing as the most promising technologies for SC planning and development, and (4) conclude that smart sustainable cities and sustainable smart cities are the two emerging trends in the domain.

It is seen as a possible remedy for the challenges that urbanisation creates in the age of global climate change, and as an enabler of a sustainable and liveable urban future. A review of the abundant but fragmented literature on smart city theories and practices, nevertheless, reveals that there is a limited effort to capture a comprehensive understanding on how the complex and multidimensional nature of the drivers of smart cities are linked to desired outcomes. The paper aims to develop a clearer understanding on this new city model by identifying and linking the key drivers to desired outcomes, and then intertwining them in a multidimensional framework. The methodological approach of this research includes a systematic review of the literature on smart cities, focusing on those aimed at conceptual development and provide empirical evidence base. The review identifies that the literature reveals three types of drivers of smart cities—community, technology, policy—which are linked to five desired outcomes—productivity, sustainability, accessibility, wellbeing, liveability, governance. These drivers and outcomes altogether assemble a smart city framework, where each of them represents a distinctive dimension of the smart cities notion. This paper helps in expanding our understanding beyond a monocentric technology focus of the current common smart city practice.},

So comes the natural question: has smart city construction improved the eco-efficiency of cities In China? How does the impact change over time? Is the impact heterogeneous across cities? Based on Green Solow model, this paper adopts the Super-efficiency SBM model to measure the eco-efficiency of 152 prefecture-level cities in China covering the period 2003-2016, and then DID model is applied to investigate the impact of smart city pilot policy on eco-efficiency. On the whole, the smart city construction significantly improves the eco-efficiency, and the multi-stage DID results reveal that the promotion effect is increasing over time due to the annual superposition. Furthermore, the impact is heterogeneous across cities. Although the promotion effect on medium-sized cities is less than that of large cities, the promotion effect has actually weakened when the urban population size exceeds 5 million. Moreover, the lower the level of city's economic development, the greater the role of smart city construction in promoting eco-efficiency.

Our findings suggest that the digital divide for low-income children in Shanghai is getting smaller or even closing, but the urban–rural divide might be a factor in aggravating digital exclusion. Preliminary group comparisons show that low-income-no-Internet children reported significantly lower scores on all dimensions of digital literacy, academic performance, aspirations, perceived efficacy, self-esteem, family and peer relationships. On the contrary, low-income children with Internet access did not show significant differences with nonlow-income group across all dimensions. While we cannot conclude that there is a direct relationship between Internet access and improved developmental outcomes, the strength of the association suggests that there may be value in efforts being focused on assisting families in the lowest income strata, and on agricultural household registration, to acquire home Internet access.},

The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of ICT on socio-economic development in China by considering spatial effects. To understand the overall influence of ICT on socio-economic development, the study used principal component analysis (PCA) to establish composite ICT and socio-economic development indexes based on data collected from 31 provinces in the period 2009–2018. In applying the spatial panel data analysis, this article argues that a spatial Durbin model (SDM) with spatial fixed effects is the most suitable model for the purpose of making estimations. The results of the SDM suggest the socio-economic development of provinces contains strong spatial correlations. More specifically, although ICT plays an essential role in improving socio-economic development, the spatial spillover effects of ICT negatively affect the socio-economic development in adjacent areas, implying that a digital divide exists among China's provinces and that this digital gap can lead to unbalanced socio-economic development. The article concludes by outlining some practical policy recommendations for the advancement of ICT going forward to help alleviate the adverse effects of the digital divide and enhance the benefits of ICT-based socio-economic development.},

First, this paper adopts the true fixed effect stochastic frontier approach (TFE-SFA) model to measure the input–output efficiency of the ICT equipment manufacturing industry and the ICT service industry. Results show that the input–output efficiency of the ICT equipment manufacturing industry is generally higher than that of the ICT service industry, and the efficiency of both industries has remarkable potential to improve. We also explore the regional differences in the input–output efficiency of the digital economy industry. It shows that the differences in the input–output efficiency for China's digital economy industry tend to expand in both the ICT equipment manufacturing industry and the ICT service industry. The differences in the ICT service industry are larger, and the efficiency difference in the digital economy industry comes from inter-regional differences. Finally, this paper analyzes the spatial–temporal dynamic evolution of the digital economy industry by using the methods of kernel density estimation, Moran spatial correlation analysis, and Markov chain state analysis. The state of the input–output efficiency of different provinces' digital economy industries is relatively stable, and no obvious spatial correlation exists.},

abstract = {Global warming is one of the issues of great concern in the world. The large-scale use of fossil fuels has led to the continuous increase in carbon emissions, resulting in global energy shortages and environmental pollution. Reasonable and strict environmental regulation promotes technological innovation by enterprises to achieve a win-win situation between the economy and environment, which is the core idea of the Porter hypothesis. The choice of China, as the world's largest energy consumer and carbon emitter, is not only related to the country's own mode of economic growth but also determines the development of the world's low-carbon economy. We used the panel data from 2000 to 2016 of 30 provincial-level administrative regions in China and adopted the Propensity Score Matching–Difference in Differences method to test the impact of China's carbon trading pilot system on the transformation of a low-carbon economy. The empirical results show that under the constraints of the established resources and environment, there is a positive relationship to some extent between China's carbon trading system and low-carbon economic transformation. This relationship can realize the win-win situation of environmental and economic benefits as advocated by the Porter hypothesis and further verify the applicability of the Porter hypothesis.},

abstract = {The environment for most organizations today is global, complex, dynamic, highly competitive, and extremely volatile, and is likely to remain so for years to come. In addition to these external conditions, most organizations are also facing several global challenges including those related to: talent flow; the managing of two generations of employees, viz., older or mature workers and younger workers; and a shortage of needed competencies. One major result of these challenges for organizations is that they have to be global and that they have to be systematic in managing their human capital if they wish to have any hope of gaining and sustaining a competitive advantage in the years ahead. Many human resource practitioners and consultants (HR professionals) are now recognizing this, especially those that operate globally, the multinational enterprises. Academics are also showing a strong interest as evidenced by their work in the new area referred to as "global talent management". In this article we review that academic work and attempt to organize that literature by creating an integrative framework for understanding and advancing further research in global talent management. To guide this research our framework highlights several selected challenges in global talent management, and several drivers of those challenges. It also highlights the potential role of IHRM activities in addressing those selected challenges. A discussion of possible criteria of global talent management effectiveness completes the framework. Hopefully this integrative framework may guide further academic research on global talent management and might also inform the work of HR professionals. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {“Carbon Peaking and Carbon Neutrality” is one of the important tasks of China's current and future economic construction and development, but the carbon emission reduction effect of High-speed rail (HSR) has not yet been fully studied. In this paper, based on the panel data of 274 cities in China from 2003 to 2016, we take the opening of HSR in the cities as a “Quasi-natural Experiment”, and construct the Multi-period Difference-in-Difference Model to explore whether the opening of HSR can reduce carbon emissions of cities along the route, and use the mediating effect model and moderating effect model to further analyze its internal mechanisms. We find that:①The opening of HSR can significantly reduce the carbon emissions of cities along the route, and the opening of HSR in a city will reduce the carbon emissions of the city by about 2.4% on average, and this carbon emission reduction effect usually manifests significantly in the first year after the opening of HSR, and increases year by year thereafter.②The mechanism test shows that the traffic substitution effect, the optimization of the industrial structure and the promotion of economic agglomeration have partial mediating effect on the influence between the opening of HSR and urban carbon emissions. In addition, the increase in the intensity of government environmental regulations can strengthen the effect of the opening of HSR on reducing urban carbon emissions.③The regional heterogeneity research shows that the opening of HSR has a more significant impact on the carbon emissions of cities in the eastern coastal region and western region of China. Moreover, in the western region, the reduction effect of the opening of HSR on carbon emissions is only reflected in the key cities rather than ordinary prefecture-level cities. This paper provides certain reference significance for promoting low-carbon and green economy and helping China to achieve the “Carbon Neutrality” climate action goal.},

As a new urban development model, smart city construction may become the key to solving this problem. Based on a literature review on smart city construction and carbon emissions, this study uses a multi-period difference-in-difference model for empirical analysis, aiming to assess the impact of smart city pilot policy on carbon productivity. We find that: (1) Smart city construction has increased urban carbon productivity by 2.045%. Among them, the promotion effect of eastern and central cities is noticeable, while western cities have a restraining effect. (2) The impact of smart city construction on carbon productivity has a time-lag effect. The pilot policy will take effect in the third year of implementation and reach its maximum value in the fifth year. (3) Smart city construction can improve urban carbon productivity through technological progress, industrial structure upgrading, and energy structure optimization. Therefore, it is recommended to formulate policies from collaborative innovation between cities, optimizing industrial structure, and accelerating renewable energy replacement to achieve sustainable economic development.},

The Chinese government has been devoting good efforts to the promotion of smart city through introducing a series of policies. However, policies may have limited effectiveness in application if they do not respond to the practice. There is little study examining what results have been achieved in practice by applying policy measures. This study presents a holistic evaluation of smart city performance in the context of China. The evaluation indicators in this study are selected by applying a hybrid research methodology including literature review and semi-structured interviews. Indicator data are collected from 44 sample smart cities. The evaluation was conducted by applying Entropy method and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) technique collectively. This study highlights that the overall smart city performance in China is at a relatively low level. There is also a significant unbalance in performance between five smart city dimensions including smart infrastructure, governance, people, economy and environment. The smart performance between cities varies significantly since cities implement smart city programs in different ways. These differences impede experience sharing between cities. Actions have been recommended in this study for promoting further development of smart city in the context of China, such as increasing the investment on smart infrastructure, providing training programs, and establishing evaluation mechanism.},

On the one hand, improvements in infrastructure are expected to expand economic opportunities for previously underserved populations. On the other hand, ICT growth may exacerbate inequality due to differential access and skill premiums. We use panel data from 109 countries during the period 2001–2014 to examine the empirical connection between ICT and income inequality in a cross-national context. Our results suggest that the effect of ICT on income inequality depends both on the specific type of ICT and on the measure of income inequality. In addition, the magnitude of ICT's effect on income inequality is comparable to that of more traditional forms of economic infrastructure. Finally, we find that the association between ICT and income inequality is conditional on other economic and political characteristics.},

This paper mainly studies how internet development affects China's energy consumption and the associated transmission mechanism. Specifically, this paper constructs an evaluation system of China's internet development level from four perspectives: internet popularity, internet infrastructure, internet information resources and internet application. On this basis, the relationship between internet development and China's energy consumption is investigated and found to be significantly positive; moreover, internet development promotes the energy consumption scale through economic growth. The relationship between internet development and the energy consumption structure is significantly negative, and internet development affects the energy consumption structure through economic growth, R&D investment, human capital, financial development, and the industrial structure. Interestingly, there is also empirical evidence that the nexus of internet development and energy consumption intensity is significantly negative, and internet development helps to accelerate the decline in energy consumption intensity through economic growth, R&D investment, human capital, financial development, and industrial structural upgrading.},

This technology-intensive use frequently comes with large investments in the ICT infrastructure necessary for smart city initiatives, which may not be financially viable in the long term. Financial sustainability (FS) is a useful framework for assessing how governments meet their financial obligations, using different indicators of financial performance over time by controlling for contextual factors. This study examines 1723 municipal governments; only 89 of these explicitly conducted smart-city initiatives in Mexico over three time points (2014, 2016, and 2018). Panel data techniques were applied to compare the effects of the investments in ICT infrastructure across municipalities with or without smart-city initiatives on five indicators related to the financial condition within the FS framework (i.e., cash solvency, budget solvency, long-term solvency, service-level solvency for revenues and expenses). The results show an association between ICT infrastructure and some dimensions of FS. The main findings suggest the importance of adequate financial analysis for long-term capital and budgeting decisions, to create a more solid smart city financial strategy for the long term. Specific recommendations for city managers are also discussed.},

The causal parameter of interest is partially identified under these restrictions. We introduce two approaches that guarantee uniformly valid inference under the imposed restrictions, and we derive novel results showing that they have desirable power properties in our context. We illustrate how economic knowledge can inform the restrictions on the possible violations of parallel trends in two economic applications. We also highlight how our approach can be used to conduct sensitivity analyses showing what causal conclusions can be drawn under various restrictions on the possible violations of the parallel trends assumption.},

However, to properly work with high-dimensional data sets, PCA poses severe mathematical constraints on the minimum number of different replicates, or samples, that must be included in the analysis. Generally, improper sampling is due to a small number of data respect to the number of the degrees of freedom that characterize the ensemble. In the field of life sciences it is often important to have an algorithm that can accept poorly dimensioned data sets, including degenerated ones. Here a new random projection algorithm is proposed, in which a random symmetric matrix surrogates the covariance/correlation matrix of PCA, while maintaining the data clustering capacity. We demonstrate that what is important for clustering efficiency of PCA is not the exact form of the covariance/correlation matrix, but simply its symmetry.},

This paper provides with a comprehensive understanding of the notion of SC through the elaboration of a taxonomy of pertinent application domains, namely: natural resources and energy, transport and mobility, buildings, living, government, and economy and people. It also explores the diffusion of smart initiatives via an empirical study aimed at investigating the ratio of domains covered by a city's best practices to the total of potential domains of smart initiatives and at understanding the role that various economic, urban, demographic, and geographical variables might have in influencing the planning approach to create a smarter city. Results reveal that the evolution patterns of a SC highly depend on its local context factors. In particular, economic development and structural urban variables are likely to influence a city's digital path, the geographical location to affect the SC strategy, and density of population, with its associated congestion problems, might an important component to determine the routes for the SC implementation.

It uniquely identifies the factors affecting the digital divide that have emerged in recent years (2017–2021) as well as investigate if there are new forms or levels of the divide that have surfaced in recent literature. The findings, based on 50 included studies, show that the factors affecting the digital divide can be classified into three different segments and nine main categories: sociodemographic, socioeconomic, personal elements, social support, type of technology, digital training, rights, infrastructure, and large-scale events. Out of all factors, education has been linked to the digital divide the most. The majority of recent literature have studied Level 2 of the divide. Also, only one article in the sample has considered the digital divide at the firm level. Findings also show that a new form, type-of-internet access, and two potential new levels of the digital divide, algorithmic awareness and data inequalities, have been identified in the contemporary literature. The results contribute to the understanding and development of the different perspectives of the digital divide concept. They also contribute to the stream of literature on the determinants of the divide and to the social inequalities and digital inclusion literature.

In doing so, we build on debates around smart citizens, smart public participation, and grassroots and bottom-up smart cities that are concerned with making smart cities more inclusive. The growing critical scholarship on such discourses, however, alerts us to the knowledge politics that are involved in, and the urban inequalities that are deeply rooted within, the urban. Technological interventions contribute to these politics and inequalities in various ways. Accordingly, we discuss limitations of the current discourses around inclusive smart cities and suggest a need for a nuanced definition of ‘inclusiveness'. We also discuss the necessity to further engage with critical data studies in order to ‘know' what we are critiquing.},

abstract = {This paper describes the information technology (IT) foundation and principles for Smarter Cities. Smarter Cities are urban areas that exploit operational data, such as that arising from traffic congestion, power consumption statistics, and public safety events, to optimize the operation of city services. The foundational concepts are instrumented, interconnected, and intelligent. Instrumented refers to sources of near-real-time real-world data from both physical and virtual sensors. Interconnected means the integration of those data into an enterprise computing platform and the communication of such information among the various city services. Intelligent refers to the inclusion of complex analytics, modeling, optimization, and visualization in the operational business processes to make better operational decisions. This approach enables the adaptation of city services to the behavior of the inhabitants, which permits the optimal use of the available physical infrastructure and resources, for example, in sensing and controlling consumption of energy and water, managing waste processing and transportation systems, and applying optimization to achieve new efficiencies among these resources. Additional roles exist in intelligent interaction between the city and its inhabitants and further contribute to operational efficiency while maintaining or enhancing quality of life. {\textcopyright} 2010 IBM.},

Using panel data from China's 30 provincial administrative regions from 2006 to 2017, this study explores the direct impact, moderating effect, nonlinear relationship, and regional differences of ICT development on GTFEE. It is indicated that ICT development plays a positive role in promoting GTFEE and that this role is moderated by environmental regulations. The regression results of the dynamic threshold model indicate that diverse environmental regulation intensities lead to different influences of ICT development on GTFEE. Moreover, the impact of ICT development on GTFEE is heterogeneous among different regions. Specifically, the western region may gain more benefits from ICT development by virtue of the late-mover advantage.},

Exploring the influence of smart city pilot policies on urban innovation performance is critical for achieving high-quality economic development and creating an innovation-driven country. This study views the experimental smart city policy in China as a quasi-natural experiment and assesses the improved influence of smart city development on urban innovation performance by constructing a multiple period difference-in-differences (DID) model, then confirms it using a variety of robustness test methodologies. The results show that urban innovation performance benefits from the construction of smart cities, and the promotion effect is sustainable. The level of economic development and information infrastructure, as well as the financial innovation expenditure, have a beneficial effect in encouraging smart city construction innovation performance, while the degree of opening-up hinders the improvement of smart city urban innovation performance. In addition, it is also found that there is heterogeneity in the promotion effect of smart city building on urban innovation performance.

We demonstrate that while processes of smart city making have strongly been inclined toward technocratic approaches and deterministic appeals, this inclination is highly deceptive. We argue that rather than being deterministic, these processes are essentially politicized, highly contested, and shaped by the role and impact of local practices and context-specific realities. In making this argument, we draw from a social studies of technology perspective which engages with the notion of technological determinism to make this contribution to the academic field of critical urbanism.},

Integrating urban and digital planning, smart cities are being marketed across the world as solutions to the challenges of urbanization and sustainable development. In India, in particular, there has been a move towards building 100 new smart cities in the future in order to spur economic growth and urbanization. Using the case of Dholera, the first Indian smart city, I examine how global models of smart cities are provincialized in the regional state of Gujarat through local histories, politics and laws. First, I argue that Dholera smart city is part of a longer genealogy of utopian urban planning that emerged as a response to the challenges of development and modernity in post-independent India. Second, that Dholera highlights a shift towards an ‘entrepreneurial urbanization' in a regional state interested in scaling up a ‘Gujarat model of development' for emulation at the scale of the nation. Finally, that in Dholera ‘speed' is a relative term across its scales of manifestation from the global to local, where short ‘bursts of speed' in conceptualization and investment is matched by significant ‘bottlenecks' via local protests. The article concludes that Dholera's fault lines are built into its utopian imaginings, which prioritizes urbanization as a business model rather than a model of social justice.},

At the microlevel, convergence analysis indicates that a catch-up process has taken place in both income groups, with the low-income group displaying a faster catch-up speed in all three technologies. Combining the findings from the macro and the microlevel of the analysis revealed a positive relationship between the increasing rates of the absolute digital divide and the annual rate of catch-up by the low-income group. The faster is the increasing rate of the absolute digital divide, the faster the speed of catch-up by the low-income group of countries becomes.

Alleged eco-cities are being built across a variety of spaces via processes of urbanisation triggering substantial environmental, social and economic impacts. This article investigates how new eco-city projects interpret and practice urban sustainability by focusing on the policy context that underpins their development. The article argues that projects for new eco-cities are shaped in loci by policy agendas tailored around specific economic and political targets. In these terms, the ideas and strategies of urban sustainability adopted by eco-city developers are understood as reflections of broader policy priorities. The case study employed in this article, Masdar City, reveals how the Emirati eco-city initiative is the product of local agendas seeking economic growth via urbanisation to preserve the political institutions of Abu Dhabi. Following the economic imperatives set by the ruling class, the Masdar City project interprets sustainability as ecological modernisation and practices urban environmentalism almost exclusively in economic terms. The article shows how the developers of Masdar City capitalise on sustainability by building an urban platform to develop and commercialise clean-tech products, and concludes that the Emirati alleged eco-city is an example of urban eco-modernisation: a high-tech urban development informed by market analysis rather than ecological studies.},

Difference in differences (DID) estimations are conducted and highlight the particular contribution of SEACOM and EASSy cables, laid in 2009–2010, to Internet penetration in Eastern and Southern Africa. According to DID estimates, the rollout of these SMCs has yielded a 3–5 percentage point increase in Internet penetration rates in this region compared to the rest of SSA.

The majority of studies indicates that the productivity effect of ICT is indeed positive and significant. However, methodological approaches of how to appropriately estimate the ICT effect matter. While aggregate and sectoral growth accounting exercises suggest stronger differences of the ICT effect between US and Europe, firm-level analyses suggest no significant country differences. Moreover, we shed light on the notion of ICT being a General Propose Technology (GPT) enabling further innovations. Most of the GPT evidence on ICT is found for the US, while evidence for European countries is harder to come by.

We first sketch our vision defining seven goals which concern: developing a new understanding of urban problems; effective and feasible ways to coordinate urban technologies; models and methods for using urban data across spatial and temporal scales; developing new technologies for communication and dissemination; developing new forms of urban governance and organisation; defining critical problems relating to cities, transport, and energy; and identifying risk, uncertainty, and hazards in the smart city. To this, we add six research challenges: to relate the infrastructure of smart cities to their operational functioning and planning through management, control and optimisation; to explore the notion of the city as a laboratory for innovation; to provide portfolios of urban simulation which inform future designs; to develop technologies that ensure equity, fairness and realise a better quality of city life; to develop technologies that ensure informed participation and create shared knowledge for democratic city governance; and to ensure greater and more effective mobility and access to opportunities for urban populations.We begin by defining the state of the art, explaining the science of smart cities. We define six scenarios based on new cities badging themselves as smart, older cities regenerating themselves as smart, the development of science parks, tech cities, and technopoles focused on high technologies, the development of urban services using contemporary ICT, the use of ICT to develop new urban intelligence functions, and the development of online and mobile forms of participation. Seven project areas are then proposed: Integrated Databases for the Smart City, Sensing, Networking and the Impact of New Social Media, Modelling Network Performance, Mobility and Travel Behaviour, Modelling Urban Land Use, Transport and Economic Interactions, Modelling Urban Transactional Activities in Labour and Housing Markets, Decision Support as Urban Intelligence, Participatory Governance and Planning Structures for the Smart City.

Are smart cities a panacea to Africa's quest for sustainable urbanization? Our analyses demonstrate that, if carefully planned and implemented, smart city interventions have the potential to transform the ways African cities are planned, managed, and governed. At the same time, smart city interventions in Africa are being implemented in contexts characterized by socio-economic inequalities, chaotic transport systems and massive governance failures among other challenges. We demonstrate that if ineffectively deployed, smart urban technologies might deepen existing inequalities and amplify spatial exclusion through privatization and marketization of urban space. Therefore, the adoption of smart city ideas in Africa must be rooted in contextual realities and properly calibrated to create urban spaces that are sustainable and inclusive.},

This paper draws on a review of interdisciplinary literature on regulatory governance and smart cities besides primary data collected from interviews with telecom and urban planning experts as well as regulatory members of staff to offer illustrations of the regulatory challenges and policy implications facing the development of smart cities with special focus on the state of Qatar. The paper emphasizes that regulatory policy-makers are required to go beyond the obvious and immediate benefits of smart cities to capture the full picture of potential impacts on regulatory and policy processes. For the transition towards smart cities to be handled successfully, regulatory policy-makers are required to address the new regulatory challenges by developing proactive rather than reactive approaches in dealing with the implementation of smart city initiatives.},

abstract = {This study examines how information and communication technology (ICT) complements carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to influence inclusive human development in forty-four Sub-Saharan African countries for the period 2000–2012. ICT is measured with internet penetration and mobile phone penetration. The empirical evidence is based on Generalised Method of Moments. The findings broadly show that ICT can be employed to dampen the potentially negative effect of environmental pollution on human development. We establish that: (i) ICT complements CO2 emissions from liquid fuel consumption to increase inclusive development; (ii) ICT interacts with CO2 intensity to negatively affect inclusive human development and (iii) the net effect on inclusive human development is positive from the complementarity between mobile phones and CO2 emissions per capita. Conversely, we also establish evidence of net negative effects. Fortunately, the corresponding ICT thresholds at which these net negative effects can be completely dampened are within policy range, notably: 50 (per 100 people) mobile phone penetration for CO2 emissions from liquid fuel consumption and CO2 intensity. Theoretical and policy implications are discussed.},

It is found that the definition of energy security is contextual and dynamic in nature. The scope of energy security has also expanded, with a growing emphasis on dimensions such as environmental sustainability and energy efficiency. Significant differences among studies are observed in the way in which energy security indexes are framed and constructed. These variations introduce challenges in comparing the findings among studies.

Does the adoption of information technology lead to massive regional unemployment? It is a crucial and unresolved issue for the government, enterprise employees, and researchers. Combining the 2005–2020 panel and the smart city (SC) construction policy in China, this article employs the difference in differences (DID) method to study the impact of informatization construction on labour spatial allocation. We found that informatization construction significantly attracted labour and improved labour spatial allocation. After the SC construction policy's implementation, compared with non-SCs, the average increase of SC pilots in the labour force is about 0.78 million people. Besides, stimulating economic growth, improving the environment, and enhancing public services are the mechanisms of the SC construction policy on labour spatial allocation. Furthermore, this policy effect has heterogeneous industry department and category characteristics. The Tertiary and secondary industry department receives a more significant impact.},

abstract = {Purpose: With the help of a quasi-natural experiment on Chinese policies, this study aims to understand the actual contribution of Smart City (SC) policies to the development of information and communications technology (ICT) in different cities. It also discusses the social and digital differences that such policies may generate, with a particular focus on the potential for exacerbating urban inequalities. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve this, the study employs a principal component analysis (PCA) to develop an ICT development indicator system. It then employs a difference-in-differences (DID) model to analyze panel data from 209 Chinese cities over the period from 2007 to 2019, examining the impact of SC policies on ICT development across various urban settings. Findings: Our findings show that SC policies have significantly contributed to the enhancement of ICT development, especially in ICT usage. However, SC policies may inadvertently reinforce developmental disparities among cities. Compared to less developed areas, the benefits of SC policies are more pronounced in economically booming cities. This is likely due to the agglomeration of the ICT industry and the strong allure of developed urban centers for high-caliber talent. Originality/value: This study contributes to the related literature by explaining the role of SC policies in driving ICT development and by focusing on the often-overlooked impact of SC policies on urban inequality. These findings can provide guidance to policymakers on the need to recognize and address existing urban inequalities.},

abstract = {The research aim was to test the Job Demand-Control (JDC) Model demands × Control interaction (or buffering) hypothesis in a simulated bus driving experiment. The buffering hypothesis was tested using a 2 (low and high demands) × 2 (low and high decision latitude) design with repeated measures on the second factor. A sample of 80 bus operators were randomly assigned to the low (n = 40) and high demands (n = 40) conditions. Demands were manipulated by increasing or reducing the number of stops to pick up passengers, and decision latitude by imposing or removing restrictions on the Rapid Transit Bus (BRT) operators' pace of work. Outcome variables include physiological markers (heart rate [HR], heart rate variability [HRV], breathing rate [BR], electromyography [EMG], and skin conductance [SC]), objective driving performance and self-report measurements of psychological wellbeing (psychological distress, interest/enjoyment [I/E], perceived competence, effort/importance [E/I], and pressure/tension [P/T]). It was found that job decision latitude moderates the effect of job demands on both physiological arousal (BR: F(1, 74) = 4.680, p = .034, SC: F(1, 75) = 6.769, p = .011, and EMG: F(1, 75) = 6.550, p = .013) and psychological well-being (P/T: F(1, 75) = 4.289, p = .042 and I/E: F(1, 74) = 4.548, p = .036). Consistently with the JDC model buffering hypothesis, the experimental findings suggest that increasing job decision latitude can moderate the negative effect of job demands on different psychophysiological outcomes. This finding is useful for designing organizational and clinical interventions in an occupational group at high risk of work stress-related disease.},

abstract = {Contact with green space in the environment has been associated with mental health benefits, but the mechanism underpinning this association is not clear. This study extends an earlier exploratory study showing that more green space in deprived urban neighbourhoods in Scotland is linked to lower levels of perceived stress and improved physiological stress as measured by diurnal patterns of cortisol secretion. Salivary cortisol concentrations were measured at 3, 6 and 9 h post awakening over two consecutive weekdays, together with measures of perceived stress. Participants (n = 106) were men and women not in work aged between 35-55 years, resident in socially disadvantaged districts from the same Scottish, UK, urban context as the earlier study. Results from linear regression analyses showed a significant and negative relationship between higher green space levels and stress levels, indicating living in areas with a higher percentage of green space is associated with lower stress, confirming the earlier study findings. This study further extends the findings by showing significant gender differences in stress patterns by levels of green space, with women in lower green space areas showing higher levels of stress. A significant interaction effect between gender and percentage green space on mean cortisol concentrations showed a positive effect of higher green space in relation to cortisol measures in women, but not in men. Higher levels of neighbourhood green space were associated with healthier mean cortisol levels in women whilst also attenuating higher cortisol levels in men. We conclude that higher levels of green space in residential neighbourhoods, for this deprived urban population of middle-aged men and women not in work, are linked with lower perceived stress and a steeper (healthier) diurnal cortisol decline. However, overall patterns and levels of cortisol secretion in men and women were differentially related to neighbourhood green space and warrant further investigation. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract = {The social ties between the residents of urban neighbourhoods are in decline due to changing work patterns, increased mobility and developments in communications. Neighbourhood open spaces, and green spaces in particular, provide opportunities for social interactions that may help the residents to establish recognition and develop relationships. This paper investigates the contribution of local parks to the development of social ties in inner-city neighbourhoods. Combining quantitative methods (questionnaire survey) with a qualitative approach (focus group discussions), the research was carried out in three inner-city neighbourhoods in Greater Manchester, UK, characterised by different levels of material deprivation and ethnic diversity. The social survey explored the associations between the respondents' visits to local parks and the number of friends and acquaintances they had. The findings suggest that local parks may support the development of social ties in inner-city areas. Associations were found between the quality of the parks, the character of visits, and the extent of social ties in the neighbourhood. The study concludes that for inner-city parks to realise their full potential in supporting social interactions and developing social ties, they need to be well-maintained and provide good recreational facilities. The development of social ties was also found to be considerably affected by the characteristics of the individuals and the neighbourhood. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The term “smart city” has been used synonymously with other terms, such as “digital city”, “sustainable city”, and “information city”, even though definitional distinctions exist between terms. In this review, we use “smart cities” as a catch-all term to refer to an emerging concept in urban governance practice and scholarship that has been increasingly applied to achieve public health aims. The objective of this systematic review was to document and analyze the inclusion of equity considerations and dimensions (i.e., a measurement, analytical, or dialectical focus on systematic disparities in health between groups) in smart city interventions aimed to improve human health and well-being. Systematic searches were carried out in the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Psychological Information Database (PsycINFO), the PubMed database from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, Elsevier's database Scopus, and Web of Science, returning 3219 titles. Ultimately, 28 articles were retained, assessed, and coded for their inclusion of equity characteristics using the Cochrane PROGRESS-Plus tool (referring to (P) place of residence, (R) race, (O) occupation, (G) gender, (R) religion, (E) education, (S) socio-economic status (SES), and (S) social capital). The most frequently included equity considerations in smart city health interventions were place of residence, SES, social capital, and personal characteristics; conversely, occupation, gender or sex, religion, race, ethnicity, culture, language, and education characteristics were comparatively less featured in such interventions. Overall, it appears that most of intervention evaluations assessed in this review are still in the early testing phases, and thus did not include or feature robust evaluative designs or commercially available technologies.},

abstract = {This paper is an examination of the splintering urbanism argument of the relationship between neo-liberal reforms of infrastructure networks and urban cohesion. Based on an analysis of historical and contemporary processes of infrastructure provision (water, sewerage and power) in colonial/post-colonial Bombay/Mumbai, it questions the assumption of a "modern infrastructure ideal" in the context of developing cities. In Mumbai, the historical analysis reveals the contradictions between this ideal and a hierarchical society. From the outset, access to services (particularly water and sewerage) was highly distorted in favour of the elites, even though utilities networks contributed to urban integration through cross-subsidies within and across sectors, and through the setting up of municipal institutions. Second, ongoing sectoral reforms demonstrate contrasting trends as increased differentiation of services produces both positive - better adaptation to users' needs - and potentially negative - fragmenting - socio-spatial implications. Third, an understudied potential fragmenting threat also lies in the sectoral approach to reforms as it undermines the existing crosssector subsidies and prevents the articulation of utility reforms with other limiting factors, such as land and transport, which are the main constraints for expanding housing and mobility in the city. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Design Automated double-blind randomised controlled trial with 6 months follow-up (2014-2015). Setting Smartphone-based. Participants 684 participants (daily smokers of cigarettes, 18 years old or over) recruited passively from app stores in the USA, Australia, UK and Singapore, and randomised to one of two sub-apps. Intervention(s) Behavioural, decision-aid, smartphone application. Main outcome(s) Continuous abstinence at 10 days, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months. Results Smokers who received the decision-aid app were more likely to be continuously abstinent at 1 month compared with the information-only app (28.5% vs 16.9%; relative risk (RR) 1.68; 95% CI 1.25 to 2.28). The effect was sustained at 3 months (23.8% vs 10.2%; RR 2.08; 95% CI 1.38 to 3.18) and 6 months (10.2% vs 4.8%; RR 2.02; 95% CI 1.08 to 3.81).

We identify central elements in the structure of the networks of connectivity between Bogot{\'{a}} and Soacha, highlighting the main gaps that lead to a fragmented set of connections.

abstract = {The central focus of this paper is on the differentiation of basic urban trading services in middle income cities and its role in service provision for the poor. Most studies dedicated to service delivery to the poor emphasize the inequalities pertaining from a growing differentiation in provision and take up some of the arguments of the splintering urbanism thesis. The paper examines some of the main claims made in this debate through a case study of Cape Town (South Africa). It illustrates how differentiation is implemented through service levels and tariffs and suggests that it is a pragmatic way of accommodating social and spatial disparities in a highly polarized city, while making progressive steps in favour of the poor. The main argument is that, in Cape Town like in many middle income cities, urban diversity restricts the relevance of conventional social policies and the scope of local solidarity with regard to service delivery. The differentiation of provision is thus a strategy to bring the diversity within the public service, and hence to preserve an institutional and financial public capacity of delivering subsidized services to the poor. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

abstract = {Objectives: To examine whether exposure to workplace stressors predicts changes in physical activity and the risk of insufficient physical activity. Methods: Prospective data from the Finnish Public Sector Study. Repeated exposure to low job control, high job demands, low effort, low rewards and compositions of these ( job strain and effort-reward imbalance) were assessed at Time 1 (2000-2002) and Time 2 (2004). Insufficient physical activity (<14 metabolic equivalent task hours per week) was measured at Time 1 and Time 3 (2008). The effect of change in workplace stressors on change in physical activity was examined using fixedeffects (within-subject) logistic regression models (N=6665). In addition, logistic regression analysis was applied to examine the associations between repeated exposure to workplace stressors and insufficient physical activity (N=13 976). In these analyses, coworker assessed workplace stressor scores were used in addition to individual level scores. Results: The proportion of participants with insufficient physical activity was 24% at baseline and 26% at follow-up. 19% of the participants who were sufficiently active at baseline became insufficiently active at followup. In the fixed-effect analysis, an increase in workplace stress was weakly related to an increase in physical inactivity within an individual. In between-subjects analysis, employees with repeated exposure to low job control and low rewards were more likely to be insufficiently active at follow-up than those with no reports of these stressors; fully adjusted ORs ranged from 1.11 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.24) to 1.21 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.39). Conclusions: Workplace stress is associated with a slightly increased risk of physical inactivity.},

abstract = {Although public health and urban planning emerged with the common goal of preventing urban outbreaks of infectious disease, there is little overlap between the fields today. The separation of the fields has contributed to uncoordinated efforts to address the health of urban populations and a general failure to recognize the links between, for example, the built environment and health disparities facing low-income populations and people of color. I review the historic connections and lack thereof between urban planning and public health, highlight some challenges facing efforts to recouple the fields, and suggest that insights from ecosocial theory and environmental justice offer a preliminary framework for reconnecting the fields around a social justice agenda.},

abstract = {There is a large and persistent association between education and health. In this paper, we review what is known about thislink.We first document the facts about the relationship between education and health. The education ‘gradient' isfound for both health behaviors and health status, though the former does not fully explain the latter. The effect of education increases with increasing years of education, with no evidence of a sheepskin effect. Nor are there differences between blacks and whites, or men and women. Gradients in behavior are biggest at young ages, and decline after age 50 or 60. We then consider differing reasons why education might be related to health. The obvious economic explanations – education isrelated to income or occupational choice – explain only a part of the education effect. We suggest that increasing levels of education lead to different thinking and decision-making patterns.Themonetaryvalue ofthe return to education in terms of health is perhaps half of the return to education on earnings,so policiesthat impact educational attainment could have a large effect on population health.},

abstract = {Smart homes for the aging population have recently started attracting the attention of the research community. The “health state” of smart homes is comprised of many different levels; starting with the physical health of citizens, it also includes longer-term health norms and outcomes, as well as the arena of positive behavior changes. One of the problems of interest is to monitor the activities of daily living (ADL) of the elderly, aiming at their protection and well-being. For this purpose, we installed passive infrared (PIR) sensors to detect motion in a specific area inside a smart apartment and used them to collect a set of ADL. In a novel approach, we describe a technology that allows the ground truth collected in one smart home to train activity recognition systems for other smart homes. We asked the users to label all instances of all ADL only once and subsequently applied data mining techniques to cluster in-home sensor firings. Each cluster would therefore represent the instances of the same activity. Once the clusters were associated to their corresponding activities, our system was able to recognize future activities. To improve the activity recognition accuracy, our system preprocessed raw sensor data by identifying overlapping activities. To evaluate the recognition performance from a 200-day dataset, we implemented three different active learning classification algorithms and compared their performance: naive Bayesian (NB), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). Based on our results, the RF classifier recognized activities with an average specificity of 96.53%, a sensitivity of 68.49%, a precision of 74.41% and an F-measure of 71.33%, outperforming both the NB and SVM classifiers. Further clustering markedly improved the results of the RF classifier. An activity recognition system based on PIR sensors in conjunction with a clustering classification approach was able to detect ADL from datasets collected from different homes. Thus, our PIR-based smart home technology could improve care and provide valuable information to better understand the functioning of our societies, as well as to inform both individual and collective action in a smart city scenario.},

abstract = {Background: Advanced lung cancer patients often have chronic lung disease with reduced exercise capacities and various symptoms leading to altered quality of life (QoL). No studies have assessed pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) employing a mobile app and an Internet of Things device in advanced lung cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Objective: This study aimed to determine the feasibility and efficacy of smartphone app-based PR on exercise capacity, symptom management, and QoL in patients with advanced lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Methods: A total of 100 patients were recruited in a prospective, single-arm intervention study using a smartphone app-based PR program for 12 weeks. Exercise capacity (6-min walking distance, 6MWD), QoL, symptom scale scores, and distress indexes were investigated. Results: A total of 90 patients completed the PR program. The most common cause of drop out was hospitalization because of cancer progression. After PR, there was significant improvement in the 6MWD; 380.1 m (SD 74.1) at baseline, 429.1 m (SD 58.6) at 6 weeks (P <.001), and 448.1 m (SD 50.0) at 12 weeks (P <.001). However, the dyspnea scale score showed no significant improvement in the patients overall, but there was a trend for improvement in those with a stable tumor response (P=.07). Role (P=.02), emotional (P <.001), and social functioning (P=.002) scale scores showed significant improvement after PR. Symptom scale scores for fatigue (P <.001), anorexia (P=.047), and diarrhea (P=.01) also showed significant improvement. There was significant improvement in depression (P=.048) and anxiety (P=.01), whereas there was no significant change in QoL (P=.06) and severity of pain (P=.24). Conclusions: Smartphone app-based PR represents an effective and feasible program to improve exercise capacity and to manage symptoms and distress in patients with advanced lung cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy.},

abstract = {Background: Recognizing and appropriately treating mental health problems among new immigrants and refugees in primary care poses a challenge because of differences in language and culture and because of specific stressors associated with migration and resettlement. We aimed to identify risk factors and strategies in the approach to mental health assessment and to prevention and treatment of common mental health problems for immigrants in primary care. Methods: We searched and compiled literature on prevalence and risk factors for common mental health problems related to migration, the effect of cultural influences on health and illness, and clinical strategies to improve mental health care for immigrants and refugees. Publications were selected on the basis of relevance, use of recent data and quality in consultation with experts in immigrant and refugee mental health. Results: The migration trajectory can be divided into three components: premigration, migration and postmigration resettlement. Each phase is associated with specific risks and exposures. The prevalence of specific types of mental health problems is influenced by the nature of the migration experience, in terms of adversity experienced before, during and after resettlement. Specific challenges in migrant mental health include communication difficulties because of language and cultural differences; the effect of cultural shaping of symptoms and illness behaviour on diagnosis, coping and treatment; differences in family structure and process affecting adaptation, acculturation and intergenerational conflict; and aspects of acceptance by the receiving society that affect employment, social status and integration. These issues can be addressed through specific inquiry, the use of trained interpreters and culture brokers, meetings with families, and consultation with community organizations. Interpretation: Systematic inquiry into patients' migration trajectory and subsequent follow-up on culturally appropriate indicators of social, vocational and family functioning over time will allow clinicians to recognize problems in adaptation and undertake mental health promotion, disease prevention or treatment interventions in a timely way. {\textcopyright} 2011 Canadian Medical Association or its licensors.},

abstract = {The response of immigrants to new societies is dynamic. There may be an initial period of happiness followed by peaks of stressful periods. These reactions along with socio-economic changes are likely to influence their health, which may start converging towards the average health of the host population. We used a longitudinal analysis to assess the differences in health outcomes (mental health and self-rated health), separately in men and women, in Canadian born and immigrants over a 12-year period (and the associated socio-economic factors). We used random effects logistic regression models for evaluation of these health outcomes in 3,081 men and 4,187 women from the National Population Health Survey (1994/ 95 to 2006/07). After adjusting for all the covariates, nonwhite immigrants were less likely to have severe psychological distress compared with the Canadian born individuals [odds ratio (OR) Men: 0.49, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.24-1.00, Women-OR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.32-0.92]. Immigrant women (white and non-white) were more likely to rate their health as poor through this 12-year period than the Canadian born women (White-OR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.17-2.64; Non-white-OR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.01-3.28). Immigrants in the lowest income adequacy category reported higher psychological distress and poorer health than those in the highest income categories. We did not find any significant differences in the mental health and self-rated health of Canadian men and white male immigrants throughout this 12-year period. Though, non-white immigrant women were less likely to have severe psychological distress through this 12 year period, they were the ones most likely to rate their health as poor. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.},

abstract = {Autism is a complex developmental disorder that affects approximately 1 in 68 children (according to the recent survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—CDC) in the U.S., and has become the fastest growing category of special education. Each student with autism comes with her or his own unique needs and an array of behaviors and habits that can be severe and which interfere with everyday tasks. Autism is associated with intellectual disability, impairments in social skills, and physical health issues such as sleep and abdominal disturbances. We have designed an Internet-of-Things (IoT) framework named WearSense that leverages the sensing capabilities of modern smartwatches to detect stereotypic behaviors in children with autism. In this work, we present a study that used the inbuilt accelerometer of a smartwatch to detect three behaviors, including hand flapping, painting, and sibbing that are commonly observed in children with autism. In this feasibility study, we recruited 14 subjects to record the accelerometer data from the smartwatch worn on the wrist. The processing part extracts 34 different features in each dimension of the three-axis accelerometer, resulting in 102 features. Using and comparing various classification techniques revealed that an ensemble of 40 decision trees has the best accuracy of around 94.6%. This accuracy shows the quality of the data collected from the smartwatch and feature extraction methods used in this study. The recognition of these behaviors by using a smartwatch would be helpful in monitoring individuals with autistic behaviors, since the smartwatch can send the data to the cloud for comprehensive analysis and also to help parents, caregivers, and clinicians make informed decisions.},

abstract = {Background: EDUCERE ("Ubiquitous Detection Ecosystem to Care and Early Stimulation for Children with Developmental Disorders") is an ecosystem for ubiquitous detection, care, and early stimulation of children with developmental disorders. The objectives of this Spanish government-funded research and development project are to investigate, develop, and evaluate innovative solutions to detect changes in psychomotor development through the natural interaction of children with toys and everyday objects, and perform stimulation and early attention activities in real environments such as home and school. Thirty multidisciplinary professionals and three nursery schools worked in the EDUCERE project between 2014 and 2017 and they obtained satisfactory results. Related to EDUCERE, we found studies based on providing networks of connected smart objects and the interaction between toys and social networks. Objective: This research includes the design, implementation, and validation of an EDUCERE smart toy aimed to automatically detect delays in psychomotor development. The results from initial tests led to enhancing the effectiveness of the original design and deployment. The smart toy, based on stackable cubes, has a data collector module and a smart system for detection of developmental delays, called the EDUCERE developmental delay screening system (DDSS). Methods: The pilot study involved 65 toddlers aged between 23 and 37 months (mean=29.02, SD 3.81) who built a tower with five stackable cubes, designed by following the EDUCERE smart toy model. As toddlers made the tower, sensors in the cubes sent data to a collector module through a wireless connection. All trials were video-recorded for further analysis by child development experts. After watching the videos, experts scored the performance of the trials to compare and fine-Tune the interpretation of the data automatically gathered by the toy-embedded sensors. Results: Judges were highly reliable in an interrater agreement analysis (intraclass correlation 0.961, 95% CI 0.937-0.967), suggesting that the process was successful to separate different levels of performance. A factor analysis of collected data showed that three factors, trembling, speed, and accuracy, accounted for 76.79% of the total variance, but only two of them were predictors of performance in a regression analysis: Accuracy (P=.001) and speed (P=.002). The other factor, trembling (P=.79), did not have a significant effect on this dependent variable. Conclusions: The EDUCERE DDSS is ready to use the regression equation obtained for the dependent variable "performance" as an algorithm for the automatic detection of psychomotor developmental delays. The results of the factor analysis are valuable to simplify the design of the smart toy by taking into account only the significant variables in the collector module. The fine-Tuning of the toy process module will be carried out by following the specifications resulting from the analysis of the data to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the product.},

abstract = {Background: Measuring disease and injury burden in populations requires a composite metric that captures both premature mortality and the prevalence and severity of ill-health. The 1990 Global Burden of Disease study proposed disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to measure disease burden. No comprehensive update of disease burden worldwide incorporating a systematic reassessment of disease and injury-specific epidemiology has been done since the 1990 study. We aimed to calculate disease burden worldwide and for 21 regions for 1990, 2005, and 2010 with methods to enable meaningful comparisons over time. Methods: We calculated DALYs as the sum of years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs). DALYs were calculated for 291 causes, 20 age groups, both sexes, and for 187 countries, and aggregated to regional and global estimates of disease burden for three points in time with strictly comparable definitions and methods. YLLs were calculated from age-sex-country-time-specific estimates of mortality by cause, with death by standardised lost life expectancy at each age. YLDs were calculated as prevalence of 1160 disabling sequelae, by age, sex, and cause, and weighted by new disability weights for each health state. Neither YLLs nor YLDs were age-weighted or discounted. Uncertainty around cause-specific DALYs was calculated incorporating uncertainty in levels of all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, prevalence, and disability weights. Findings: Global DALYs remained stable from 1990 (2{\textperiodcentered}503 billion) to 2010 (2{\textperiodcentered}490 billion). Crude DALYs per 1000 decreased by 23% (472 per 1000 to 361 per 1000). An important shift has occurred in DALY composition with the contribution of deaths and disability among children (younger than 5 years of age) declining from 41% of global DALYs in 1990 to 25% in 2010. YLLs typically account for about half of disease burden in more developed regions (high-income Asia Pacific, western Europe, high-income North America, and Australasia), rising to over 80% of DALYs in sub-Saharan Africa. In 1990, 47% of DALYs worldwide were from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders, 43% from non-communicable diseases, and 10% from injuries. By 2010, this had shifted to 35%, 54%, and 11%, respectively. Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of DALYs worldwide in 2010 (up from fourth rank in 1990, increasing by 29%), followed by lower respiratory infections (top rank in 1990; 44% decline in DALYs), stroke (fifth in 1990; 19% increase), diarrhoeal diseases (second in 1990; 51% decrease), and HIV/AIDS (33rd in 1990; 351% increase). Major depressive disorder increased from 15th to 11th rank (37% increase) and road injury from 12th to 10th rank (34% increase). Substantial heterogeneity exists in rankings of leading causes of disease burden among regions. Interpretation: Global disease burden has continued to shift away from communicable to non-communicable diseases and from premature death to years lived with disability. In sub-Saharan Africa, however, many communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders remain the dominant causes of disease burden. The rising burden from mental and behavioural disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, and diabetes will impose new challenges on health systems. Regional heterogeneity highlights the importance of understanding local burden of disease and setting goals and targets for the post-2015 agenda taking such patterns into account. Because of improved definitions, methods, and data, these results for 1990 and 2010 supersede all previously published Global Burden of Disease results.},

abstract = {Objective: This review is aimed at assessing the quality of questionnaires and their development process based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) change model. Methods: A systematic literature search for studies with the primary aim of TPB-based questionnaire development was conducted in relevant databases between 2002 and 2012 using selected search terms. Ten of 1,034 screened abstracts met the inclusion criteria and were assessed for methodological quality using two different appraisal tools: one for the overall methodological quality of each study and the other developed for the appraisal of the questionnaire content and development process. Both appraisal tools consisted of items regarding the likelihood of bias in each study and were eventually combined to give the overall quality score for each included study. Results: 8 of the 10 included studies showed low risk of bias in the overall quality assessment of each study, while 9 of the studies were of high quality based on the quality appraisal of questionnaire content and development process. Conclusion: Quality appraisal of the questionnaires in the 10 reviewed studies was successfully conducted, highlighting the top problem areas (including: sample size estimation; inclusion of direct and indirect measures; and inclusion of questions on demographics) in the development of TPB-based questionnaires and the need for researchers to provide a more detailed account of their development process. {\textcopyright} 2014 Oluka et al.},

In this article, we present BeWell+ the next generation of the BeWell smartphone wellbeing app, which monitors user behavior along three health dimensions, namely sleep, physical activity, and social interaction. BeWell promotes improved behavioral patterns via feedback rendered as an ambient display on the smartphone's wallpaper. With BeWell+, we introduce new mechanisms to address key limitations of the original BeWell app; specifically, (1) community adaptive wellbeing feedback, which generalizes to diverse user communities (e.g.; elderly, children) by promoting better behavior yet remains realistic to the user's lifestyle; and, (2) wellbeing adaptive energy allocation, which prioritizes monitoring fidelity and feedback responsiveness on specific health dimensions (e.g.; sleep) where the user needs additional help. We evaluate BeWell+ with a 27 person, 19 day field trial. Our findings show that not only can BeWell+ operate successfully on consumer smartphones; but also users understand feedback and respond by taking steps towards leading healthier lifestyles. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

This 'cause deleted' life expectancy was highly correlated with homicide rates; a measure of economic inequality added significant additional prediction, whereas median household income did not. Deaths from internal causes (diseases) show similar age patterns, despite different absolute levels, in the best and worst neighbourhoods, whereas deaths from external causes (homicide, accident, suicide) do not. As life expectancy declines across neighbourhoods, women reproduce earlier; by age 30, however, neighbourhood no longer affects age specific fertility. These results support the hypothesis that life expectancy itself may be a psychologically salient determinant of risk taking and the timing of life transitions.},

This systematic review aimed to determine the effectiveness of mHealth interventions on behavioural lifestyle changes and medication adherence for cardiovascular disease self-management. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted from inception through to 3 March 2015 using MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library. Eligible studies used an experimental trial design to determine the effectiveness of an mHealth intervention to change lifestyle behaviours in any cardiovascular disease population. Data extracted included intervention and comparison group characteristics with a specific focus on the use of behaviour change techniques. Results Seven studies met our inclusion criteria and were included in the qualitative synthesis. All interventions were delivered in part by mobile phone text messaging. Three studies were effective at improving adherence to medication and two studies increased physical activity behaviour. No effects were observed on dietary behaviour or smoking cessation, measured in one study each. Simple text messaging interventions appeared to be most effective; however, no clear relationships were found between study findings and intervention dose, duration or behaviour change techniques targeted. Conclusions Our review found mHealth has the potential to change lifestyle behaviour. Results are still limited to a small number of trials, inconsistent outcome measures and ineffective reporting of intervention characteristics. Large scale, longitudinal studies are now warranted to gain a clear understanding of the effects of mHealth on behaviour change in the cardiovascular disease population.},

abstract = {Debates about the future of urban development in many Western countries have been increasingly influenced by discussions of smart cities. Yet despite numerous examples of this 'urban labelling' phenomenon, we know surprisingly little about so-called smart cities, particularly in terms of what the label ideologically reveals as well as hides. Due to its lack of definitional precision, not to mention an underlying self-congratulatory tendency, the main thrust of this article is to provide a preliminary critical polemic against some of the more rhetorical aspects of smart cities. The primary focus is on the labelling process adopted by some designated smart cities, with a view to problematizing a range of elements that supposedly characterize this new urban form, as well as question some of the underlying assumptions/ contradictions hidden within the concept. To aid this critique, the article explores to what extent labelled smart cities can be understood as a high-tech variation of the 'entrepreneurial city', as well as speculates on some general principles which would make them more progressive and inclusive.},

The framework combines ideation cards, worksheets and facilitated co-design, guiding non-experts to conceptually connect personal data, health/wellbeing goals, plants and people. We demonstrate how the framework enabled participants to envisage 'connected' plants, linking personal data outputs with inputs to actuated growing environments, creating biofeedback. From the results of design work carried out by participants, we synthesise and present four themes. The themes provide a spectrum of values that participants embedded in their connected plants, and in the act of gifting their connected plants to other people. The results of these workshops signpost a new design space for personal data embodied in plants that could be taken forward by the DIS community. Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract = {Background: Physical activity helps people maintain a healthy weight and reduces the risk for several chronic diseases. Although this knowledge is widely recognized, adults and children in many countries around the world do not get recommended amounts of physical activity. Although many interventions are found to be ineffective at increasing physical activity or reaching inactive populations, there have been anecdotal reports of increased physical activity due to novel mobile games that embed game play in the physical world. The most recent and salient example of such a game is Pok{\'{e}}mon Go, which has reportedly reached tens of millions of users in the United States and worldwide. Objective: The objective of this study was to quantify the impact of Pok{\'{e}}mon Go on physical activity. Methods: We study the effect of Pok{\'{e}}mon Go on physical activity through a combination of signals from large-scale corpora of wearable sensor data and search engine logs for 32,000 Microsoft Band users over a period of 3 months. Pok{\'{e}}mon Go players are identified through search engine queries and physical activity is measured through accelerometers. Results: We find that Pok{\'{e}}mon Go leads to significant increases in physical activity over a period of 30 days, with particularly engaged users (ie, those making multiple search queries for details about game usage) increasing their activity by 1473 steps a day on average, a more than 25% increase compared with their prior activity level (P<.001). In the short time span of the study, we estimate that Pok{\'{e}}mon Go has added a total of 144 billion steps to US physical activity. Furthermore, Pok{\'{e}}mon Go has been able to increase physical activity across men and women of all ages, weight status, and prior activity levels showing this form of game leads to increases in physical activity with significant implications for public health. In particular, we find that Pok{\'{e}}mon Go is able to reach low activity populations, whereas all 4 leading mobile health apps studied in this work largely draw from an already very active population. Conclusions: Mobile apps combining game play with physical activity lead to substantial short-term activity increases and, in contrast to many existing interventions and mobile health apps, have the potential to reach activity-poor populations. Future studies are needed to investigate potential long-term effects of these applications.},

A longitudinal design was used, with a Control Group (n = 103) that did not use Pok{\'{e}}mon GO, and Experimental Group (n = 87) that used Pok{\'{e}}mon GO during 8 weeks. Age, sex, BMI, maternal educational level, number of computers at home and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were used as confounders. Results showed that players walked 54 km and spent 40 min/day playing in this period. Boys played more, won more points and reached a higher level in the game than girls. The players playing Pok{\'{e}}mon GO significantly increased their selective attention (p = 0.003), concentration levels (p < 0.001), and sociability levels (p = 0.003) against their peers. It is concluded that Pok{\'{e}}mon GO increases, in a playful way, the amount of daily exercise in adolescents, could positively affect their cognitive performance, and improve the social relationships. Further studies are required to perform comparisons between single and collaborative play and to identify the pedagogical benefits through some subjects such as Physical Education.},

abstract = {The emergence of ubiquitous sensing and the Internet of Things (IoT) have inspired the development of 'smart' everyday objects, which offer tremendous opportunities for maintaining the quality of life in ambient assisted living (AAL) environments. Inspired by the future possibilities of connected everyday devices, we envision a peripheral activity-based awareness system that captures human activity information and renders this information to enhance context awareness and support social connectedness between the elderly and their caregivers. Leveraging ambient intelligence and IoT technologies, ambient displays can convey activity information in the periphery of our attention. In particular, light has been used as a means to display ambient information and there is scientific evidence that it can enhance well-being, interconnectedness, and improve productivity. In this paper, we undertake two studies, first through an exploratory study we investigate the features of light suitable for conveying subtle activity information within the periphery of the users' attention for promoting context awareness. Also, we examine the preferences, perceptions, and interpretations of ambient lighting configurations of prospective caregiver's for conveying the activity information of older adults. In a second study, we assess the implications of activity awareness through lighting on cognitive performance, moods, and social connectedness. The set-up and design decisions of the second study were partly informed by previous research and by the outcomes of the first experiment. Together, these studies provide additional design guidelines for representing activity information with ambient lighting and highlight potential benefits and usage possibilities for lighting displays within the AAL domain. Furthermore, the results indicate a significant effect of activity awareness on cognitive performance. However, there were no significant effects of activity awareness through lighting on moods and social connectedness. Finally, we discuss the design guidelines and implications of these findings for designing activity-based ambient lighting displays for AAL environments.},

Solutions to mitigate this challenge include the use of IoT and software solutions to minimise the effort of elderly care, in care centres and at home. To accomplish this, we set to quantify what are the most important elderly care metrics (i.e., what is important to support caregivers' work) through field observations and interviews at a local care centre housing 14 old adults. We designed iteratively and evaluated the usefulness of a mobile application with 8 caregivers, to summarise and communicate the care metrics, juxtaposed with wellbeing data (e.g., social interaction, mobility and others), part of a larger elderly care support platform, CARE. The goal of the mobile application is to enable a better care service by raising awareness to daily needs and routines of the elderly and to provide quick access to their wellbeing information. Our findings advocate that our design could positively benefit the care personnel and assist them carrying out the daily duties at the care centre.},

abstract = {A challenge associated with an ageing population is increased demand on health and social care, creating a greater need to enable persons to live independently in their own homes. Ambient assistant living technology aims to address this by monitoring occupants' ‘activities of daily living' using smart home sensors to alert caregivers to abnormalities in routine tasks and deteriorations in a person's ability to care for themselves. However, there has been less focus on using sensing technology to monitor a broader scope of so-called ‘meaningful activities', which promote a person's emotional, creative, intellectual, and spiritual needs. In this paper, we describe the development of a toolkit comprised of off-the-shelf, affordable sensors to allow persons with dementia and Parkinson's disease to monitor meaningful activities as well as activities of daily living in order to self-manage their life and well-being. We describe two evaluations of the toolkit, firstly a lab-based study to test the installation of the system including the acuity and placement of sensors and secondly, an in-the-wild study where subjects who were not target users of the toolkit, but who identified as technology enthusiasts evaluated the feasibility of the toolkit to monitor activities in and around real homes. Subjects from the in-the-wild study reported minimal obstructions to installation and were able to carry out and enjoy activities without obstruction from the sensors, revealing that meaningful activities may be monitored remotely using affordable, passive sensors. We propose that our toolkit may enhance assistive living systems by monitoring a wider range of activities than activities of daily living.},

The design process of Pen-Pen includes a series of inquiries, which identified “support for relaxation” and “location based arrival notification” as desires of commuters, and “mindfulness” and feelings of “autonomy” as relevant determinants of commuters' wellbeing. We evaluated Pen-Pen in the field with five commuters, and through an online survey with 68 participants. Our results indicate that using Pen-Pen has the potential to increase feelings of rest and autonomy, and to foster mindfulness through the feedback loop which feeds back spatial audio based on user location and finger touch. Especially commuters who reported to be less mindful and easily stressed anticipate Pen-Pen to be useful for them.},

The in-car environment incorporates a basic state that uses color to relax or energize the driver, and an exploratory state that intends to immerse the user into a simulated environment. In the exploratory state, the user plays with a tangible input device allowing the simulated environment to appear. This environment includes images and sounds related to a certain theme. Our preliminary research findings reveal that users felt significantly calmer and marginally significantly better after interacting with the simulated environment. Results from the semi-structured interviews demonstrated that the majority of people appreciated the system and thought it might be effective to support unwinding. These outcomes demonstrate potential in the concept, but testing in a more realistic setting is necessary. {\textcopyright} 2013 ACM.},

In this paper, we present the conceptual design of AutoGym and report what we have learnt from an explorative user study with 28 participants. Furthermore, from the design process and the evaluation, we derived three strategies for implementing exertion games.

Asthma can significantly impact a patient's quality of life. Asthma action plans are said to be one of the most effective asthma interventions available. However, in Australia only one in five people aged 15 and over, with asthma, have a written asthma action plan. Even less of which, refer to their plan. A review of related literature and work showed a gap regarding accessibility of information on asthma action plans in a written form. In an attempt to mitigate this problem, this paper focuses on the design and development of a smartphone application. The application is currently a high-fidelity prototype designed and built using proto.io.software. In addition to this conversion, the application incorporates aspects of the Internet of Things (IoT) whereby realtime data regarding environmental triggers such as temperature, humidity and pollen in surroundings, can be accessed from the application. The application ultimately aims to help asthmatics improve their health and quality of life by providing them, or their carer with the knowledge needed to better understand and manage their asthma, when and where they need it.},

abstract = {Links between wellbeing and environmental factors are of growing interest in psychology, health, conservation, economics, and more widely. There is limited evidence that green or natural environments are positive for physical and mental health and wellbeing. We present a new and unique primary research study exploring the relationship between momentary subjective wellbeing (SWB) and individuals' immediate environment within the UK. We developed and applied an innovative data collection tool: a smartphone app that signals participants at random moments, presenting a brief questionnaire while using satellite positioning (GPS) to determine geographical coordinates. We used this to collect over one million responses from more than 20,000 participants. Associating GPS response locations with objective spatial data, we estimate a model relating land cover to SWB using only the within-individual variation, while controlling for weather, daylight, activity, companionship, location type, time, day, and any response trend. On average, study participants are significantly and substantially happier outdoors in all green or natural habitat types than they are in urban environments. These findings are robust to a number of alternative models and model specifications. This study provides a new line of evidence on links between nature and wellbeing, strengthening existing evidence of a positive relationship between SWB and exposure to green or natural environments in daily life. Our results have informed the UK National Ecosystem Assessment (NEA), and the novel geo-located experience sampling methodology we describe has great potential to provide new insights in a range of areas of interest to policymakers. {\textcopyright} 2013 .},

The tool was used to monitor 108 individuals who completed 3013 assessments over a 1-week period. Significant immediate and lagged associations with mental well-being were found for several natural features. These associations were stronger in people with higher trait impulsivity, a psychological measure of one's tendency to behave with little forethought or consideration of the consequences, which is indicative of a higher risk of developing mental-health issues. Our investigation suggests that the benefits of nature on mental well-being are time-lasting and interact with an individual's vulnerability to mental illness. These findings have potential implications from the perspectives of global mental health as well as urban planning and design.},

abstract = {Objective To assess the effectiveness of mHealth interventions for maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH) in low- and middle- income countries (LMIC). Methods 16 online international databases were searched to identify studies evaluating the impact of mHealth interventions on MNCH outcomes in LMIC, between January 1990 and May 2014. Comparable studies were included in a random-effects meta-analysis. Findings Of 8593 unique references screened after de-duplication, 15 research articles and two conference abstracts met inclusion criteria, including 12 intervention and three observational studies. Only two studies were graded at low risk of bias. Only one study demonstrated an improvement in morbidity or mortality, specifically decreased risk of perinatal death in children of mothers who received SMS support during pregnancy, compared with routine prenatal care. Meta-analysis of three studies on infant feeding showed that prenatal interventions using SMS/cell phone (vs routine care) improved rates of breastfeeding (BF) within one hour after birth (odds ratio (OR) 2.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27-2.75, I2 = 80.9%) and exclusive BF for three/four months (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.26-2.50, I2 = 52.8%) and for six months (OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.46-3.68, I2 = 0.0%). Included studies encompassed interventions designed for health information delivery (n = 6); reminders (n = 3); communication (n = 2); data collection (n = 2); test result turnaround (n = 2); peer group support (n = 2) and psychological intervention (n = 1). Conclusions Most studies of mHealth for MNCH in LMIC are of poor methodological quality and few have evaluated impacts on patient outcomes. Improvements in intermediate outcomes have nevertheless been reported in many studies and there is modest evidence that interventions delivered via SMS messaging can improve infant feeding. Ambiguous descriptions of interventions and their mechanisms of impact present difficulties for interpretation and replication. Rigorous studies with potential to offer clearer evidence are underway.},

abstract = {Study objective: To propose a definition of health equity to guide operationalisation and measurement, and to discuss the practical importance of clarity in defining this concept. Design: Conceptual discussion. Setting, Patients/Participants, and Main results: not applicable. Conclusions: For the purposes of measurement and operationalisation, equity in health is the absence of systematic disparities in health (or in the major social determinants of health) between groups with different levels of underlying social advantage/disadvantoge - that is, wealth, power, or prestige. Inequities in health systematically put groups of people who are already socially disadvantaged (for example, by virtue of being poor, female, and/or members of a disenfranchised racial, ethnic, or religious group) at further disadvantage with respect to their health; health is essential to wellbeing and to overcoming other effects of social disadvantage. Equity is an ethical principle; it also is consonant with and closely related to human rights principles. The proposed definition of equity supports operationalisation of the right to the highest attainable standard of health as indicated by the health status of the most socially advantaged group. Assessing health equity requires comparing health and its social determinants between more and less advantaged social groups. These comparisons are essential to assess whether national and international policies are leading toward or away from greater social justice in health.},

They represent environments that enable superior cognitive capabilities and creativity to be collectively constructed from combinations of individual cognitive skills and information systems that operate in the physical, institutional, and digital spaces of cities. Two academic traditions have been feeding the discussion concerning intelligent communities and cities: the literature on innovative environments and the planning of digital cities. Following an introduction on the meaning of ICs, we discuss the structuring of innovative environments such as clusters, technology districts and territorial systems of innovation, which rely on different architectures of knowledge networks enhancing product, process, and organizational innovation. Then we turn to digital cities and examine their concept, architecture, and constituent elements. In the final section of the paper we describe intelligent cities as overlapping of innovative clusters and digital cities. Intelligent cities integrate knowledge-intensive activities and clusters; embedded routines of social cooperation enabling knowledge sharing and innovation; advanced communication infrastructure and digital spaces for knowledge and innovation management; and proven ability to innovate and resolve problems that appear for the first time, since the capacity to innovate and manage uncertainty are critical factors in characterizing intelligence.},

Much more than a technical and practical issue, the digital city has dimensions that are social, cultural, political, ideological, and of course also theoretical. I explore these broader conceptual underpinnings of the digital city idea. More specifically: where do urban ideologies, urban structures and functions, and digital urban representations meet? How may the digital city relate to the real city? On the basis of what choices might the digital city be constructed? What might the digital city mean to people? To be answered, these highly involved and interrelated questions require a coherent conceptual framework. By considering an overview of digital-city realizations, issues, and critiques, I adumbrate a theory of the digital city, seen as lying at the intersection of three domains: a physical urban area, the communities of people associated with that area, and the possibilities and constraints (technological, but also socioeconomic and ideological) of the evolving information society. A rough sketch is all that can be offered at this point because proper theories of the digital city cannot be developed independently of comprehensive theories of the real 21st-century city. I close with a brief discussion of what these ideas might imply for digital-city designers.},

abstract = {The concept of Smart City embraces several definitions depending on the meanings of the word “smart”: intelligent city, knowledge city, ubiquitous city, sustainable city, digital city, etc. Many definitions of Smart City exist, but no one has been universally acknowledged yet. From literature analysis it emerges that Smart City and Digital City are the most used terminologies in literature to indicate the smartness of a city. This Chapter explores the literature about Smart City and Digital City from 1993 to the end of 2012 in order to investigate how these two concepts were born, how they have developed, which are the shared features and differences between them. To accomplish with these goals, three steps were followed: (1) to set up a search strategy for systematic literature review to collect a representative subset of papers about Smart City and Digital City using Google Scholar; (2) to store the selected subset in an ad-doc database to synthesize the literature review; (3) to organize the literature review subset to extract quantitative and qualitative data and information about Smart City and Digital City evolution. The author proposes a literature review taxonomy through five specific analysis: (1) time analysis, to explore the causes of the trend of Smart City and Digital City literature in the latest twenty years; (2) terminology analysis, to examine how and where these two ideas were born and what have been the main events influenced their development; (3) definitions analysis, to select and compare the most cited and validated definitions of Smart City and Digital City trying to identify similarities, differences or overlaps between these two concepts; (4) typology analysis, to investigate if Smart City and Digital City are included into a specific urban strategy pursued by government or if they face specific urban problems without a comprehensive framework; (5) geographic analysis, to understand where are the largest concentrations of Smart Cities and Digital Cities in the world and which are their main characteristics and best practices.},

abstract = {Governments everywhere must focus on rethinking service delivery as inclusive involvement in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) procedures for smart services has become unavoidable. Metropolitan municipalities in South Africa have joined the technology revolution that embraces smart services delivery through various ICTs and advances the idea of e-governance using the Stakeholder Inclusive Approach. To comprehend how the City of Johannesburg (CoJ) encourages inclusion in smart services, the researchers use an explorative qualitative design that works well with the inclusive stakeholder approach, which supports a collaborative process in ICT adoption. The study discovered through qualitative thematic analysis that inclusiveness is a comprehensive process that considers the demands of different stakeholders in the adoption and implementation of ICT. One issue that leads to ICT efficiencies in the CoJ is data fragmentation from numerous municipal agencies. Inclusionary participation has been widespread in virtual Integrated Development Planning (IDP) forums and other cutting-edge services provided by the CoJ. There have been some exceptional examples of free wifi supply. The study's conclusion reiterates the importance of comprehensive inclusion in ICT adoption and implementation as it links communities with the municipality and stresses the need for city officials to commit to upskilling programmes to improve the delivery of public goods and services delivery.

abstract = {The dawn of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) demands that government departments in South Africa be prepared to adopt ICTs and related digital technologies to achieve smart service delivery. Smart service delivery in government includes leveraging ICT, smart digital technologies, business processes, and models to enhance efciency in public service delivery. The study draws from the Difusion of Innovation (DoI) Theory and the Technology Organisation Environment (TOE) framework, which help to understand the acceptance rate of using ICTs in the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality (herein referred to as the CoJ). A construc- tivist paradigm, based on an explorative qualitative design that adopts interviews was used to identify sixteen participants from four diferent departments in the CoJ. The rationale was to assess whether the CoJ efciently utilising ICTs to increase deci- sion making, improve communication with citizens, uphold accountability and enhance smart service delivery in the 4IR. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data. The study's fndings reveal that the CoJ has rolled out various ICTs to increase institutional efciency towards attaining smart service delivery through its Smart City ofce. However, several challenges that include socio-economic disparities, digital illiteracy, gender inequalities, social norms, rapid urbanisation, high unemployment, and social exclusion adversely afect the CoJ in fully rolling out ICTs in communities. The conclusions drawn from the study indi- cate that poor municipal governance, and lack of accountability and efcient leader- ship adversely afect the City's capacity to attain smart service delivery in the 4IR. The study recommends that the CoJ enhance its skills development programmes to capaci- tate and encourage city ofcials to adopt modern ICTs and smart digital technologies to increase citizens' access to information and improve coordination, transparency, and accountability.},

abstract = {The fourth industrial revolution (4IR) may fundamentally alter, not only the way people work but also, how Small and Medium (SME) manufacturing businesses operate. In the manufacturing sector, the 4IR may change the design; manufacturing; operations; services, products, and production systems; connectivity; and the interaction among parts, machines, and people. While the 4IR technologies may have many benefits, owing to innovation and technological progress, the manufacturing SMEs require their challenges to be addressed before they may benefit from 4IR technologies. To the best of the knowledge of the researchers, there is no conceptual 4IR manufacturing framework, specifically for a developing economy, which is necessary for addressing these challenges and the opportunities promised by the new industry. This research, therefore, intends to fill this gap by developing a conceptual 4IR framework to assist South African manufacturing SMEs in addressing some of these challenges. Following a comprehensive literature review, components of the 4IR and challenges in the manufacturing industry are elucidated, aimed at defining a set of qualitative propositions as our instrument to develop a conceptual framework for embedding 4IR technologies and opportunities in the manufacturing industry. Further aspects of the framework enable businesses to gain a competitive advantage and sustainable business performance. Future work in this area will validate the framework among stakeholders in the manufacturing industry within the context of a developing economy.},

abstract = {A study conducted by UN Habitat (2020) revealed that financing of investment in African growing cities has become an impediment amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Close to USD 93 billion is needed to finance urban development in Africa. The prevalence of COVID-19 pandemic impacted negatively on the independence of African cities to raise revenue or incur long-term debt to finance their development. Several local governments in African cities are not positioned enough to ensure quality standards of living for their people. This is because many local authorities in African cities cannot intervene in various emergencies or crises which pose a danger to people given the COVID-19 pandemic era where strategic government interventions are essential to save the lives of the people. Burdened by the need to respond to COVID-19, many African governments have diverted their attention from the smart city ideology which demands stable financial revenues and redirected their efforts towards mitigating the scourge of the pandemic. Drawing from this background, therefore this chapter reports on the three selected African cities (Johannesburg, Lagos and Accra) because of their experiences regarding COVID-19, and their responses to the pandemic towards achieving a smart city in Africa. The chapter is guided by the following specific objectives: To examine the unintended consequences of COVID-19 on the achievement of Smart Cities in three African Cities; to assess the opportunities and challenges of achieving smart cities amid COVID 19 in three African Cities; and to determine how rapid urbanisation affects the achievement of Smart Cities amid COVID-19 in three African Cities. Qualitative thematic analysis was used to analyse data acquired from secondary sources.},

abstract = {Contact with green space in the environment has been associated with mental health benefits, but the mechanism underpinning this association is not clear. This study extends an earlier exploratory study showing that more green space in deprived urban neighbourhoods in Scotland is linked to lower levels of perceived stress and improved physiological stress as measured by diurnal patterns of cortisol secretion. Salivary cortisol concentrations were measured at 3, 6 and 9 h post awakening over two consecutive weekdays, together with measures of perceived stress. Participants (n = 106) were men and women not in work aged between 35-55 years, resident in socially disadvantaged districts from the same Scottish, UK, urban context as the earlier study. Results from linear regression analyses showed a significant and negative relationship between higher green space levels and stress levels, indicating living in areas with a higher percentage of green space is associated with lower stress, confirming the earlier study findings. This study further extends the findings by showing significant gender differences in stress patterns by levels of green space, with women in lower green space areas showing higher levels of stress. A significant interaction effect between gender and percentage green space on mean cortisol concentrations showed a positive effect of higher green space in relation to cortisol measures in women, but not in men. Higher levels of neighbourhood green space were associated with healthier mean cortisol levels in women whilst also attenuating higher cortisol levels in men. We conclude that higher levels of green space in residential neighbourhoods, for this deprived urban population of middle-aged men and women not in work, are linked with lower perceived stress and a steeper (healthier) diurnal cortisol decline. However, overall patterns and levels of cortisol secretion in men and women were differentially related to neighbourhood green space and warrant further investigation. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract = {The social ties between the residents of urban neighbourhoods are in decline due to changing work patterns, increased mobility and developments in communications. Neighbourhood open spaces, and green spaces in particular, provide opportunities for social interactions that may help the residents to establish recognition and develop relationships. This paper investigates the contribution of local parks to the development of social ties in inner-city neighbourhoods. Combining quantitative methods (questionnaire survey) with a qualitative approach (focus group discussions), the research was carried out in three inner-city neighbourhoods in Greater Manchester, UK, characterised by different levels of material deprivation and ethnic diversity. The social survey explored the associations between the respondents' visits to local parks and the number of friends and acquaintances they had. The findings suggest that local parks may support the development of social ties in inner-city areas. Associations were found between the quality of the parks, the character of visits, and the extent of social ties in the neighbourhood. The study concludes that for inner-city parks to realise their full potential in supporting social interactions and developing social ties, they need to be well-maintained and provide good recreational facilities. The development of social ties was also found to be considerably affected by the characteristics of the individuals and the neighbourhood. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Urban infrastructure systems responsible for the provision of energy, transportation, shelter, and communication to populations are important determinants of health and health equity. The term “smart city” has been used synonymously with other terms, such as “digital city”, “sustainable city”, and “information city”, even though definitional distinctions exist between terms. In this review, we use “smart cities” as a catch-all term to refer to an emerging concept in urban governance practice and scholarship that has been increasingly applied to achieve public health aims. The objective of this systematic review was to document and analyze the inclusion of equity considerations and dimensions (i.e., a measurement, analytical, or dialectical focus on systematic disparities in health between groups) in smart city interventions aimed to improve human health and well-being. Systematic searches were carried out in the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Psychological Information Database (PsycINFO), the PubMed database from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, Elsevier's database Scopus, and Web of Science, returning 3219 titles. Ultimately, 28 articles were retained, assessed, and coded for their inclusion of equity characteristics using the Cochrane PROGRESS-Plus tool (referring to (P) place of residence, (R) race, (O) occupation, (G) gender, (R) religion, (E) education, (S) socio-economic status (SES), and (S) social capital). The most frequently included equity considerations in smart city health interventions were place of residence, SES, social capital, and personal characteristics; conversely, occupation, gender or sex, religion, race, ethnicity, culture, language, and education characteristics were comparatively less featured in such interventions. Overall, it appears that most of intervention evaluations assessed in this review are still in the early testing phases, and thus did not include or feature robust evaluative designs or commercially available technologies.},

abstract = {The central focus of this paper is on the differentiation of basic urban trading services in middle income cities and its role in service provision for the poor. Most studies dedicated to service delivery to the poor emphasize the inequalities pertaining from a growing differentiation in provision and take up some of the arguments of the splintering urbanism thesis. The paper examines some of the main claims made in this debate through a case study of Cape Town (South Africa). It illustrates how differentiation is implemented through service levels and tariffs and suggests that it is a pragmatic way of accommodating social and spatial disparities in a highly polarized city, while making progressive steps in favour of the poor. The main argument is that, in Cape Town like in many middle income cities, urban diversity restricts the relevance of conventional social policies and the scope of local solidarity with regard to service delivery. The differentiation of provision is thus a strategy to bring the diversity within the public service, and hence to preserve an institutional and financial public capacity of delivering subsidized services to the poor. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

abstract = {This paper is an examination of the splintering urbanism argument of the relationship between neo-liberal reforms of infrastructure networks and urban cohesion. Based on an analysis of historical and contemporary processes of infrastructure provision (water, sewerage and power) in colonial/post-colonial Bombay/Mumbai, it questions the assumption of a "modern infrastructure ideal" in the context of developing cities. In Mumbai, the historical analysis reveals the contradictions between this ideal and a hierarchical society. From the outset, access to services (particularly water and sewerage) was highly distorted in favour of the elites, even though utilities networks contributed to urban integration through cross-subsidies within and across sectors, and through the setting up of municipal institutions. Second, ongoing sectoral reforms demonstrate contrasting trends as increased differentiation of services produces both positive - better adaptation to users' needs - and potentially negative - fragmenting - socio-spatial implications. Third, an understudied potential fragmenting threat also lies in the sectoral approach to reforms as it undermines the existing crosssector subsidies and prevents the articulation of utility reforms with other limiting factors, such as land and transport, which are the main constraints for expanding housing and mobility in the city. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

By the same token, in a context of spatially concentrated income-earning opportunities and other urban functions, as well as limited purchasing power, accessibility to adequate means of connectivity with the rest of the urban fabric can be a determining factor in overcoming conditions of poverty for residents in physically marginal areas.Within the framework of the splintering urbanism thesis, and using the case study of Soacha, a municipality adjacent to Bogot{\'{a}}, Colombia's capital city, we examine the apparent mismatch between the growth of low-income informal settlements in peripheral locations and the development of transport networks in the period 2000-2010. Our aim is to identify the effects on social and spatial marginalisation of an uneven provision of material infrastructures and services for mobility. We identify central elements in the structure of the networks of connectivity between Bogot{\'{a}} and Soacha, highlighting the main gaps that lead to a fragmented set of connections. We develop a set of criteria for planners and policy makers searching for a more informed analysis of transport supply and policy development practice for poor peripheral populations in similar regions and contexts.},

Design Automated double-blind randomised controlled trial with 6 months follow-up (2014-2015). Setting Smartphone-based. Participants 684 participants (daily smokers of cigarettes, 18 years old or over) recruited passively from app stores in the USA, Australia, UK and Singapore, and randomised to one of two sub-apps. Intervention(s) Behavioural, decision-aid, smartphone application. Main outcome(s) Continuous abstinence at 10 days, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months. Results Smokers who received the decision-aid app were more likely to be continuously abstinent at 1 month compared with the information-only app (28.5% vs 16.9%; relative risk (RR) 1.68; 95% CI 1.25 to 2.28). The effect was sustained at 3 months (23.8% vs 10.2%; RR 2.08; 95% CI 1.38 to 3.18) and 6 months (10.2% vs 4.8%; RR 2.02; 95% CI 1.08 to 3.81). Participants receiving the decision-aid app were also more likely to have made an informed choice (31.9% vs 19.6%) and have lower decisional conflict (19.5% vs 3.9%). Conclusion A smartphone decision-aid app with support features significantly increased smoking cessation and informed choice. With an increasing number of smokers attempting to quit, unassisted evidence-based decision-aid apps can provide an effective and user-friendly option to many who are making quit decisions without healthcare professionals.

abstract = {Objectives: To examine whether exposure to workplace stressors predicts changes in physical activity and the risk of insufficient physical activity. Methods: Prospective data from the Finnish Public Sector Study. Repeated exposure to low job control, high job demands, low effort, low rewards and compositions of these ( job strain and effort-reward imbalance) were assessed at Time 1 (2000-2002) and Time 2 (2004). Insufficient physical activity (<14 metabolic equivalent task hours per week) was measured at Time 1 and Time 3 (2008). The effect of change in workplace stressors on change in physical activity was examined using fixedeffects (within-subject) logistic regression models (N=6665). In addition, logistic regression analysis was applied to examine the associations between repeated exposure to workplace stressors and insufficient physical activity (N=13 976). In these analyses, coworker assessed workplace stressor scores were used in addition to individual level scores. Results: The proportion of participants with insufficient physical activity was 24% at baseline and 26% at follow-up. 19% of the participants who were sufficiently active at baseline became insufficiently active at followup. In the fixed-effect analysis, an increase in workplace stress was weakly related to an increase in physical inactivity within an individual. In between-subjects analysis, employees with repeated exposure to low job control and low rewards were more likely to be insufficiently active at follow-up than those with no reports of these stressors; fully adjusted ORs ranged from 1.11 (95% CI 1.00 to 1.24) to 1.21 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.39). Conclusions: Workplace stress is associated with a slightly increased risk of physical inactivity.},

abstract = {The research aim was to test the Job Demand-Control (JDC) Model demands × Control interaction (or buffering) hypothesis in a simulated bus driving experiment. The buffering hypothesis was tested using a 2 (low and high demands) × 2 (low and high decision latitude) design with repeated measures on the second factor. A sample of 80 bus operators were randomly assigned to the low (n = 40) and high demands (n = 40) conditions. Demands were manipulated by increasing or reducing the number of stops to pick up passengers, and decision latitude by imposing or removing restrictions on the Rapid Transit Bus (BRT) operators' pace of work. Outcome variables include physiological markers (heart rate [HR], heart rate variability [HRV], breathing rate [BR], electromyography [EMG], and skin conductance [SC]), objective driving performance and self-report measurements of psychological wellbeing (psychological distress, interest/enjoyment [I/E], perceived competence, effort/importance [E/I], and pressure/tension [P/T]). It was found that job decision latitude moderates the effect of job demands on both physiological arousal (BR: F(1, 74) = 4.680, p = .034, SC: F(1, 75) = 6.769, p = .011, and EMG: F(1, 75) = 6.550, p = .013) and psychological well-being (P/T: F(1, 75) = 4.289, p = .042 and I/E: F(1, 74) = 4.548, p = .036). Consistently with the JDC model buffering hypothesis, the experimental findings suggest that increasing job decision latitude can moderate the negative effect of job demands on different psychophysiological outcomes. This finding is useful for designing organizational and clinical interventions in an occupational group at high risk of work stress-related disease.},

Immigrant women (white and non-white) were more likely to rate their health as poor through this 12-year period than the Canadian born women (White-OR: 1.64, 95% CI: 1.17-2.64; Non-white-OR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.01-3.28). Immigrants in the lowest income adequacy category reported higher psychological distress and poorer health than those in the highest income categories. We did not find any significant differences in the mental health and self-rated health of Canadian men and white male immigrants throughout this 12-year period. Though, non-white immigrant women were less likely to have severe psychological distress through this 12 year period, they were the ones most likely to rate their health as poor. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.},

abstract = {There is a large and persistent association between education and health. In this paper, we review what is known about thislink.We first document the facts about the relationship between education and health. The education ‘gradient' isfound for both health behaviors and health status, though the former does not fully explain the latter. The effect of education increases with increasing years of education, with no evidence of a sheepskin effect. Nor are there differences between blacks and whites, or men and women. Gradients in behavior are biggest at young ages, and decline after age 50 or 60. We then consider differing reasons why education might be related to health. The obvious economic explanations – education isrelated to income or occupational choice – explain only a part of the education effect. We suggest that increasing levels of education lead to different thinking and decision-making patterns.Themonetaryvalue ofthe return to education in terms of health is perhaps half of the return to education on earnings,so policiesthat impact educational attainment could have a large effect on population health.},

abstract = {Background: Advanced lung cancer patients often have chronic lung disease with reduced exercise capacities and various symptoms leading to altered quality of life (QoL). No studies have assessed pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) employing a mobile app and an Internet of Things device in advanced lung cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Objective: This study aimed to determine the feasibility and efficacy of smartphone app-based PR on exercise capacity, symptom management, and QoL in patients with advanced lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Methods: A total of 100 patients were recruited in a prospective, single-arm intervention study using a smartphone app-based PR program for 12 weeks. Exercise capacity (6-min walking distance, 6MWD), QoL, symptom scale scores, and distress indexes were investigated. Results: A total of 90 patients completed the PR program. The most common cause of drop out was hospitalization because of cancer progression. After PR, there was significant improvement in the 6MWD; 380.1 m (SD 74.1) at baseline, 429.1 m (SD 58.6) at 6 weeks (P <.001), and 448.1 m (SD 50.0) at 12 weeks (P <.001). However, the dyspnea scale score showed no significant improvement in the patients overall, but there was a trend for improvement in those with a stable tumor response (P=.07). Role (P=.02), emotional (P <.001), and social functioning (P=.002) scale scores showed significant improvement after PR. Symptom scale scores for fatigue (P <.001), anorexia (P=.047), and diarrhea (P=.01) also showed significant improvement. There was significant improvement in depression (P=.048) and anxiety (P=.01), whereas there was no significant change in QoL (P=.06) and severity of pain (P=.24). Conclusions: Smartphone app-based PR represents an effective and feasible program to improve exercise capacity and to manage symptoms and distress in patients with advanced lung cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy.},

abstract = {Background: EDUCERE ("Ubiquitous Detection Ecosystem to Care and Early Stimulation for Children with Developmental Disorders") is an ecosystem for ubiquitous detection, care, and early stimulation of children with developmental disorders. The objectives of this Spanish government-funded research and development project are to investigate, develop, and evaluate innovative solutions to detect changes in psychomotor development through the natural interaction of children with toys and everyday objects, and perform stimulation and early attention activities in real environments such as home and school. Thirty multidisciplinary professionals and three nursery schools worked in the EDUCERE project between 2014 and 2017 and they obtained satisfactory results. Related to EDUCERE, we found studies based on providing networks of connected smart objects and the interaction between toys and social networks. Objective: This research includes the design, implementation, and validation of an EDUCERE smart toy aimed to automatically detect delays in psychomotor development. The results from initial tests led to enhancing the effectiveness of the original design and deployment. The smart toy, based on stackable cubes, has a data collector module and a smart system for detection of developmental delays, called the EDUCERE developmental delay screening system (DDSS). Methods: The pilot study involved 65 toddlers aged between 23 and 37 months (mean=29.02, SD 3.81) who built a tower with five stackable cubes, designed by following the EDUCERE smart toy model. As toddlers made the tower, sensors in the cubes sent data to a collector module through a wireless connection. All trials were video-recorded for further analysis by child development experts. After watching the videos, experts scored the performance of the trials to compare and fine-Tune the interpretation of the data automatically gathered by the toy-embedded sensors. Results: Judges were highly reliable in an interrater agreement analysis (intraclass correlation 0.961, 95% CI 0.937-0.967), suggesting that the process was successful to separate different levels of performance. A factor analysis of collected data showed that three factors, trembling, speed, and accuracy, accounted for 76.79% of the total variance, but only two of them were predictors of performance in a regression analysis: Accuracy (P=.001) and speed (P=.002). The other factor, trembling (P=.79), did not have a significant effect on this dependent variable. Conclusions: The EDUCERE DDSS is ready to use the regression equation obtained for the dependent variable "performance" as an algorithm for the automatic detection of psychomotor developmental delays. The results of the factor analysis are valuable to simplify the design of the smart toy by taking into account only the significant variables in the collector module. The fine-Tuning of the toy process module will be carried out by following the specifications resulting from the analysis of the data to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the product.},

abstract = {Background: Recognizing and appropriately treating mental health problems among new immigrants and refugees in primary care poses a challenge because of differences in language and culture and because of specific stressors associated with migration and resettlement. We aimed to identify risk factors and strategies in the approach to mental health assessment and to prevention and treatment of common mental health problems for immigrants in primary care. Methods: We searched and compiled literature on prevalence and risk factors for common mental health problems related to migration, the effect of cultural influences on health and illness, and clinical strategies to improve mental health care for immigrants and refugees. Publications were selected on the basis of relevance, use of recent data and quality in consultation with experts in immigrant and refugee mental health. Results: The migration trajectory can be divided into three components: premigration, migration and postmigration resettlement. Each phase is associated with specific risks and exposures. The prevalence of specific types of mental health problems is influenced by the nature of the migration experience, in terms of adversity experienced before, during and after resettlement. Specific challenges in migrant mental health include communication difficulties because of language and cultural differences; the effect of cultural shaping of symptoms and illness behaviour on diagnosis, coping and treatment; differences in family structure and process affecting adaptation, acculturation and intergenerational conflict; and aspects of acceptance by the receiving society that affect employment, social status and integration. These issues can be addressed through specific inquiry, the use of trained interpreters and culture brokers, meetings with families, and consultation with community organizations. Interpretation: Systematic inquiry into patients' migration trajectory and subsequent follow-up on culturally appropriate indicators of social, vocational and family functioning over time will allow clinicians to recognize problems in adaptation and undertake mental health promotion, disease prevention or treatment interventions in a timely way. {\textcopyright} 2011 Canadian Medical Association or its licensors.},

abstract = {Smart homes for the aging population have recently started attracting the attention of the research community. The “health state” of smart homes is comprised of many different levels; starting with the physical health of citizens, it also includes longer-term health norms and outcomes, as well as the arena of positive behavior changes. One of the problems of interest is to monitor the activities of daily living (ADL) of the elderly, aiming at their protection and well-being. For this purpose, we installed passive infrared (PIR) sensors to detect motion in a specific area inside a smart apartment and used them to collect a set of ADL. In a novel approach, we describe a technology that allows the ground truth collected in one smart home to train activity recognition systems for other smart homes. We asked the users to label all instances of all ADL only once and subsequently applied data mining techniques to cluster in-home sensor firings. Each cluster would therefore represent the instances of the same activity. Once the clusters were associated to their corresponding activities, our system was able to recognize future activities. To improve the activity recognition accuracy, our system preprocessed raw sensor data by identifying overlapping activities. To evaluate the recognition performance from a 200-day dataset, we implemented three different active learning classification algorithms and compared their performance: naive Bayesian (NB), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). Based on our results, the RF classifier recognized activities with an average specificity of 96.53%, a sensitivity of 68.49%, a precision of 74.41% and an F-measure of 71.33%, outperforming both the NB and SVM classifiers. Further clustering markedly improved the results of the RF classifier. An activity recognition system based on PIR sensors in conjunction with a clustering classification approach was able to detect ADL from datasets collected from different homes. Thus, our PIR-based smart home technology could improve care and provide valuable information to better understand the functioning of our societies, as well as to inform both individual and collective action in a smart city scenario.},

abstract = {Autism is a complex developmental disorder that affects approximately 1 in 68 children (according to the recent survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—CDC) in the U.S., and has become the fastest growing category of special education. Each student with autism comes with her or his own unique needs and an array of behaviors and habits that can be severe and which interfere with everyday tasks. Autism is associated with intellectual disability, impairments in social skills, and physical health issues such as sleep and abdominal disturbances. We have designed an Internet-of-Things (IoT) framework named WearSense that leverages the sensing capabilities of modern smartwatches to detect stereotypic behaviors in children with autism. In this work, we present a study that used the inbuilt accelerometer of a smartwatch to detect three behaviors, including hand flapping, painting, and sibbing that are commonly observed in children with autism. In this feasibility study, we recruited 14 subjects to record the accelerometer data from the smartwatch worn on the wrist. The processing part extracts 34 different features in each dimension of the three-axis accelerometer, resulting in 102 features. Using and comparing various classification techniques revealed that an ensemble of 40 decision trees has the best accuracy of around 94.6%. This accuracy shows the quality of the data collected from the smartwatch and feature extraction methods used in this study. The recognition of these behaviors by using a smartwatch would be helpful in monitoring individuals with autistic behaviors, since the smartwatch can send the data to the cloud for comprehensive analysis and also to help parents, caregivers, and clinicians make informed decisions.},

BeWell promotes improved behavioral patterns via feedback rendered as an ambient display on the smartphone's wallpaper. With BeWell+, we introduce new mechanisms to address key limitations of the original BeWell app; specifically, (1) community adaptive wellbeing feedback, which generalizes to diverse user communities (e.g.; elderly, children) by promoting better behavior yet remains realistic to the user's lifestyle; and, (2) wellbeing adaptive energy allocation, which prioritizes monitoring fidelity and feedback responsiveness on specific health dimensions (e.g.; sleep) where the user needs additional help. We evaluate BeWell+ with a 27 person, 19 day field trial. Our findings show that not only can BeWell+ operate successfully on consumer smartphones; but also users understand feedback and respond by taking steps towards leading healthier lifestyles. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {The emergence of ubiquitous sensing and the Internet of Things (IoT) have inspired the development of 'smart' everyday objects, which offer tremendous opportunities for maintaining the quality of life in ambient assisted living (AAL) environments. Inspired by the future possibilities of connected everyday devices, we envision a peripheral activity-based awareness system that captures human activity information and renders this information to enhance context awareness and support social connectedness between the elderly and their caregivers. Leveraging ambient intelligence and IoT technologies, ambient displays can convey activity information in the periphery of our attention. In particular, light has been used as a means to display ambient information and there is scientific evidence that it can enhance well-being, interconnectedness, and improve productivity. In this paper, we undertake two studies, first through an exploratory study we investigate the features of light suitable for conveying subtle activity information within the periphery of the users' attention for promoting context awareness. Also, we examine the preferences, perceptions, and interpretations of ambient lighting configurations of prospective caregiver's for conveying the activity information of older adults. In a second study, we assess the implications of activity awareness through lighting on cognitive performance, moods, and social connectedness. The set-up and design decisions of the second study were partly informed by previous research and by the outcomes of the first experiment. Together, these studies provide additional design guidelines for representing activity information with ambient lighting and highlight potential benefits and usage possibilities for lighting displays within the AAL domain. Furthermore, the results indicate a significant effect of activity awareness on cognitive performance. However, there were no significant effects of activity awareness through lighting on moods and social connectedness. Finally, we discuss the design guidelines and implications of these findings for designing activity-based ambient lighting displays for AAL environments.},

abstract = {Background: Physical activity helps people maintain a healthy weight and reduces the risk for several chronic diseases. Although this knowledge is widely recognized, adults and children in many countries around the world do not get recommended amounts of physical activity. Although many interventions are found to be ineffective at increasing physical activity or reaching inactive populations, there have been anecdotal reports of increased physical activity due to novel mobile games that embed game play in the physical world. The most recent and salient example of such a game is Pok{\'{e}}mon Go, which has reportedly reached tens of millions of users in the United States and worldwide. Objective: The objective of this study was to quantify the impact of Pok{\'{e}}mon Go on physical activity. Methods: We study the effect of Pok{\'{e}}mon Go on physical activity through a combination of signals from large-scale corpora of wearable sensor data and search engine logs for 32,000 Microsoft Band users over a period of 3 months. Pok{\'{e}}mon Go players are identified through search engine queries and physical activity is measured through accelerometers. Results: We find that Pok{\'{e}}mon Go leads to significant increases in physical activity over a period of 30 days, with particularly engaged users (ie, those making multiple search queries for details about game usage) increasing their activity by 1473 steps a day on average, a more than 25% increase compared with their prior activity level (P<.001). In the short time span of the study, we estimate that Pok{\'{e}}mon Go has added a total of 144 billion steps to US physical activity. Furthermore, Pok{\'{e}}mon Go has been able to increase physical activity across men and women of all ages, weight status, and prior activity levels showing this form of game leads to increases in physical activity with significant implications for public health. In particular, we find that Pok{\'{e}}mon Go is able to reach low activity populations, whereas all 4 leading mobile health apps studied in this work largely draw from an already very active population. Conclusions: Mobile apps combining game play with physical activity lead to substantial short-term activity increases and, in contrast to many existing interventions and mobile health apps, have the potential to reach activity-poor populations. Future studies are needed to investigate potential long-term effects of these applications.},

abstract = {The main aim was to analyse the effect of 8 weeks of Pok{\'{e}}mon GO on cognitive performance (memory, selective attention, concentration, mathematical calculation and linguistic reasoning) and emotional intelligence (well-being, self-control, emotionality and sociability) in Spanish adolescents between 12 and 15 years. A longitudinal design was used, with a Control Group (n = 103) that did not use Pok{\'{e}}mon GO, and Experimental Group (n = 87) that used Pok{\'{e}}mon GO during 8 weeks. Age, sex, BMI, maternal educational level, number of computers at home and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were used as confounders. Results showed that players walked 54 km and spent 40 min/day playing in this period. Boys played more, won more points and reached a higher level in the game than girls. The players playing Pok{\'{e}}mon GO significantly increased their selective attention (p = 0.003), concentration levels (p < 0.001), and sociability levels (p = 0.003) against their peers. It is concluded that Pok{\'{e}}mon GO increases, in a playful way, the amount of daily exercise in adolescents, could positively affect their cognitive performance, and improve the social relationships. Further studies are required to perform comparisons between single and collaborative play and to identify the pedagogical benefits through some subjects such as Physical Education.},

abstract = {A challenge associated with an ageing population is increased demand on health and social care, creating a greater need to enable persons to live independently in their own homes. Ambient assistant living technology aims to address this by monitoring occupants' ‘activities of daily living' using smart home sensors to alert caregivers to abnormalities in routine tasks and deteriorations in a person's ability to care for themselves. However, there has been less focus on using sensing technology to monitor a broader scope of so-called ‘meaningful activities', which promote a person's emotional, creative, intellectual, and spiritual needs. In this paper, we describe the development of a toolkit comprised of off-the-shelf, affordable sensors to allow persons with dementia and Parkinson's disease to monitor meaningful activities as well as activities of daily living in order to self-manage their life and well-being. We describe two evaluations of the toolkit, firstly a lab-based study to test the installation of the system including the acuity and placement of sensors and secondly, an in-the-wild study where subjects who were not target users of the toolkit, but who identified as technology enthusiasts evaluated the feasibility of the toolkit to monitor activities in and around real homes. Subjects from the in-the-wild study reported minimal obstructions to installation and were able to carry out and enjoy activities without obstruction from the sensors, revealing that meaningful activities may be monitored remotely using affordable, passive sensors. We propose that our toolkit may enhance assistive living systems by monitoring a wider range of activities than activities of daily living.},

abstract = {Elderly care is a pressing societal challenge: Government's financial burden is expected to exponentially increase in the next 20 years as the population is aging rapidly. Solutions to mitigate this challenge include the use of IoT and software solutions to minimise the effort of elderly care, in care centres and at home. To accomplish this, we set to quantify what are the most important elderly care metrics (i.e., what is important to support caregivers' work) through field observations and interviews at a local care centre housing 14 old adults. We designed iteratively and evaluated the usefulness of a mobile application with 8 caregivers, to summarise and communicate the care metrics, juxtaposed with wellbeing data (e.g., social interaction, mobility and others), part of a larger elderly care support platform, CARE. The goal of the mobile application is to enable a better care service by raising awareness to daily needs and routines of the elderly and to provide quick access to their wellbeing information. Our findings advocate that our design could positively benefit the care personnel and assist them carrying out the daily duties at the care centre.},

The in-car environment incorporates a basic state that uses color to relax or energize the driver, and an exploratory state that intends to immerse the user into a simulated environment. In the exploratory state, the user plays with a tangible input device allowing the simulated environment to appear. This environment includes images and sounds related to a certain theme. Our preliminary research findings reveal that users felt significantly calmer and marginally significantly better after interacting with the simulated environment. Results from the semi-structured interviews demonstrated that the majority of people appreciated the system and thought it might be effective to support unwinding. These outcomes demonstrate potential in the concept, but testing in a more realistic setting is necessary. {\textcopyright} 2013 ACM.},

To explore how to implement exercises into the car context, we designed AutoGym, an in-car fitness program that translates frustrating traffic into a fun exertion game. To progress in the game, the players must anticipate changes to the traffic situation they are exposed to in the car and work-out against their prediction. In this paper, we present the conceptual design of AutoGym and report what we have learnt from an explorative user study with 28 participants. Furthermore, from the design process and the evaluation, we derived three strategies for implementing exertion games. We found that these strategies helped to conceptualize exertion games as a playful embodiment of the dynamics of driving and as such, can positively influence the experience of control, orientation and situational awareness i.e. experiential factors that can be crucial for facilitating future autonomous driving in a pleasurable and safe way.},

Methods: A systematic literature search for studies with the primary aim of TPB-based questionnaire development was conducted in relevant databases between 2002 and 2012 using selected search terms. Ten of 1,034 screened abstracts met the inclusion criteria and were assessed for methodological quality using two different appraisal tools: one for the overall methodological quality of each study and the other developed for the appraisal of the questionnaire content and development process. Both appraisal tools consisted of items regarding the likelihood of bias in each study and were eventually combined to give the overall quality score for each included study. Results: 8 of the 10 included studies showed low risk of bias in the overall quality assessment of each study, while 9 of the studies were of high quality based on the quality appraisal of questionnaire content and development process. Conclusion: Quality appraisal of the questionnaires in the 10 reviewed studies was successfully conducted, highlighting the top problem areas (including: sample size estimation; inclusion of direct and indirect measures; and inclusion of questions on demographics) in the development of TPB-based questionnaires and the need for researchers to provide a more detailed account of their development process. {\textcopyright} 2014 Oluka et al.},

Asthma can significantly impact a patient's quality of life. Asthma action plans are said to be one of the most effective asthma interventions available. However, in Australia only one in five people aged 15 and over, with asthma, have a written asthma action plan. Even less of which, refer to their plan. A review of related literature and work showed a gap regarding accessibility of information on asthma action plans in a written form. In an attempt to mitigate this problem, this paper focuses on the design and development of a smartphone application. The application is currently a high-fidelity prototype designed and built using proto.io.software. In addition to this conversion, the application incorporates aspects of the Internet of Things (IoT) whereby realtime data regarding environmental triggers such as temperature, humidity and pollen in surroundings, can be accessed from the application. The application ultimately aims to help asthmatics improve their health and quality of life by providing them, or their carer with the knowledge needed to better understand and manage their asthma, when and where they need it.},

There is limited evidence that green or natural environments are positive for physical and mental health and wellbeing. We present a new and unique primary research study exploring the relationship between momentary subjective wellbeing (SWB) and individuals' immediate environment within the UK. We developed and applied an innovative data collection tool: a smartphone app that signals participants at random moments, presenting a brief questionnaire while using satellite positioning (GPS) to determine geographical coordinates. We used this to collect over one million responses from more than 20,000 participants. Associating GPS response locations with objective spatial data, we estimate a model relating land cover to SWB using only the within-individual variation, while controlling for weather, daylight, activity, companionship, location type, time, day, and any response trend. On average, study participants are significantly and substantially happier outdoors in all green or natural habitat types than they are in urban environments. These findings are robust to a number of alternative models and model specifications. This study provides a new line of evidence on links between nature and wellbeing, strengthening existing evidence of a positive relationship between SWB and exposure to green or natural environments in daily life. Our results have informed the UK National Ecosystem Assessment (NEA), and the novel geo-located experience sampling methodology we describe has great potential to provide new insights in a range of areas of interest to policymakers. {\textcopyright} 2013 .},

abstract = {Objective To assess the effectiveness of mHealth interventions for maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH) in low- and middle- income countries (LMIC). Methods 16 online international databases were searched to identify studies evaluating the impact of mHealth interventions on MNCH outcomes in LMIC, between January 1990 and May 2014. Comparable studies were included in a random-effects meta-analysis. Findings Of 8593 unique references screened after de-duplication, 15 research articles and two conference abstracts met inclusion criteria, including 12 intervention and three observational studies. Only two studies were graded at low risk of bias. Only one study demonstrated an improvement in morbidity or mortality, specifically decreased risk of perinatal death in children of mothers who received SMS support during pregnancy, compared with routine prenatal care. Meta-analysis of three studies on infant feeding showed that prenatal interventions using SMS/cell phone (vs routine care) improved rates of breastfeeding (BF) within one hour after birth (odds ratio (OR) 2.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27-2.75, I2 = 80.9%) and exclusive BF for three/four months (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.26-2.50, I2 = 52.8%) and for six months (OR 2.57, 95% CI 1.46-3.68, I2 = 0.0%). Included studies encompassed interventions designed for health information delivery (n = 6); reminders (n = 3); communication (n = 2); data collection (n = 2); test result turnaround (n = 2); peer group support (n = 2) and psychological intervention (n = 1). Conclusions Most studies of mHealth for MNCH in LMIC are of poor methodological quality and few have evaluated impacts on patient outcomes. Improvements in intermediate outcomes have nevertheless been reported in many studies and there is modest evidence that interventions delivered via SMS messaging can improve infant feeding. Ambiguous descriptions of interventions and their mechanisms of impact present difficulties for interpretation and replication.

We developed a smartphone-based tool (Urban Mind; www.urbanmind.info) to examine how exposure to natural features within the built environment affects mental well-being in real time. The tool was used to monitor 108 individuals who completed 3013 assessments over a 1-week period. Significant immediate and lagged associations with mental well-being were found for several natural features. These associations were stronger in people with higher trait impulsivity, a psychological measure of one's tendency to behave with little forethought or consideration of the consequences, which is indicative of a higher risk of developing mental-health issues. Our investigation suggests that the benefits of nature on mental well-being are time-lasting and interact with an individual's vulnerability to mental illness.

abstract = {Study objective: To propose a definition of health equity to guide operationalisation and measurement, and to discuss the practical importance of clarity in defining this concept. Design: Conceptual discussion. Setting, Patients/Participants, and Main results: not applicable. Conclusions: For the purposes of measurement and operationalisation, equity in health is the absence of systematic disparities in health (or in the major social determinants of health) between groups with different levels of underlying social advantage/disadvantoge - that is, wealth, power, or prestige. Inequities in health systematically put groups of people who are already socially disadvantaged (for example, by virtue of being poor, female, and/or members of a disenfranchised racial, ethnic, or religious group) at further disadvantage with respect to their health; health is essential to wellbeing and to overcoming other effects of social disadvantage. Equity is an ethical principle; it also is consonant with and closely related to human rights principles. The proposed definition of equity supports operationalisation of the right to the highest attainable standard of health as indicated by the health status of the most socially advantaged group. Assessing health equity requires comparing health and its social determinants between more and less advantaged social groups. These comparisons are essential to assess whether national and international policies are leading toward or away from greater social justice in health.},

abstract = {Intelligent communities and cities (IC) belong to an emerging movement targeting the creation of environments that improve cognitive skills and abilities to learn and innovate. They represent environments that enable superior cognitive capabilities and creativity to be collectively constructed from combinations of individual cognitive skills and information systems that operate in the physical, institutional, and digital spaces of cities. Two academic traditions have been feeding the discussion concerning intelligent communities and cities: the literature on innovative environments and the planning of digital cities. Following an introduction on the meaning of ICs, we discuss the structuring of innovative environments such as clusters, technology districts and territorial systems of innovation, which rely on different architectures of knowledge networks enhancing product, process, and organizational innovation. Then we turn to digital cities and examine their concept, architecture, and constituent elements. In the final section of the paper we describe intelligent cities as overlapping of innovative clusters and digital cities. Intelligent cities integrate knowledge-intensive activities and clusters; embedded routines of social cooperation enabling knowledge sharing and innovation; advanced communication infrastructure and digital spaces for knowledge and innovation management; and proven ability to innovate and resolve problems that appear for the first time, since the capacity to innovate and manage uncertainty are critical factors in characterizing intelligence.},

abstract = {In this paper I discuss the digital city as a comprehensive, web-based representation, or reproduction, of several aspects or functions of a specific real city, open to nonexperts. Much more than a technical and practical issue, the digital city has dimensions that are social, cultural, political, ideological, and of course also theoretical. I explore these broader conceptual underpinnings of the digital city idea. More specifically: where do urban ideologies, urban structures and functions, and digital urban representations meet? How may the digital city relate to the real city? On the basis of what choices might the digital city be constructed? What might the digital city mean to people? To be answered, these highly involved and interrelated questions require a coherent conceptual framework. By considering an overview of digital-city realizations, issues, and critiques, I adumbrate a theory of the digital city, seen as lying at the intersection of three domains: a physical urban area, the communities of people associated with that area, and the possibilities and constraints (technological, but also socioeconomic and ideological) of the evolving information society. A rough sketch is all that can be offered at this point because proper theories of the digital city cannot be developed independently of comprehensive theories of the real 21st-century city. I close with a brief discussion of what these ideas might imply for digital-city designers.},

abstract = {Background: Measuring disease and injury burden in populations requires a composite metric that captures both premature mortality and the prevalence and severity of ill-health. The 1990 Global Burden of Disease study proposed disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to measure disease burden. No comprehensive update of disease burden worldwide incorporating a systematic reassessment of disease and injury-specific epidemiology has been done since the 1990 study. We aimed to calculate disease burden worldwide and for 21 regions for 1990, 2005, and 2010 with methods to enable meaningful comparisons over time. Methods: We calculated DALYs as the sum of years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs). DALYs were calculated for 291 causes, 20 age groups, both sexes, and for 187 countries, and aggregated to regional and global estimates of disease burden for three points in time with strictly comparable definitions and methods. YLLs were calculated from age-sex-country-time-specific estimates of mortality by cause, with death by standardised lost life expectancy at each age. YLDs were calculated as prevalence of 1160 disabling sequelae, by age, sex, and cause, and weighted by new disability weights for each health state. Neither YLLs nor YLDs were age-weighted or discounted. Uncertainty around cause-specific DALYs was calculated incorporating uncertainty in levels of all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, prevalence, and disability weights. Findings: Global DALYs remained stable from 1990 (2{\textperiodcentered}503 billion) to 2010 (2{\textperiodcentered}490 billion). Crude DALYs per 1000 decreased by 23% (472 per 1000 to 361 per 1000). An important shift has occurred in DALY composition with the contribution of deaths and disability among children (younger than 5 years of age) declining from 41% of global DALYs in 1990 to 25% in 2010. YLLs typically account for about half of disease burden in more developed regions (high-income Asia Pacific, western Europe, high-income North America, and Australasia), rising to over 80% of DALYs in sub-Saharan Africa. In 1990, 47% of DALYs worldwide were from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders, 43% from non-communicable diseases, and 10% from injuries. By 2010, this had shifted to 35%, 54%, and 11%, respectively. Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of DALYs worldwide in 2010 (up from fourth rank in 1990, increasing by 29%), followed by lower respiratory infections (top rank in 1990; 44% decline in DALYs), stroke (fifth in 1990; 19% increase), diarrhoeal diseases (second in 1990; 51% decrease), and HIV/AIDS (33rd in 1990; 351% increase). Major depressive disorder increased from 15th to 11th rank (37% increase) and road injury from 12th to 10th rank (34% increase). Substantial heterogeneity exists in rankings of leading causes of disease burden among regions. Interpretation: Global disease burden has continued to shift away from communicable to non-communicable diseases and from premature death to years lived with disability. In sub-Saharan Africa, however, many communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders remain the dominant causes of disease burden. The rising burden from mental and behavioural disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, and diabetes will impose new challenges on health systems. Regional heterogeneity highlights the importance of understanding local burden of disease and setting goals and targets for the post-2015 agenda taking such patterns into account. Because of improved definitions, methods, and data, these results for 1990 and 2010 supersede all previously published Global Burden of Disease results.},

abstract = {Objectives To assess the utility of an acronym, place of residence, race/ethnicity/culture/language, occupation, gender/sex, religion, education, socioeconomic status, and social capital ("PROGRESS"), in identifying factors that stratify health opportunities and outcomes. We explored the value of PROGRESS as an equity lens to assess effects of interventions on health equity. Study Design and Setting We assessed the utility of PROGRESS by using it in 11 systematic reviews and methodological studies published between 2008 and 2013. To develop the justification for each of the PROGRESS elements, we consulted experts to identify examples of unfair differences in disease burden and an intervention that can effectively address these health inequities. Results Each PROGRESS factor can be justified on the basis of unfair differences in disease burden and the potential for interventions to reduce these differential effects. We have not provided a rationale for why the difference exists but have attempted to explain why these differences may contribute to disadvantage and argue for their consideration in new evaluations, systematic reviews, and intervention implementation. Conclusion The acronym PROGRESS is a framework and aide-memoire that is useful in ensuring that an equity lens is applied in the conduct, reporting, and use of research. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The concept of Smart City embraces several definitions depending on the meanings of the word “smart”: intelligent city, knowledge city, ubiquitous city, sustainable city, digital city, etc. Many definitions of Smart City exist, but no one has been universally acknowledged yet. From literature analysis it emerges that Smart City and Digital City are the most used terminologies in literature to indicate the smartness of a city. This Chapter explores the literature about Smart City and Digital City from 1993 to the end of 2012 in order to investigate how these two concepts were born, how they have developed, which are the shared features and differences between them. To accomplish with these goals, three steps were followed: (1) to set up a search strategy for systematic literature review to collect a representative subset of papers about Smart City and Digital City using Google Scholar; (2) to store the selected subset in an ad-doc database to synthesize the literature review; (3) to organize the literature review subset to extract quantitative and qualitative data and information about Smart City and Digital City evolution. The author proposes a literature review taxonomy through five specific analysis: (1) time analysis, to explore the causes of the trend of Smart City and Digital City literature in the latest twenty years; (2) terminology analysis, to examine how and where these two ideas were born and what have been the main events influenced their development; (3) definitions analysis, to select and compare the most cited and validated definitions of Smart City and Digital City trying to identify similarities, differences or overlaps between these two concepts; (4) typology analysis, to investigate if Smart City and Digital City are included into a specific urban strategy pursued by government or if they face specific urban problems without a comprehensive framework; (5) geographic analysis, to understand where are the largest concentrations of Smart Cities and Digital Cities in the world and which are their main characteristics and best practices.},

abstract = {This communication explores the unique challenge of contemporary urban problems and the technologies that vendors have to solve them. An acknowledged gap exists between widely referenced technologies that city managers utilize to optimize scheduled operations and those that reflect the capability of spontaneity in search of nuance-laden solutions to problems related to the reflexivity of entire systems. With regulation, the first issue type succumbs to rehearsed preparation whereas the second hinges on extemporaneous practice. One is susceptible to ready-made technology applications while the other requires systemic deconstruction and solution-seeking redesign. Research suggests that smart city vendors are expertly configured to address the former, but less adept at and even ill-configured to react to and address the latter. Departures from status quo responses to systemic problems depend on formalizing metrics that enable city monitoring and data collection to assess "smart investments", regardless of the size of the intervention, and to anticipate the need for designs that preserve the individuality of urban settings as they undergo the transformation to become "smart"..},

However, what ‘citizen-centric' means in practice is rarely articulated. We draw on and extend Sherry Arnstein's seminal work on participation in planning and renewal programmes to create the ‘Scaffold of Smart Citizen Participation'—a conceptual tool to unpack the diverse ways in which the smart city frames citizens. We use this scaffold to measure smart citizen inclusion, participation, and empowerment in smart city initiatives in Dublin, Ireland. Our analysis illustrates how most ‘citizen-centric' smart city initiatives are rooted in stewardship, civic paternalism, and a neoliberal conception of citizenship that prioritizes consumption choice and individual autonomy within a framework of state and corporate defined constraints that prioritize market-led solutions to urban issues, rather than being grounded in civil, social and political rights and the common good. We conclude that significant normative work is required to rethink ‘smart citizens' and ‘smart citizenship' and to remake smart cities if they are to truly become ‘citizen-centric'.},

A meta-analysis to test intervention efficacy was performed, and subgroup analyses were conducted to determine whether interventions' delivery mode(s), inclusion of personal contact, duration and interaction frequency improve efficacy. Pooled body weight reduction (d = −0.23; 95% confidence interval = −0.38, −0.08) was significant. Interventions delivered via other modes in addition to the mobile phone were associated with weight reduction. Personal contact and more frequent interactions in interventions were also associated with greater weight reduction. In conclusion, the current body of evidence shows that interventions delivered via mobile phones produce a modest reduction in body weight when combined with other delivery modes.

Yet despite numerous examples of this 'urban labelling' phenomenon, we know surprisingly little about so-called smart cities, particularly in terms of what the label ideologically reveals as well as hides. Due to its lack of definitional precision, not to mention an underlying self-congratulatory tendency, the main thrust of this article is to provide a preliminary critical polemic against some of the more rhetorical aspects of smart cities. The primary focus is on the labelling process adopted by some designated smart cities, with a view to problematizing a range of elements that supposedly characterize this new urban form, as well as question some of the underlying assumptions/ contradictions hidden within the concept. To aid this critique, the article explores to what extent labelled smart cities can be understood as a high-tech variation of the 'entrepreneurial city', as well as speculates on some general principles which would make them more progressive and inclusive.},

It then evaluates the results of Japanese government efforts in the promotion of ICT solutions for its older population against the availability of special infrastructure, device interfaces, and services and applications that meet five essential needs of the elderly with regard to quality of life in highly developed countries. Results and conclusion: The results of the study suggest that more efforts are needed to exploit ICT to transform all domains of society in order to meet the challenges produced by a rapidly ageing population. For that purpose the paper proposes 12 main areas in which to facilitate ICT innovations for an ageing population.

abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the literature on the types, effects, conditions and user of Open Government Data (OGD). The review analyses 101 academic studies about OGD which discuss at least one of the four factors of OGD utilization: the different types of utilization, the effects of utilization, the key conditions, and the different users. Our analysis shows that the majority of studies focus on the OGD provisions while assuming, but not empirically testing, various forms of utilization. The paper synthesizes the hypothesized relations in a multi-dimensional framework of OGD utilization. Based on the framework we suggest four future directions for research: 1) investigate the link between type of utilization and type of users (e.g. journalists, citizens) 2) investigate the link between type of user and type of effect (e.g. societal, economic and good governance benefits) 3) investigate the conditions that moderate OGD effects (e.g. policy, data quality) and 4) establishing a causal link between utilization and OGD outcomes.},

Splintering Urbanism. Networked Infractructures, Technoloical Moblilities and the Urban condition. Routledge, London]. Whilst acknowledging the value of the thesis as an analytical framework in opening the way to innovative understandings of contemporary urban dynamics, the paper argues that, taken together, the articles in this themed issue seriously challenge the "splintering urbanism" thesis theoretically, empirically and methodologically. They question in particular the postulated universality of the "modern infrastructural ideal" and of "unbundling" and "bypass" processes - all of which are key elements in Graham and Marvin's argument - as well as the assertion that reforms in infrastructure sectors should generally result in more discriminatory, socially regressive patterns of provision of essential services and more splintered urban spaces. Based on these fundamental critiques, the paper concludes that one cannot speak of "splintering urbanism in general" - i.e., as a global trend - in any meaningful analytical way. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The idea of the ‘smart city' is increasingly central to debates on urban development and sustainability, and a host of cities are now pursuing ‘smartness' as a way to improve energy efficiency, transport, and public services. However, existing research does not provide a clear picture of how this smart city agenda actually contributes to sustainability. The social science literature has been critical toward urban smartness, with most of the empirical research focusing on the politics of data-driven and entrepreneurial urbanism. This article seeks to contribute to this debate by empirically examining the role that sustainability plays in the smart city discourse. Its distinctive approach is to investigate how urban smartness and sustainability are framed by an authoritative institution (the European Union) and then to trace these framings down to a particular city (Stavanger, Norway). The data show that the smartness approach is strongly tied to innovation, technology, and economic entrepreneurialism, and sustainability does not appear to be a very important motivating driver. Nevertheless, the ‘sustainability component' of the smart city agenda becomes clearer the closer we come to the city level.},

abstract = {Climate change and advances in urban technology propel forward the 'smart city'. As decision makers strive to find a technological fix, smart city strategies are often based on technological orthodoxies which are conceptually and empirically shallow. The motivation behind this paper is to address the conceptual adolescence which relates to the wholesale digitisation of the city by pursuing a twin argument about the democratic and environmental consequences. The authors draw on interdisciplinary theory and insights from urban studies, infrastructure, informatics, and the sociology of the Internet to critique the way the 'smart city' is taken forward. It is concluded that private firms market smart city services and solutions based on an ideological legacy of 'ubiquitous computing', 'universal infrastructure', and 'green technology'. Based on evidence from three UK cities-Manchester, Birmingham, and Glasgow-it is argued that the underlying principle of future city strategies is to expand the market for new technology products and services to support 'green growth' with disregard for their wider impacts. For citizens, becoming a consumer of the technologies is often presented as progressive 'participation' or 'empowerment' with unknown or hidden consequences both political and environmental. The city systems become a digital marketplace where citizen-consumers' participation is increasingly involuntary and the hegemony of global technology firms is inflated. What follows is that the city's 'intelligent systems' are defined through a digital consumer experience that has inherent biases and leaves parts of the city and its population unaccounted for. This renders the city less resilient in the face of future social and climatic risks. {\textcopyright} 2014 Pion and its Licensors.},

We discuss that the Smart City literature must better include analysis around social sustainability issues for city dwellers. Focus here should start on health issues and more critical analysis about whom the Smart City is for. Also, the literature must address issues of resilience and cyber security, including how Smart City solutions may affect the autonomy of urban governance, personal integrity and how it may affect the resilience of infrastructures that provide inhabitants with basic needs, such as food, energy and water security. A third major gap in this literature is how smart city developments may change human-nature relations. Focus here should start on how Smart City technologies may hinder or support children's learning towards a stronger psychological connection with nature. Discussions are also needed on how the Smart City model may affect pro-environmental behavior more broadly.},

This 'cause deleted' life expectancy was highly correlated with homicide rates; a measure of economic inequality added significant additional prediction, whereas median household income did not. Deaths from internal causes (diseases) show similar age patterns, despite different absolute levels, in the best and worst neighbourhoods, whereas deaths from external causes (homicide, accident, suicide) do not. As life expectancy declines across neighbourhoods, women reproduce earlier; by age 30, however, neighbourhood no longer affects age specific fertility. These results support the hypothesis that life expectancy itself may be a psychologically salient determinant of risk taking and the timing of life transitions.},

Public policies and economic practices which increase marginalisation act to damage the “weak ties” of the community social networks which bind central city neighbourhoods into functioning units.

abstract = {This paper develops a conceptual link between smart city planning and urban food systems research in terms of governance and innovation. The 'smart city' concept is linked to an urban research agenda which seeks to embed advances in technology and data collection into the infrastructures of urban environments. Through this neoliberal framework, market-led and technological solutions to city governance and development are prioritised. The urban food movement has a different trajectory compared to the smart city agenda, comprising a diverse mix of urban food production practices, including community and grassroots-based social innovations, and associated more recently with food security discourses. Recognising these ideological and epistemological differences (between the smart city and the urban food movement) is important for conceptualisations of 'smart food city' governance. Based on theoretical reflections, review material and findings from a European project on city-region food systems, the paper argues that smart technology can be an important part of the solution to city food challenges but in combination with social innovations to enable flexible modes of governance that are inclusive, technologically and socially-orientated and linked to specific city-region contexts. Key elements include city regionalism, new organisational structures and connectivities, a circular model of metabolism and social practices.},

@article{Woodward2000a,
abstract = {It is well known that social, cultural and economic factors cause substantial inequalities in health. Should we strive to achieve a more even share of good health, beyond improving the average health status of the population? We examine four arguments for the reduction of health inequalities. 1 Inequalities are unfair. Inequalities in health are undesirable to the extent that they are unfair, or unjust. Distinguishing between health inequalities and health inequities can be contentious. Our view is that inequalities become ″unfair″ when poor health is itself the consequence of an unjust distribution of the underlying social determinants of health (for example, unequal opportunities in education or employment). 2 Inequalities affect everyone. Conditions that lead to marked health disparities are detrimental to all members of society. Some types of health inequalities have obvious spillover effects on the rest of society, for example, the spread of infectious diseases, the consequences of alcohol and drug misuse, or the occurrence of violence and crime. 3 Inequalities are avoidable. Disparities in health are avoidable to the extent that they stem from identifiable policy options exercised by governments, such as tax policy, regulation of business and labour, welfare benefits and health care funding. It follows that health inequalities are, in principle, amenable to policy interventions. A government that cares about improving the health of the population ought therefore to incorporate considerations of the health impact of alternative options in its policy setting process. 3 Interventions to reduce health inequalities are cost effective. Public health programmes that reduce health inequalities can also be cost effective. The case can be made to give priority to such programmes (for example, improving access to cervical cancer screening in low income women) on efficiency grounds. On the other hand, few programmes designed to reduce health inequalities have been formally evaluated using cost effectiveness analysis. We conclude that fairness is likely to be the most influential argument in favour of acting to reduce disparities in health, but the concept of equity is contested and susceptible to different interpretations. There is persuasive evidence for some outcomes that reducing inequalities will diminish ″spill over″ effects on the health of society at large. In principle, you would expect that differences in health status that are not biologically determined are avoidable. However, the mechanisms giving rise to inequalities are still imperfectly understood, and evidence remains to be gathered on the effectiveness of interventions to reduce such inequalities.},

This systematic review aimed to determine the effectiveness of mHealth interventions on behavioural lifestyle changes and medication adherence for cardiovascular disease self-management. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted from inception through to 3 March 2015 using MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library. Eligible studies used an experimental trial design to determine the effectiveness of an mHealth intervention to change lifestyle behaviours in any cardiovascular disease population. Data extracted included intervention and comparison group characteristics with a specific focus on the use of behaviour change techniques. Results Seven studies met our inclusion criteria and were included in the qualitative synthesis. All interventions were delivered in part by mobile phone text messaging. Three studies were effective at improving adherence to medication and two studies increased physical activity behaviour. No effects were observed on dietary behaviour or smoking cessation, measured in one study each. Simple text messaging interventions appeared to be most effective; however, no clear relationships were found between study findings and intervention dose, duration or behaviour change techniques targeted. Conclusions Our review found mHealth has the potential to change lifestyle behaviour. Results are still limited to a small number of trials, inconsistent outcome measures and ineffective reporting of intervention characteristics. Large scale, longitudinal studies are now warranted to gain a clear understanding of the effects of mHealth on behaviour change in the cardiovascular disease population.},

Objective: To perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies to compare the efficacy of mobile phone apps compared with other approaches to promote weight loss and increase physical activity. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of relevant studies identified by a search of PubMed, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Scopus from their inception through to August 2015. Two members of the study team (EG-F, GF-M) independently screened studies for inclusion criteria and extracted data. We included all controlled studies that assessed a mobile phone app intervention with weight-related health measures (ie, body weight, body mass index, or waist circumference) or physical activity outcomes. Net change estimates comparing the intervention group with the control group were pooled across studies using random-effects models. Results: We included 12 articles in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Compared with the control group, use of a mobile phone app was associated with significant changes in body weight (kg) and body mass index (kg/m2) of -1.04 kg (95% CI -1.75 to -0.34; I2 = 41%) and -0.43 kg/m2 (95% CI -0.74 to -0.13; I2 = 50%), respectively. Moreover, a nonsignificant difference in physical activity was observed between the two groups (standardized mean difference 0.40, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.87; I2 = 93%). These findings were remarkably robust in the sensitivity analysis. No publication bias was shown. Conclusions: Evidence from this study shows that mobile phone app-based interventions may be useful tools for weight loss.},

The article is based on a number of review articles and keynote lectures given by the author, and complemented with informal interviews of experts from different scientific fields engaged in the field of technology and ageing. Results show that research has emerged from being technology-focussed to scenario-based taking different scientific perspectives into account. However, the biggest challenge still is to accommodate the need for a holistic integrated service which means to provide personalised services and adapt technology and content to individual needs of different stakeholders. Further, cross-disciplinary research is needed that relates informatics and technology to different stages of the aging process and that evaluates the effects of proposed technical solutions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Informa UK, Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper provides a brief overview of, and elaborates on, some of the presentations, discussions and conclusions from Day 4 of the 'WHO EURO 2014 International Healthy Cities Conference: Health and the City - Urban Living in the 21st Century', held in Athens, Greece on 25 October 2014. The Internet of Things (IoT) is made of sensors and other components that connect our version of the world made of atoms, i.e., humans/our bodies, our devices, vehicles, roads, buildings, plants, animals, etc., with a mirror digital version made of bits. This enables cities and regions to be self-aware and dynamically reconfigurable in real- or near-real-time, based on changes that are continuously monitored and captured by sensors, similar to the way the internal biological systems of a living being operate and respond to their environment (homeostasis). Data collected by various IoT sensors and processed via appropriate analytics can also help predict the immediate future with reasonable accuracy, which enables better planned responses and mitigation actions. Cities and regions can thus become more adaptable and resilient in face of adversity. Furthermore, IoT can link atoms (humans) to other atoms (humans) (again via bits), resulting in the formation of 'smart(er) communities' that are socially connected in new ways and potentially happier. Cities, but also less urbanised regions and the countryside, could all benefit from, and harness the power of, IoT to improve the health, well-being and overall quality of life of the local populations, actively engage citizens in a smarter governance of their region, empower them to better care for one another, promote stronger social inclusion, and ensure a greener, sustainable and more enjoyable environment for all. Technology can also help reverse the 'brain drain' from the countryside and smaller towns to larger metropolises by making the former more attractive and connected, with better services akin to those found in larger cities. The article also discusses some ways of measuring and benchmarking the performance of smart cities and their impact on well-being. However, it should be emphasised that technology is not a panacea and that other factors are equally important in creating happier and healthier cities and regions.},

abstract = {It has long been recognised that urban form impacts on health outcomes and their determinants. There is growing interest in creating indicators of liveability to measure progress towards achieving a wide range of policy outcomes, including enhanced health and wellbeing, and reduced inequalities. This review aimed to: 1) bring together the concepts of urban 'liveability' and social determinants of health; 2) synthesise the various liveability indicators developed to date; and 3) assess their quality using a health and wellbeing lens. Between 2011 and 2013, the research team reviewed 114 international academic and policy documents, as well as reports related to urban liveability. Overall, 233 indicators were found. Of these, 61 indicators were regarded as promising, 57 indicators needed further development, and 115 indicators were not useful for our purposes. Eleven domains of liveability were identified that likely contribute to health and wellbeing through the social determinants of health. These were: crime and safety; education; employment and income; health and social services; housing; leisure and culture; local food and other goods; natural environment; public open space; transport; and social cohesion and local democracy. Many of the indicators came from Australian sources; however most remain relevant from a 'global north' perspective. Although many indicators were identified, there was inconsistency in how these domains were measured. Few have been validated to assess their association with health and wellbeing outcomes, and little information was provided for how they should be applied to guide urban policy and practice. There is a substantial opportunity to further develop these measures to create a series of robust and evidence-based liveability indices, which could be linked with existing health and wellbeing data to better inform urban planning policies within Australia and beyond. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Smart urbanism seems to be everywhere you turn. But in practice the agenda is an uncertain one, usually only partially developed, and often more about corporate-led urban development than about urban social justice. Rather than leave smart urbanism to the corporate and political elites, there are opportunities now for critical urban scholarship to not only critique how it is currently constituted, but to give shape to a globally oriented alternative smart urban agenda. An ambition like this means taking the ‘urban' in ‘smart urban' much more seriously. It means foregrounding the knowledges, political priorities and needs of those either actively excluded or included in damaging ways in mainstream smart urban discourses. We outline steps towards an alternative smart urbanism. We seek to move beyond the specific to the general and do so by drawing on radically different initiatives across the Global North and South. These initiatives provide tantalizing openings to a more socially just use of digital technology, where urban priorities and justice drive the use—or lack of use—of technology.},

First, that although many definitions of the smart city have been proposed, corporate promoters say a smart city uses information technology to pursue efficient systems through real-time monitoring and control. Second, this definition is not new and equivalent to the idea of urban cybernetics debated in the 1970s. Third, drawing on a discussion of Rio de Janeiro's Operations Center, I argue that viewing urban problems as wicked problems allows for more fundamental solutions than urban cybernetics, but requires local innovation and stakeholder participation. Therefore the last section describes institutions for municipal innovation and IT-enabled collaborative planning.},

@article{Capdevila2015d,
abstract = {Purpose – In recent years, the term “smart city” has attracted a lot of attention from policy makers, business leaders and citizenship in general. Although there is not a unique definition of what a smart city is, it is generally accepted that “smart” urban policies refer to local governments' initiatives that use information and communication technologies in order to increase the quality of life of their inhabitants while contributing to a sustainable development. So far, “smart city” approaches have generally been related to top-down processes of technology diffusion. The purpose of this paper is to present a broader view on “smart” initiatives to analyze both top-down and bottom-up dynamics in a smart city. The authors argue that these two perspectives are complementary and its combination can reinforce the collaboration between different city stakeholders. Top-down and bottom-up initiatives are not opposed forces but, on the contrary, can have a synergistic effect on the innovation capacity of the city. Both perspectives are illustrated by providing examples of different “smart” aspects in the city of Barcelona: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. Design/methodology/approach – To illustrate the arguments, the authors analyze the case of the city of Barcelona providing examples of top-down and bottom-up initiatives in four different smart city aspects: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. The research method is based on a case study (Yin, 1984). The primary data consisted on interviews to city council representatives as well as managers of local public institutions, like economic development offices, and local organizations like for instance coworking spaces. The authors interviewed also specialists on the innovation history of the city in order to validate the data. In addition, the authors used secondary data such as reports on the 22@, and documentation on the Barcelona innovation policies, as well as doing a compilation of press articles and the online content of the institutional webpages. All together, the authors have followed a data triangulation strategy to seek data validation based on the cross-verification of the analyzed data sources. Findings – The analysis suggests that the top-down and bottom-up perspectives are complementary and their combination can reinforce the collaboration between different city stakeholders. Top-down and bottom-up initiatives are not opposed forces but, on the contrary, can have a synergistic effect on the innovation capacity of the city. Both perspectives are illustrated by providing examples of different “smart” aspects in the city of Barcelona: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. Research limitations/implications – Nevertheless, the analysis has its limitations. Even if the authors have emphasized the importance of the bottom-up initiatives, citizens do not have often the resources to act without governmental intervention. This is the case of services that require high-cost infrastructures or regulatory changes. Also, as it usually happens in the case of disruptive technology, it is hard for citizens to understand the possibilities of its use. In these cases, firms and institutions must play an important role in the first phases of the diffusion of innovations, by informing and incentivizing its use. It is also important to note that some of the emerging usages of technology are confronted to legal or regulatory issues. For instance, distributed and shared Wi-Fi networks might be in opposition to economic interests of internet providers, that often difficult its expansion. It is also the case of services of the sharing economy that represent a menace to established institutions (like the tensions between Uber and taxi companies, or Airbnb and hotels). In these cases, city halls like it is the case in Barcelona, tend to respond to these emergent uses of technology by regulating to ensure protection to existing corporate services. Practical implications – In conclusion, the transformational process that leads a city to become a smart city has to take in consideration the complexity and the plurality of the urban reality. Beyond considering citizens as being users, testers or consumers of technology, local administrations that are able to identify, nourish and integrate the emerging citizens' initiatives would contribute to the reinforcement of a smart city reality. Originality/value – The contribution of the paper is to go beyond the generalized technologic discourse around smart cities by adding the layer of the citizens' initiatives.},

This paper focuses on the former and, drawing on a number of examples, details how cities are being instrumented with digital devices and infrastructure that produce 'big data'. Such data, smart city advocates argue enables real-time analysis of city life, new modes of urban governance, and provides the raw material for envisioning and enacting more efficient, sustainable, competitive, productive, open and transparent cities. The final section of the paper provides a critical reflection on the implications of big data and smart urbanism, examining five emerging concerns: the politics of big urban data, technocratic governance and city development, corporatisation of city governance and technological lock-ins, buggy, brittle and hackable cities, and the panoptic city. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Smart cities are increasingly advocated by governments and the private sector as the primary means to deliver urban sustainability. Particularly in Europe and North America, the smart city is envisioned as a place where digital technologies are deployed to ‘solve' urban sustainability problems. Such visions have been broadly critiqued in the urban studies literature for reflecting techno-utopian, neoliberal approaches to urban development that exert corporate control over cities, but there has been little empirical verification of these critiques. More recently, a disparate and interdisciplinary body of literature has emerged documenting the impacts of smart city initiatives in practice. This paper provides a state-of-the-art, empirically informed analysis of smart-sustainability, which considers established critiques of smart city policy and visions alongside the increasing body of evidence concerning the actual experiences of smart city initiatives. Through a systematic review of the smart city literature pertaining to Europe and North America, we identify and test five tensions between the smart city and the goals of sustainable urban development. These tensions involve: (1) reinforcing neoliberal economic growth; (2) focusing on more affluent populations; (3) disempowering and marginalising citizens; (4) neglecting environmental protection; and, (5) failing to challenge prevailing consumerist cultures. On the basis of these findings we propose how digital technologists, urban developers, municipalities and citizens might address these tensions. A key finding is that the potential to empower and include citizens represents the key to unlocking forms of smart-sustainable urban development that emphasise environmental protection and social equity, rather than merely reinforcing neoliberal forms of urban development.},

Using this periodisation, the paper shows how the content of urban sustainability discourse has changed. First, it illustrates that the dominant assumption of sustainable cities' discourse was to utilise economic growth to ecologically modernise urban environments. Second, it examines how the global economic crisis has intensified this fix and led to a new, even narrower emphasis on the techno-economic value of those aspects of urban environment that have economic and market potential. Third, it analyses the fragmenting of sustainable cities' discourse into a set of competing logics that reflect this narrower agenda. This paper argues that the sustainable city has been absorbed into these new logics that are much more narrowly techno-economically focused and are squeezing out traditional concerns with social justice and equity.},

abstract = {While scholars critique the first-generation of the corporate smart city for failing to tackle people-oriented agendas and authentically respond to the needs of residents, many point to a potential to move beyond narrow environmental and economic objectives and tackle social issues. But concrete empirical evidence of this potential is visibly lacking. In parallel, researchers have brought attention to the emergence of the so-called ‘smart city 2.0'. This is framed as a decentralised, people-centric approach where smart technologies are employed as tools to tackle social problems, address resident needs and foster collaborative participation. This contrasts to the techno-economic and centralised approach of the dominating ‘smart city 1.0' or first-generation paradigm, which is primarily focused on diffusing smart technologies for corporate and economic interests. Utilising this dichotomy as an analytical framework, this paper examines Aizuwakamatsu Smart City in Fukushima, Japan to demonstrate how a smart city can be framed and implemented as a tool for tackling endogenous social challenges. Findings unearth a myriad of novel approaches to utilising data and ICT to respond to resident needs, improve livelihoods and widely share smart city benefits. Yet they also point to a need to transcend polarised discourses around alternative models of smart cities and appreciate the messy reality of hybrid, on-the-ground smart urbanisation and the co-existence of contrasting yet complementary visions and approaches.},

Through the systematic and widespread application of technologies such as wearable health monitors, the creation of open data platforms for health parameters, and the development of virtual communication between patients and health professionals, the smart city can serve as a means to improve the lives of urban residents. In this article, we present a case study of smart health in Kashiwanoha Smart City in Japan. We explore how the pursuit of greater health and well-being has stretched smart city activities beyond technological innovation to directly impact resident lifestyles and become more socially relevant. Smart health strategies examined include a combination of experiments in monitoring and visualisation, education through information provision, and enticement for behavioural change.

While proponents argue that smart cities will bring positive social change by the adoption of ICTs, enriched governance and human capital among the citizenry, opponents point out about the negative effects and gaps exist in their planning and execution. Despite efforts to promote its practice, there has been wide criticism about the concept and the way it has been adopted and implemented. The roles of various players, especially the central role of the private sector, is often challenged in the academic literature. A variety of expectations from various stakeholders make the potential implementation strategies even more complex. The current paper reviews the research in the field to date to find that there are conflicting views in smart city planning, which limit our knowledge about the ‘real' smart city and its implications for building creative and inclusive urban space. Such uncertainty at the conceptual level, and the heightened importance given by policy makers and markets to its adoption, highlights the need for proper scrutiny. The paper clusters the various views pertaining to the building of smart cities and, thereby, proposes a 3RC framework, consisting of Restrictive, Reflective, Rationalistic and Critical schools, which critically analyses various stages in the development of the field. The overall aim of the paper is to understand how smart cities differ in their meanings, intentions and ‘offerings'.},

In 2009, Gunder and Hillier argued sustainability is now urban planning's central empty signifier, offering an overarching narrative around which practice can be oriented. This paper takes up the notion of sustainability as an empty/master-signifier, arguing that the recognition of its nominal status is central to understanding how it operates to produce ideological foundation. Drawing upon a series of interviews and focus groups with urban and social policy makers and practitioners in Vancouver, Canada, Zizek's 1989 critique of the cynical functioning of contemporary ideology is used to interpret the city's engagement with sustainability. Focusing on 'social sustainability' it is argued that sustainability has provided a quilting point that has enabled new social and urban policy-related partnerships and organizational agendas to be developed. However, this coherence remains unstable and plagued by questions of signification due to the radical negativity of the master-signifier, where efforts at definition and agreement are haunted by the non-presence of sustainability. It is argued that this framing of sustainability as ideological conduit in Vancouver helps explain the co-presence of transformative rhetoric and business-as-usual. Using Zizek's critique of cynical reason in contemporary ideology, interview data is drawn upon to show how many practitioners seek to distance themselves from sustainability, but at the same time continue to act it out anyway. In conclusion, the sobering politics of Zizek's critique of contemporary ideology are considered in the light of growing urban problems. {\textcopyright} 2010 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract = {Significant global health challenges are being confronted in the 21st century, prompting calls to rethink approaches to disease prevention. A key part of the solution is city planning that reduces non-communicable diseases and road trauma while also managing rapid urbanisation. This Series of papers considers the health impacts of city planning through transport mode choices. In this, the first paper, we identify eight integrated regional and local interventions that, when combined, encourage walking, cycling, and public transport use, while reducing private motor vehicle use. These interventions are destination accessibility, equitable distribution of employment across cities, managing demand by reducing the availability and increasing the cost of parking, designing pedestrian-friendly and cycling-friendly movement networks, achieving optimum levels of residential density, reducing distance to public transport, and enhancing the desirability of active travel modes (eg, creating safe attractive neighbourhoods and safe, affordable, and convenient public transport). Together, these interventions will create healthier and more sustainable compact cities that reduce the environmental, social, and behavioural risk factors that affect lifestyle choices, levels of traffic, environmental pollution, noise, and crime. The health sector, including health ministers, must lead in advocating for integrated multisector city planning that prioritises health, sustainability, and liveability outcomes, particularly in rapidly changing low-income and middle-income countries. We recommend establishing a set of indicators to benchmark and monitor progress towards achievement of more compact cities that promote health and reduce health inequities.},

abstract = {Urban infrastructure systems responsible for the provision of energy, transportation, shelter, and communication to populations are important determinants of health and health equity. The term “smart city” has been used synonymously with other terms, such as “digital city”, “sustainable city”, and “information city”, even though definitional distinctions exist between terms. In this review, we use “smart cities” as a catch-all term to refer to an emerging concept in urban governance practice and scholarship that has been increasingly applied to achieve public health aims. The objective of this systematic review was to document and analyze the inclusion of equity considerations and dimensions (i.e., a measurement, analytical, or dialectical focus on systematic disparities in health between groups) in smart city interventions aimed to improve human health and well-being. Systematic searches were carried out in the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Psychological Information Database (PsycINFO), the PubMed database from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, Elsevier's database Scopus, and Web of Science, returning 3219 titles. Ultimately, 28 articles were retained, assessed, and coded for their inclusion of equity characteristics using the Cochrane PROGRESS-Plus tool (referring to (P) place of residence, (R) race, (O) occupation, (G) gender, (R) religion, (E) education, (S) socio-economic status (SES), and (S) social capital). The most frequently included equity considerations in smart city health interventions were place of residence, SES, social capital, and personal characteristics; conversely, occupation, gender or sex, religion, race, ethnicity, culture, language, and education characteristics were comparatively less featured in such interventions. Overall, it appears that most of intervention evaluations assessed in this review are still in the early testing phases, and thus did not include or feature robust evaluative designs or commercially available technologies},

The contributions are the commonalities and differences between Smart City initiatives in developed economies and in South Africa. The findings revealed that in developed countries the focus was mainly on e-services, citizen engagement, Intelligent Transport Systems and energy systems. They provided city-wide connectivity and addressed integration and interoperability challenges. The technologies included large IoT sensors and WiFi in-motion networks incorporating internationally accepted standards. Initiatives in South Africa were less mature, mostly in the initial stages and are not addressing other more urgent needs of the country such as water, food, shelter and education.

In its efforts to transform Malaysia to a developed and industrialized country, the government started to focus on industry and high technology in the 1980s. A key area of focus was Information Technology (IT). The government chose to adopt several policies with respect to the supply and demand sides of IT instead of a national IT plan1. The policies addressed IT infrastructure, education and training, research and development, use of IT in the public sector, and fiscal incentives. These IT policies and the broad economic and industrial policies implemented during this period had a positive influence on demand for IT products and services, number of IT professionals, number of telephones per 100 population, and IT production and use. This experience has laid a firm foundation for formulating more definitive national IT policies for the 1990s and in achieving the government's objective of transforming Malaysia into a developed and information rich society by 2020. {\textcopyright} 1996 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Addressing the gap of ICT skills is one of the fundamental options to grow and develop the capacity of people to effectively participate in economic activities. The general objective of this qualitative study was to explore how digital literacy skills can advance the lives of people currently searching for employment. Data were obtained using semi-structured interviews with participants who were not employed and with diverse school backgrounds. The results indicate a need to strengthen existing digital literacy programmes for NEET people. Most of the interviewed NEET people experienced challenges when seeking work on digital platforms, because they are not skilled in digital literacy. Analysis of the data from interview transcripts revealed that there is an array of challenges which prevent NEET people from efficiently using ICTs when searching for work opportunities. These include the high cost of Internet connections and the lack of knowledge of how to use these digital platforms. The study concludes that digital literacy is one of the skills which remains critical for work seekers to increase their chances of achieving continuous work opportunities, and eventually obtain employment or become employers themselves. It is hoped that this study will contribute to the continuous discussions about the lack of digital literacy skills among young people who are economically inactive.},

abstract = {The social sustainability of information and communication technology for development (ICT4D) projects such as e-government in developing nations remains a vexing issue. Particularly pertinent to the concept of e-government is that of electronic participation (e-participation) of citizens in services offered over an e-government platform, yet studies claim that such initiatives exacerbate the social exclusion problem. Globally, and specifically in Africa, the ineffective participation of citizens is marked by waning confidence in service delivery capabilities of political institutions, yet e-government is considered as one of the reform instrument for the attainment of good governance. Governments and pressure groups in many countries are realizing that these trends are problematic and are seeking to broaden and deepen citizen participation in governance, notably through the use of mobile technologies that continues to play a vital role in the trajectory of ICT development in Africa. This study advances the prominent role that mobile technology will play in anchoring e-participation strategies and policies to improve the social sustainability of ICT4D projects geared toward improving governance. The paper presents the results of cluster analysis of a survey aimed at assessing the accessibility, attitudes and the skills necessary for embedding mobile technology as part of an e-participation strategy.},

Key challenges include addressing multiple literacies such as health literacy, financial literacy and eSafety for low-literate learners in low-resource settings with low internet bandwidth, lack of ICT facilities and intermittent electricity. Design/methodology/approach: This research implemented an educational model based on the proposed framework to train over 1,000 indigenous people using an integrated curriculum for digital literacies at remote settlements. The model uses mobile technology adapted for remote areas, context enabled curriculum, along with flexible learning schedules. Findings: The education model exemplifies a viable strategy to overcome persistent challenges by taking tablet-based digital literacies directly to communities. It engages different actors such as existing civil societies, schools and government organizations to provide digital literacy and awareness thereby improving both digital and life skills. It demonstrates the potential value of a comprehensive Digital Literacy framework as a powerful lever for Digital Inclusion. Practical Implications: Policy makers can use this transformational model to extend the reach and effectiveness of Digital Inclusion through the last mile enhancing existing training and service centers that offer the traditional model of Digital Literacy Education. Originality/value: This innovative mobile learning model based on the proposed Digital Framework for Inclusion instilled motivation, interest and confidence while providing effective digital training and conducting exams directly in the tribal settlements for low-literate learners in remote settings. Through incorporating multiple literacies, this model serves to empower learners, enhance potential, improve well-being and reduce the risk of exploitation.},

In this article, we empirically examine the relationship between objective e-government performance on the supply side and the perceptions of citizens on the demand side. A multilevel analysis of over 28,000 respondents across 32 European countries reveals that highly ranked e-government is warmly welcomed by citizens, suggesting that the supply and demand sides of e-government are, in part, consistent. Specifically, the e-government performance–satisfaction correlations in e-service and e-participation are more prominent than that of e-information. The results also show that citizens' perceived e-government benefits are mainly from using online services. While e-government rankings are reasonably predictive of citizen satisfaction, they should be referred to with caveats in e-government policies. Points for practitioners: The empirical findings reveal that objective e-government performance is partially congruent with citizens' satisfaction and perceived benefits. While e-government rankings may not be good predictors of citizen use, they do coincide, in part, with citizen satisfaction. Ubiquitous e-government benchmarks can be referred to as reliable gauges of citizen satisfaction, though their susceptibility varies across the purposes of e-government use. The various benefits that citizens perceived from e-government are primarily derived through online services instead of electronic information or participation, and the government should pay more attention to e-service development in order to bring more benefits to its users.},

Computer self-efficacy is shown to have a significant negative relationship with behavioural intention and resistance to change. Our results further demonstrate that trustworthiness is inversely related to resistance to change. Small island developing states should engage in proper awareness campaigns of e-Government services offered and focusing their efforts on citizens aged 18–39 years old to obtain a critical mass of users. Website design and information quality should be improved paying particular attention to security and privacy, thereby increasing trust and reducing resistance to change.},

abstract = {We hypothesize that four key national factors of e-readiness are associated with e-business and e-government development: national economic prosperity, technological innovativeness, institutional maturity, and Internet service provider competition. Using hierarchical regression with cross-sectional data on 122 countries, we show that these hypothesized factors are independently associated with nations' reported developmental success in the areas of e-government and e-business. These results are obtained using data for 2006 and are replicated using data for 2007. Between-groups analysis using regression provides evidence of the model's applicability to both developed and developing nations, where the four factors can serve as parsimonious indicators for e-readiness and as key areas for public policy. We then discuss implications and limitations of the present work. We conclude by highlighting the current outlook for progress in developing nations along the four dimensions investigated and suggest a targeted approach for public policy. {\textcopyright} 2010 Commonwealth Secretariat.},

abstract = {From the government's perspective, it is important to understand the factors that influence effective utilization of new service channels, particularly the use of smart devices. Furthermore, how the utilization of a new channel affects trust in the government is an important performance factor whose linkage mechanism also needs to be investigated. This study collected 417 questionnaires from Korean citizens who communicate with the government via smart devices; the questionnaires were analyzed using structural equation analysis. This research indicates that in order to maximize trust in government, service delivery via smart devices must be designed with a clear understanding of the three significant components of such communication, namely the service, channel, and citizens. The service selected must be appropriate to the characteristics of the channel, and service reform may be necessary, beyond using the channel simply as a service means. Citizens' ability to utilize the channel must also be fully considered. In order to increase the efficacy of new channel utilization, fast implementation is less important than understanding how to satisfy citizens' needs regarding use of the public service via a smart device.},

abstract = {Feature selection is one of the crucial steps in supervised learning, which influences the entire subsequent classification (or regression) process. The approaches to this task can largely be divided into two categories: filter-based and wrapper-based methods. Generally, the latter produces better results than the former with regard to given learning methods, though it consumes more computational resources for searches over the feature subset space. In this paper, we propose an Efficient wRapper based on a Paired t-Test (ERPT) for choosing features from large-scale data consisting of thousands of variables, such as microarrays. Statistical tests are a reasonable option when the number of features is very large because they have more predictable behavior and can be more efficient than most search methods. The proposed method consists of two phases: decrement phase and increment phase. In the decrement phase, it selects strongly relevant features. In the increment phase, it adds weakly relevant features, given the previously selected features. Our method, combined with naive Bayes classifiers, has been tested in an extensive set of experiments on University of California Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository data. The results showed that the performance of the proposed method is comparable to that of the backward search-based wrapper and superior to that of the forward search-based wrapper. Furthermore, it demonstrated much better performance than the forward search-based wrapper when applied to three microarray data sets, for which the backward search-based wrapper was impractical because of the computational burden involved. The proposed method has the following three merits: (1) it is applicable to data sets having thousands of variables, (2) it provides a theoretically sound and controllable criterion for thresholding features, and (3) it finds feature subsets for the maximizing of classification performance on sparse domains. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

And the confirmatory factor analysis with responses obtained from another set of 496 adult learners confirmed a good fit of the seven-factor model to the observed data. While most of these seven dimensions are supported by previous studies, some dimensions, such as technology support, content and evaluation/assessment that e-learning providers had highlighted did not appear to be important for Korean adult learners.

In this regard, paying special attention to the investigation of main drivers, stakeholders and challenges of the open data movement in Estonia, the author argues that a highly centralized administrative policy that has been widely used previously by authorities in advancing various technology-driven public reforms, which partly explains a truly impressive advance of this Nordic state in e-government, e-commerce, e-banking and evoting, does not necessarily lead to same effective results in the open data domain. On the contrary, the presence of established democratic institutions and developed civil society as well as an incredibly advanced and dynamic private ICTindustry that values competition and professional curiosity along with a very strong sense of patriotism and adherence to a particular neighborhood deeply rooted in Estonian society has played a much more important role in diffusing the concept rather than just traditional government directives and strategies.},

However, the interrelationships between the facets of trustworthiness are given inadequate attention. Therefore, the aim of this research was to develop a theory detailing the factors affecting citizens' perceptions of e-government trustworthiness. A comprehensive review of public administration and information systems literature highlighted 20 pertinent variables. The interrelationships of these variables were identified and categorized according to their driving and dependence power by employing interpretive structural modelling. The proposed model was then drawn based on the level partitioning of variables and interrelationships of the variables determined using the final reachability matrix. The findings reveal that current conceptualizations of digital government trustworthiness take a too narrow view. The findings can help government policy makers with understanding the interrelated factors associated with trustworthiness in the context of digital government services and implement them in effective strategic planning.},

To explore the relationships among factors and the educational effectiveness of mobile LMSs, students' demographic backgrounds (age and employment status), self-reported psychological data (self-efficacy, innovativeness, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness of mobile LMSs), and external factors (subjective norms) were collected from 1604 students from 10 repetitions of the same course in an online university in Korea, in addition to their test scores. The logistic regression results showed that age and employment status were significant factors in predicting students' adoption of mobile LMSs and that there were potential connections between mobile LMS use and students' gender, age, and psychological characteristics.

Well-structured problems are constrained problems with convergent solutions that engage the application of a limited number of rules and principles within well-defined parameters. Ill-structured problems possess multiple solutions, solution paths, fewer parameters which are less manipulable, and contain uncertainty about which concepts, rules, and principles are necessary for the solution or how they are organized and which solution is best. For both types of problems, this paper presents models for how learners solve them and models for designing instruction to support problem-solving skill development. The model for solving well-structured problems is based on information processing theories of learning, while the model for solving ill-structured problems relies on an emerging theory of ill-structured problem solving and on constructivist and situated cognition approaches to learning.},

Fromthe existing literature, we found thatmost of the studies consideredlack of technology, andlimitations in budgets andhuman resources as themain hurdles in effective implementation of e-government services. Alongwith these limitations, we found that the e-government maturity models adopted by developing countries are failing to provide an appropriate strategic plan to deploy sustainable e-government services. While assessing the existing e-government maturity model, we made several observations on the lack of detail, the technology-centric nature, the emphasis on implementation, and the lack of an adoption strategy. This work contributes toward the proposition of a new e-governmentmaturitymodel that would address the limitations of exiting e-governmentmaturity models, and would support governments in developing countries to achieve sustainable e-government services. To achieve this goal, we considered five determinants-a detailed process, streamlined services, agile accessibility, use of state-of-the-art technology, and trust and awareness. The proposed model was validated by employing an empirical investigation through case-study and surveymethods. We found that both the implementers (government) and adopters (users) of the e-government services benefited fromthe proposedmodel, resulting in an increased sustainability of e-government services.},

The goal is to answer the question whether big data is a fleeting trend or has long-lasting effects on policymaking. Three larger themes in the literature are identified: First, the role that institutional capacity has within government to utilize big data analytics; second, government use of big data analytics in the context of digital public services; and finally, the way that big data information enters the policy cycle, focusing on substantive and procedural policy instruments. Examples from the education, crisis management, environmental and healthcare domain highlight the opportunities and challenges for each of these themes. Exploring the various aspects of big data and policymaking shows that big data is here to stay, but that its utilization by government will take time due to institutional barriers and capacity bottlenecks.},

High users of information and communications technologies (ICT) were more likely to use e-government measures, and are more positive towards e-government in general across several measures. Similar to a number of U.S. studies, we find a 'digital divide,' where older age, and less education were associated with lower ICT and e-government use and support. Income level was not a statistically significant predictor in all cases however, and gender was not significant for e-government support. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

abstract = {This chapter continues the basic issue addressed in the previous chapter, but considers the comparison of two means when you have dependent or paired samples. This usually means in practice that you have the same group of people comparing different “variables.” For example, you may be considering mean satisfaction level for two different designs, where each design is evaluated by the same sample of people. Or, the quantity of interest might be the time to complete a task, or a myriad of other variables. In all these cases, we use what is called the paired two-sample t-test. This chapter discusses and illustrates this technique and goes into detail instructing the reader on how to perform the test using Excel and SPSS, and how to interpret the results. It also contrasts this test with the two-sample t-test of the previous chapter.},

abstract = {Having digital literacy requires more than just the ability to use software or to operate a digital device; it includes a large variety of complex skills such as cognitive, motoric, sociological and emotional skills that users need to master in order to use digital environments effectively. Unfor-tunately, the research on digital literacy lacks a well-established theoretical framework. This pa-per presents an updated version of the skills-based theoretical framework, published by Eshet-Alkalai in 2004 – adding to it a sixth skill (real-time thinking skill), and discussing the model in light of the recent literature on digital literacy. The updated model of digital literacy consists of the following skills: photo-visual skills (understanding messages from graphical displays), repro-duction skills (utilizing digital reproduction to create new, meaningful materials from preexisting ones), branching skills (constructing knowledge from non-linear, hypertextual navigation), infor-mation skills (critically evaluating the quality and validity of information), socio-emotional skills (understanding the " rules " that prevail in the cyberspace and applying this understanding in vir-tual communication), and real-time thinking (the ability to process large volumes of stimuli at the same time, as in video games or in online teaching). The present paper presents results from per-formance-based studies of the author, that investigated the application of the above digital literacy skills conceptual model among different groups of users. Results clearly indicate that the younger participants performed better than the older ones, with photo-visual and branching literacy tasks, whereas the older participants were found to be more "digitally-literate" in reproduction and in-formation literacy tasks. The paper presents findings from recent studies that examined change over time in digital literacy skills. It sheds light on the cognitive skills that users utilize in per-forming with digital environments, and provides educators and software developers with helpful guidelines for designing better user-centered digital environments.},

Therefore, it is prudent to incorporate information communication technology (ICT) skills into the skills matrix required by the practitioners in order to deliver the service effectively. Furthermore, ICT use is prevalent in almost every organization, therefore, ICT can also serve as a major factor in flexibility of delivery of community development service to the communities, but only if the practitioners possess adequate skills in using ICT tools (software applications) in retrieving, presenting and disseminating valuable and adequate information within the workplace to the parties involved. The study determines the current work conditions, level of performance and expertise in the use of ICT among community development workers (CDWs) in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, by evaluating their abilities and experiences, with a view to identify the areas to enhance their effectiveness. Determining the competency of their use of ICT applications is not an easy task; thus a survey methodology was adopted, with a sample of 189 CDWs (63% female and 37% male). Respondents were given the opportunity to rate of their own current ability to use common computer software applications.},

abstract = {The use of mobile phones is an increasingly important part of development efforts particularly in low income countries. Investment in mobiles for development (m-development) is being led by the mobile phone industry together with donors and development partners across a wide range of development sectors. As adoption of mobile phones increases it becomes important to research and understand their impact, and to assess to what extent the expansion of m-development is assisting broader development efforts. This paper provides guidance for conducting research on impact assessment for m-development by reviewing 18 published impact studies, and suggests four key building blocks for good practice in impact assessment. These building blocks encompass: the extent to which the studies address the needs of defined audiences or beneficiaries, the choice of types of impact to assess and units of assessment, the application of suitable conceptual frameworks, and the rigor of the methodology followed. The findings suggest that m-development impact assessment to date falls into three main categories: purely quantitative approaches rooted in information economics, and purely qualitative approaches rooted in social impact assessment. A further mixed method category provides cost effective and timely findings, but with the result of diluting the rigor evident at the methodological poles. Overall, the paper concludes there is a need for more and better guidance for the conduct of such studies, in relation to identifying the rationale and objectives, and linking the choice of concepts and methods with the requirements of key audiences and beneficiaries. The paper identifies m-development impact research as a contested area, and by taking stock of experience thus far, seeks to raise the level of debate concerning the relative merit of alternative methodological and conceptual approaches. {\textcopyright} 2011 Commonwealth Secretariat.},

abstract = {This study examines the concept of electronic government (e-government) inclusiveness and evaluates the inclusiveness of local e-government websites. Inclusiveness sets e-government apart from other types of websites (e.g. commercial or organizational sites) that only serve exclusive market segments. An evaluation for inclusiveness of 101 local government websites from Mississippi (an underdeveloped area by many health and social metrics) revealed (1) a high frequency of issues that prevent inclusive service (on average each site had 291.83 issues), (2) high variability in terms of number of issues (range = [2, 3171]), and (3) widespread absence of websites (87 of the 188 municipalities and county seats did not have discoverable websites). These results suggest there is a need for more inclusiveness, but the allocation of resources to accomplish this may not be feasible. To address this, two strategic options are presented to information technology (IT) policy-makers who seek to leverage e-government for development: an idealistic approach with traditional IT investment for future returns and a pragmatic one that resembles an entrepreneurial IT start-up venture. The study contributes in three ways: we identify the concept and criteria of e-government inclusiveness; develop an automated, software-based, and replicable evaluation method that can be used by local governments to improve a website's inclusiveness; and present strategic options for using e-government to promote social and economic development.},

This 'handbook' operationalizes the theoretical approaches to lifelong learning as seen through the eyes of a senior adult. This book is a must read for those who have returned to both learning and formal education in later life. The handbook, structured into three sections includes the necessary background to understand aging adult learning, the philosophical, sociological, and psychological problems that older adults face daily, why older adults participate, and how they cope with learning. Each section is represented by practical chapters that allow the reader to decide what to take away while not passing judgment on the multinational policies that are currently in place. One interesting note is that the chapters do not have to be read in sequence, for this handbook contains pseudo-isolated chapters that stand on their own merit. It is easy to read ahead, as the introduction gives the reader a brief preview of what to expect. It is also easy to return to previous items of interest and tie them to adult education principles. All but the first chapter present a coda that provides the reader with a brief. This book is not a how-to manual but a fresh outlook that enlightens the reader on what is happening with learning for the older population.

Further comparative analysis was performed between the top Arab e-governments and the global top e-governments in developed countries with regard to "e-democracy," often the highest level e-government service delivery capability identified in the literature. The results confirm a wide digital divide that remains between the Arab countries and the leading developed countries. Importantly, however, the results also show a wide digital divide even among the Arab countries studied, particularly in the development of advanced e-government service delivery capabilities.

For multinational enterprises (MNEs), this has provided opportunities to develop and market technological innovations to facilitate the creation of smart cities, given that the deployment of information and communication technology (ICT) is commonly considered to be a central tenet of smart cities. This paper explores the strategic approaches of three MNEs from the ICT industry (IBM, Cisco, and Accenture) as suppliers of ‘smart city technologies' rooted in an international business perspective. Based on qualitative data collected from semi-structured interviews and documentation on firm activities related to smart cities, our study offers two contributions. First, the empirical analysis provides insight into how MNEs have developed resources and capabilities in the smart city realm from a multitude of smart city engagements globally, and shows how firm-specific strategies and programmes for smart cities (IBM Smarter Cities, Cisco Smart + Connected Communities, and Accenture Intelligent Cities) have facilitated this process. Second, it provides an actor-centric perspective on the (potential) role of business in the emergence and spread of technological innovations for urban development, helping to address the need for further insights into (smart) cities and stakeholder involvement in sustainability transitions.},

The current study explored whether and how the pedagogical design of an academic course, which developed a variety of digital literacy competencies, supported students in regulating collaborative technology-enhanced learning and helped them cope with the sense of psychological ownership over collaborative learning outcomes. In addition, we examined how these issues were expressed in cognitive, emotional and social aspects of students' perceived learning (Caspi & Blau, 2011). During four semesters, we conducted a qualitative analysis on reflective learning diaries, written by 78 graduate students studying education (N = 1870 codes). The bottom-up analysis focused on learning processes that enabled the development of various digital literacies conceptualized by the Digital Literacy Framework (DLF; Eshet-Alkalai, 2012): photo-visual, information, reproduction, branching, social-emotional, and real-time thinking skills. Furthermore, findings highlighted the importance of self-regulation and learning new technologies as an integral part of digital literacies. In addition, social-emotional statements expressed the development of effective communication and collaboration that enable students to cope with a sense of ownership over learning outcomes, and present different levels of teamwork: sharing, cooperation, and collaboration. Qualitative coding provided a more granulated perspective on perceived learning by differentiating between positive and negative aspects of emotional and social retrospection during the learning process. The findings contribute to educational theory by extending DLF and by providing new insights to the literature on students' perceived learning. We discuss the implications for instructional design and adoption of innovative pedagogy in higher education.},

A pressing issue for many governments is how to expand citizen acceptance of e-government systems. Prior studies on e-tax filing and payment systems have identified various factors for successful adoption, but do not capture the basic psychological needs of users in developing countries. This study examines the determinants of citizens' intention to adopt an e-tax filing and payment system in Thailand. The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology is integrated with self-determination theory, perceived risk, and perceived credibility to develop a model to explain the users' acceptance of e-government services. A large-scale survey of Thai taxpayers was conducted and the results show that performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence, and perceived credibility are all significant factors. Perceived autonomy and perceived competence are significant antecedents for performance and effort expectancy (EE). Perceived risk and EE surprisingly did not influence users' intentions. Several recommendations are proposed that have an immediate application for practitioners to aide in the successful adoption of e-government services.},

abstract = {The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is considered one of the best frameworks to understand technology-related adoptions that can be extended and adapted to the different features of many diverse situations. This work analyzes the adoption of e-government services and proposes that trust and personal values contribute to better understand such adoption. Specifically, this study proposes an integration of trust into the TAM, due to the online context characteristics (i.e., uncertainty). In addition, since these services are provided to the whole citizenry, two personal values very much related to e-government advantages (citizens' time consciousness and environmental concern) are proposed as moderators of the aforementioned relationships. Results reveal the mediating role of trust into the TAM framework which is confirmed by a rival models analysis. Besides, citizens' personal values moderate the influence of some antecedents of the intention to use e-government services, which suggests some interesting implications for public administration strategic marketing. {\textcopyright} 2011 ACEDE.},

Accordingly, and following recent qualitative research on the digital divide, we believe future scholarship must examine the complicated relationships between poverty, inequality, and the digital divide and we look to poverty scholarship to understand the complicated and shifting nature of poverty. Finally, we make the case that scholars and practitioners focused on digital literacy programs should pay attention to historical and critical scholarship on education and its role in mediating poverty and fostering social mobility, as it serves digital divide and broadband adoption scholars to understand the ways education processes can either reproduce or set the stage to alter entrenched social realities},

abstract = {Like the evaluation of all other information systems initiatives, the evaluation of e-government in both theory and practice has proven to be important and complex. The complexity of evaluation is mostly due to the multiple perspectives involved, the difficulties of quantifying benefits, and the social and technical context of use. The importance of e-government evaluation is due to the enormous investment put in by governments for delivering e-government services and to the considerable pace of growing in the e-government field. However, despite the importance of the evaluation of e-government services, the literature shows that e-government evaluation is still an immature area in terms of development and management. This work is part of a research effort that aims to develop a rigorous and holistic evaluation framework for e-government systems. The main aim of this article is to develop evaluation criteria for an effective, adaptable, and reflective assessment of e-government systems from the citizen's perspective. Developing countries suffer from poor citizen utilization of their e-government initiatives, and the adoption of such criteria would positively contribute in enhancing government understanding of the factors that influence citizen utilization of e-government systems. Moreover, the criteria also can be used as means for providing valuable feedback for the planning of future e-government initiatives. {\textcopyright} 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Governments everywhere must focus on rethinking service delivery as inclusive involvement in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) procedures for smart services has become unavoidable. Metropolitan municipalities in South Africa have joined the technology revolution that embraces smart services delivery through various ICTs and advances the idea of e-governance using the Stakeholder Inclusive Approach. To comprehend how the City of Johannesburg (CoJ) encourages inclusion in smart services, the researchers use an explorative qualitative design that works well with the inclusive stakeholder approach, which supports a collaborative process in ICT adoption. The study discovered through qualitative thematic analysis that inclusiveness is a comprehensive process that considers the demands of different stakeholders in the adoption and implementation of ICT. One issue that leads to ICT efficiencies in the CoJ is data fragmentation from numerous municipal agencies. Inclusionary participation has been widespread in virtual Integrated Development Planning (IDP) forums and other cutting-edge services provided by the CoJ. There have been some exceptional examples of free wifi supply. The study's conclusion reiterates the importance of comprehensive inclusion in ICT adoption and implementation as it links communities with the municipality and stresses the need for city officials to commit to upskilling programmes to improve the delivery of public goods and services delivery.

The two questions that guided the research were: (1) What is the current state of research on the public value of e-government? And (2) What value is e-government supposed to yield? Six, sometimes overlapping, values were found: Improved public services; improved administrative efficiency; Open Government (OG) capabilities; improved ethical behaviour and professionalism; improved trust and confidence in government; and improved social value and well-being. These six public value dimensions were thereafter generalized into three overarching, and also overlapping, public value dimensions of Improved Public Services, Improved Administration, and Improved Social Value. The improved public services dimension influences other dimensions. Hence, this literature study theorizes a descriptive and multidimensional framework that can improve our understanding of the public value of e-government from different viewpoints, and the overlap between them in actual e-government designs and implementations. Regarding the current state of research on the public value this study found a lack of research on the public value of e-government, especially, in the context of developing countries – and more importantly – a total absence of this kind of research in the Least Developed Countries (LDCs). There is also a lack of comparative studies at national, regional, and project level; and a lack of research on the generative perspective.},

abstract = {This paper investigated the significance of e-government services for small businesses in the City of Johannesburg (CoJ). This study employed a qualitative research approach. The primary data for the study were collected through interviews with local government officials and questionnaires with SMMEs. Purposive sampling was used for selecting local government officials, whereas convenience sampling was used to select SMMEs. Data were analyzed using both conceptual and document analysis methods. The study found that e-government was of little significance to SMMEs because it failed to support them in accessing basic, regulatory, financial, market and technical support services under the municipality's local economic development structures. This study recommends an e-government-SMME framework that enhances the use of e-government services to optimize government support to SMMEs. In accordance with this suggested innovation, SMMEs would use e-government to communicate with stakeholders that provide business assistance and regulatory oversight via easy-to-use access application systems (Apps) and general web-based platforms. As a result, their access to finance, technical assistance, market, and regulatory entities would be increased, helping improve the situation when access to these entities is now viewed as difficult. The innovation is premised on the view that e-government may address most challenges faced by SMMEs in South Africa under the presumption that the country has many support systems and structures that fail to support SMMEs because of poor coordination, poor beneficiary engagement, unnecessary bureaucracy, and corruption. The study's findings are significant considering that it brings a new framework that links e-government services to SMME challenges and solutions.},

abstract = {A study conducted by UN Habitat (2020) revealed that financing of investment in African growing cities has become an impediment amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Close to USD 93 billion is needed to finance urban development in Africa. The prevalence of COVID-19 pandemic impacted negatively on the independence of African cities to raise revenue or incur long-term debt to finance their development. Several local governments in African cities are not positioned enough to ensure quality standards of living for their people. This is because many local authorities in African cities cannot intervene in various emergencies or crises which pose a danger to people given the COVID-19 pandemic era where strategic government interventions are essential to save the lives of the people. Burdened by the need to respond to COVID-19, many African governments have diverted their attention from the smart city ideology which demands stable financial revenues and redirected their efforts towards mitigating the scourge of the pandemic. Drawing from this background, therefore this chapter reports on the three selected African cities (Johannesburg, Lagos and Accra) because of their experiences regarding COVID-19, and their responses to the pandemic towards achieving a smart city in Africa. The chapter is guided by the following specific objectives: To examine the unintended consequences of COVID-19 on the achievement of Smart Cities in three African Cities; to assess the opportunities and challenges of achieving smart cities amid COVID 19 in three African Cities; and to determine how rapid urbanisation affects the achievement of Smart Cities amid COVID-19 in three African Cities. Qualitative thematic analysis was used to analyse data acquired from secondary sources.},

A Smart Citizenship approach engages citizens in complementary digitally mediated and face-to-face processes that respect local knowledge systems. We devise a framework for understanding Smart Citizenship and link this to our case study of Transparent Chennai. Our research identifies how information and communication technologies (ICTs) can serve to spotlight overlooked or undervalued urban infrastructural, planning and environmental issues — such as the need for access to safe and clean public toilets; road safety and pro-pedestrian planning. We conclude by suggesting that a locally grounded Smart Citizenship agenda can reprioritize the needs and interests of local communities and neighbourhoods in urban governance, rather than those of exclusivist private commercial interests.},

abstract = {The post-1994 democratic developmental South African state opted for a strong local government system which has been constitutionalised, in terms of Chapter 7 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Act 108 of 1996. The politicisation of the local bureaucracy was inevitable as the ruling party sought to ensure that the executive leadership of municipalities shared the same political ideology and vision to facilitate local development. This raises the question, where does politicisation commence and end, and what is the ideal local political interface for efficient and effective service delivery and, more importantly, to ensure good governance? These questions have to take cognisance of the fact that South Africa is a ‘struggle democracy' and development has to take place in historically disadvantaged areas, where services have been poor or non-existent. The historically advantaged areas have to also be maintained and upgraded, as they are key to financial sustainability of the municipalities. The increasing service delivery protests is a matter for concern, if one has to take cognisance of the popular adage highlighted in official literature, ‘if local government fails, South Arica fails'. Given that the struggles for a democratic South Africa were fought at the grassroots level, this has to translate to an improved quality of life for local communities. Consequently, sound political management is key to enhanced municipal service delivery and ultimately good local governance. This paper reviews political trends and developments up to 2016, but excludes any discussion on the recent local government elections.},

More specifically, this paper aims to provide more insight in the definitions of and relationships between smart governance and concepts such as smart and electronic government, in the context of smart cities. The literature review shows that smart government can be considered as a basis for developing smart governance, through the application of emergent information and communication technologies (ICT) for governing. Smart governance as the intelligent use of ICT to improve decision-making through better collaboration among different stakeholders, including government and citizens, can be strongly related to government approaches. In this case ICT-based tools, such as social media, and openness can be factors that increase citizen engagement and support the development of new governance models for smart government. Smart governance may also have an important role in smart city initiatives, which require complex interactions between governments, citizens and other stakeholders. Based on the literature review, this paper coins a definition of € smart city governance' and contributes to developing a framework for building new, smart governance models addressing the challenges of the digital society, collaborative governance, information sharing, citizen engagement, transparency and openness.},

abstract = {Academic attention to smart cities and their governance is growing rapidly, but the fragmentation in approaches makes for a confusing debate. This article brings some structure to the debate by analyzing a corpus of 51 publications and mapping their variation. The analysis shows that publications differ in their emphasis on (1) smart technology, smart people or smart collaboration as the defining features of smart cities, (2) a transformative or incremental perspective on changes in urban governance, (3) better outcomes or a more open process as the legitimacy claim for smart city governance. We argue for a comprehensive perspective: smart city governance is about crafting new forms of human collaboration through the use of ICTs to obtain better outcomes and more open governance processes. Research into smart city governance could benefit from previous studies into success and failure factors for e-government and build upon sophisticated theories of socio-technical change. This article highlights that smart city governance is not a technological issue: we should study smart city governance as a complex process of institutional change and acknowledge the political nature of appealing visions of socio-technical governance. Points for practitioners: The study provides practitioners with an in-depth understanding of current debates about smart city governance. The article highlights that governing a smart city is about crafting new forms of human collaboration through the use of information and communication technologies. City managers should realize that technology by itself will not make a city smarter: building a smart city requires a political understanding of technology, a process approach to manage the emerging smart city and a focus on both economic gains and other public values.},

Addressing the gap of ICT skills is one of the fundamental options to grow and develop the capacity of people to effectively participate in economic activities. The general objective of this qualitative study was to explore how digital literacy skills can advance the lives of people currently searching for employment. Data were obtained using semi-structured interviews with participants who were not employed and with diverse school backgrounds. The results indicate a need to strengthen existing digital literacy programmes for NEET people. Most of the interviewed NEET people experienced challenges when seeking work on digital platforms, because they are not skilled in digital literacy. Analysis of the data from interview transcripts revealed that there is an array of challenges which prevent NEET people from efficiently using ICTs when searching for work opportunities. These include the high cost of Internet connections and the lack of knowledge of how to use these digital platforms. The study concludes that digital literacy is one of the skills which remains critical for work seekers to increase their chances of achieving continuous work opportunities, and eventually obtain employment or become employers themselves. It is hoped that this study will contribute to the continuous discussions about the lack of digital literacy skills among young people who are economically inactive.},

Focusing on the interstitial spaces existing between consensus and conflict reveals a more relational dynamic that positions consensus and conflict as co-constitutive and continuously being shaped by the performance of politics by state and non-state actors. Critiques of the post-political tend to fail to engage with the conditions that lead to citizen actors acting in political ways beyond the formal processes of planning and decision-making, or when consensus or conflict is used by oppressive politics to produce exclusion and reproduce inequality. In addition to introducing the five papers appearing in this special issue, in this opening editorial, we argue the need to cast attention towards the new expressions of political participation generated by different citizen actors. Critically engaging with these varied expressions may reveal new ways of conceptualising participation that can create new informal spaces where injustices and inequalities are voiced and the structures and hegemonies created are exposed.},

The rapid urbanization and increasing population have put a lot of strains on city infrastructures and service deliveries. The current urbanization requires strong strategies and innovative planning to modernize the urban life. Many cities are enhancing quality and performance of urban services by being digitalized, intelligent and smarter. The policymakers and city authorities are exploring solutions to deliver the new services in an efficient, responsive and sustainable manner for a large population. The study explores all the possible services among various city dimensions which can make a city smart. The ideas related to smart services are collected from the peer vetted creative crowdsourcing process performed online in India. A directed qualitative conventional content analysis is used to analyze the collected ideas. The unique ideas are clustered into 19 different service categories. The findings suggest multi-dimensional service classification along with required basic infrastructural development. Further, the Smart City Transformation Framework (SCTF) is proposed to help the policy makers, urban developers, government officials and service providers in terms of understanding and to draw more insights from the suggested smart solutions for development of smart cities. There are four key areas (Planning, Physical infrastructure, ICT infrastructure and Deploying Smart solutions) discussed in the proposed framework to illustrate the city transformation. The proposed SCTF is supported by literature and examples adopted by various smart cities across the world to illustrate its effectiveness. Moreover, a mind map is designed to illustrate the interrelationships among the collected ideas in an attractive and procedural visualization for city transformation process.},

This study differs significantly from the previous studies in four ways: (i) this study uses a more comprehensive measure of ICT by computing a composite ICT index, which takes into account several ICT indicators; (ii) some existing study uses a narrow proxy of inclusive growth using the Gini index as a proxy, while others consider three patterns of economic growth dynamics (GDP growth, real, and per capita GDP). For robust analysis, we computed a composite inclusive growth index that takes into account several shared growth indicators; (iii) our model captures the heterogeneity effect of the interaction term of FDI and ICT diffusions on two groups of SSA countries, unlike the previous studies that estimated the joint impact of FDI and ICT on the whole group of countries; (iv) we contribute to the extant studies by determining the threshold level at which ICT diffusion may determine the effect of FDI on inclusive growth. Overall, empirical results show that the positive effect of FDI on inclusive growth could intensify when ICT diffusion is beyond a given threshold level, while inflation and vulnerable unemployment deteriorate inclusive growth, among others.

abstract = {This paper identifies individuals' accumulated history with Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) as a replacement for the contested and outdated term ‘digital divide.' We propose that an individual's ability to benefit from their technological history consists of four factors: awareness, knowledge, access, and technological capacity of the user's social collective. Together, these factors make up the individual's level or amount of Technological Capital. The development of this construct was based on empirical research conducted in Soweto, South Africa, and through an analysis of the literature on assessing individuals' accumulated histories. The concept of technological capital has the potential for application in fields in which ICTs are used for communication, capacity building, and identifying barriers to adoption of new technologies. The use of the concept may have implications for policy decisions, resource allocation, and future research into differences among individuals' and communities' ability to benefit from the introduction of new technologies.},

abstract = {The current Covid-19 pandemic has led to the need for more profound research on the digital state in developing nations. As societies aim to adopt technologies, there are critical challenges at hand. The digital divide issue has been luring in modern-day society, particularly the various challenges societies face from harnessing the full benefits that Information and Communication Technology can deliver. Unquestionably, an increase in access to enabling technologies has great potential to close the disparities between social groups. This paper presents the results of a systematic review based on the PRISMA protocol that aims to investigate the digital transforming challenges encountered in rural communities within South Africa. The systematic review was conducted using a comprehensive selection of scientific databases as reference sources, allowing access to several related studies. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined and applied to each retrieved article to choose those that satisfy the current study. From 233 retrieved articles, 32 were included. To further understand the main causes of these challenges, three major problems were identified: socio-economic, technology, and politics. Each of the 32 articles was critically studied to understand their findings before grouping them under any of the identified categories. Based on our findings, we highlighted other key challenges and recommendations to enhance ICT adoption and integration into rural areas in South Africa.},

It harnesses information and communication technologies (ICTs) to transform relationships with citizens and businesses and between the branches of government. The benefits may include reduced corruption, increased transparency, greater convenience, higher revenues, and lower costs. The current E-Government 2.0 describes user-oriented portal services that are integrated into and provided through one portal site using Web 2.0 technologies, such as RSS, blogs, social networks, etc.; and that are accessible from various channels. However, building E-Government 2.0 is difficult because the transition from E-Government to E-Government 2.0 should be an organizational integration agenda, not only a technology one. Agencies may encounter many unpredictable design challenges and tensions that must be managed. Governments are now beginning to focus on the larger and more holistic task of service innovation in order to provide more productive and better services. One of the key observations about making progress with service innovation is that agencies need a framework to help them move forward. Our objective in this study is to propose a novel implementation framework for E-Government 2.0. This framework integrates the processes, resources, back offices, and front offices of online systems to carry out the stakeholder-oriented participatory E-Government 2.0.

In this respect, the focus of the present paper is on the development of an ICT-enabled participatory planning framework for guiding policy-making towards the planning of smart cities. This framework is in alignment with the argument that smart-city solutions must start with the “city” not with the “smart,” shifting from a technology-pushed to an application-pulled smart-city planning approach, matching different types of “smartness” (technologies, tools, and applications) with different types of urban functions and contexts. It is also built upon a digital platform, integrating tools and technologies for data management and e-participatory planning that can support city- and citizen-specific decision making, capable of dealing with objectives for urban sustainability.},

abstract = {The challenge of bringing developing countries into the "information society" has been traditionally framed as bridging the digital divide. Meeting this challenge has predominantly been through technical solutions aimed at providing physical access to the Internet. Yet, other aspects of the divide such as low literacy rates, gender and religious issues arguably pose bigger hurdles in getting the benefits of the Internet to the vast majority of the population of developing countries. They are seldom aware of the information available on the net and even when they are, they have difficulty using it. To facilitate access and use of the Internet by the population, an intermediary is often needed. While case studies in the literature have shown several examples of such intermediaries, the role of this entity has not been conceptually examined. In this paper, we attempt to meet this knowledge gap by conceptualizing the characteristics, types and roles of the Intermediary entity. We present a view from practice through three vignettes of intermediaries from our own studies to illustrate our conceptualizations. Based on this, we discuss some implications for practice and offer directions for research. {\textcopyright} 2012 Copyright Commonwealth Secretariat.},

abstract = {This paper responds to two observations about current government service delivery. First, despite reasonable efforts to improve the design of forms and to establish single points of contact in one-stop shops, citizens still perceive forms as cumbersome. Second, citizens expect governments to act proactively by initiating appropriate government services themselves, instead of relying on requests for services from citizens. To address these two issues, this paper proposes a transition from a one-stop shop to a no-stop shop, where the citizen does not have to perform any action or fill in any forms to receive government services. The contribution of this paper is an e-government stage model that extends existing models. Stage models are suitable tools with which to inspire future developments, and ours extends previous models that guide progress toward the one-stop shop by describing two further stages: the limited no-stop shop and the no-stop shop. We define three dimensions along which to progress: integration of data collection, integration of data storage, and purpose of data use. We provide a first test of the model's validity through three case studies: the e-government practices in Austria, Estonia, and an Australian state government. Our work complements existing research on e-government stage models and proactive government service delivery.},

In this study, we present a new framework for exploring context-specific impacts of ICT capabilities on microeconomic outcomes. The proposed framework is tested within the context of 24 economies that fall into a set of five mutually exclusive economy groups, where group membership is based on a classification scheme of the International Monetary Fund (2011). The results of the data analysis yield (1) a set of context-specific factors that differentiate five economy groups in terms of the microeconomic impact of ICT, and (2) offer insights into specific areas of strength and weakness of each group with regard to the impact.},

This study seeks to shed light on mobile collaborative learning (MCL) by examining the relationships between the learning process (i.e., peer-influenced learning and individual cognitive absorption) and learning impact (i.e., satisfaction, perceived understanding and performance), especially the role of individual learning in groups. The effectiveness of MCL is examined through two types of content delivery, namely video and text. A research framework was proposed that is grounded in learning and cognitive absorption (CA) theories. A set of field experiments was designed and conducted with 1131 secondary students (347 groups) to understand the MCL process and learning impact with mobile tablets in both individual and group settings. Significant differences were found between content delivery types in both individual and group learning modes in regard to how the learning process influences learning impact. Moreover, performance and satisfaction with texts is higher with mobile groups, while videos are more influential for individual learning. Lastly, the study implications and future research directions are discussed.},

The purpose of this research is to explore direct and indirect effects of trust in online services on the satisfaction of the e-Government service users and other perceptions such as e-G2B system effectiveness and the operational effectiveness of organizations. Based on a sample of e-G2B service users from Saudi Arabia, our preliminary findings suggest that the effects of trust on user satisfaction are mediated by e-G2B system effectiveness measures (e.g., System Quality, Service Quality, and Information Quality) and by operational effectiveness. In addition, we find that operational effectiveness and information quality are the most important drivers of user satisfaction. In contrast to previous research, our results show a negative relationship between trust in online services and service quality and suggest that this finding may have important implications for theory and practice.},

abstract = {We have identified a paradox in the still low adoption of e-government after more than two decades of policy efforts and public investments for the deployment of online public services. Using as evidence the focus and evolution of this focus over the period 1994-2013 in a vast body of literature produced by academia, international organisations and practitioners, we show that: a) the deployment of e-government was for a long time concentrated on more technological and operational matters and that only more recently attention switched to broadly defined institutional and political issues (hypothesis 1a); and b) institutional and political barriers are one of the main factors explaining lack of e-government adoption (hypothesis 1b). A decision making process that is still unstructured, untrustworthy, and not fully leveraging the available evidence hinder the perception of public value and citizens' trust in government, which contribute to low level of e-government adoption. We conclude suggesting that a smart government producing public value is grounded in a triangle of good decision defined by politics, values, and evidence and that to achieve it public sector should go beyond the traditional concept of service innovation. It should rather introduce conceptual and systemic innovation pertaining to a new way of thinking and of interacting with stakeholders and citizens as sources of both legitimacy and evidence. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

E-government use in these societies may differ by ethnic background, size of locality or both. Israel was chosen as a case since it is an example of a deeply divided society. Using data from the Israel's Social Survey 2015, it was found that the disadvantaged minority has a lower probability of using e-government as compared to other groups. However, when segmenting this population by size of its localities, the stratification structure differs between large and small localities. The conclusion is that the inequality approaches should consider not only the ethnicity but also the size of locality as a factor differentiating between ethnic groups in terms of the specific Internet use.},

Advances like SPPnet [1] and Fast R-CNN [2] have reduced the running time of these detection networks, exposing region proposal computation as a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce a Region Proposal Network (RPN) that shares full-image convolutional features with the detection network, thus enabling nearly cost-free region proposals. An RPN is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The RPN is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-CNN for detection. We further merge RPN and Fast R-CNN into a single network by sharing their convolutional features - using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the RPN component tells the unified network where to look. For the very deep VGG-16 model [3], our detection system has a frame rate of 5 fps (including all steps) on a GPU, while achieving state-of-the-art object detection accuracy on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012, and MS COCO datasets with only 300 proposals per image. In ILSVRC and COCO 2015 competitions, Faster R-CNN and RPN are the foundations of the 1st-place winning entries in several tracks. Code has been made publicly available.},

Infrastructural deficiencies, especially in digital infrastructure and AI adoption, add to these challenges. Therefore, exploring digital technologies and AI is essential for developing smart, sustainable cities in the Global South. This paper examined both the potential and barriers to digital technologies and AI. It also explored policy implications and proposes a framework for smart sustainable cities. A qualitative methodological approach is used, including a systematic literature review and case studies. The study demonstrates how various urban challenges can be addressed with digital technologies and AI, alongside the barriers to their adoption. The study proposes a conceptual framework with three key pillars: adopting digital technologies and AI as the pivotal element, overcoming barriers, and identifying application areas to transform cities into smart sustainable cities. Moreover, the paper discusses policy implications and suggests future directions for research.},

abstract = {Rapid urbanization has brought about great challenges to our daily lives, such as traffic congestion, environmental pollution, energy consumption, public safety, and so on. Research on smart cities aims to address these issues with various technologies developed for the Internet of Things. Very recently, the research focus has shifted toward processing of massive amount of data continuously generated within a city environment, e.g., physical and participatory sensing data on traffic flow, air quality, and health care. Techniques from computational intelligence have been applied to process and analyze such data, and to extract useful knowledge that helps citizens better understand their surroundings and informs city authorities to provide better and more efficient public services. Deep learning, as a relatively new paradigm in computational intelligence, has attracted substantial attention of the research community and demonstrated greater potential over traditional techniques. This paper provides a survey of the latest research on the convergence of deep learning and smart city from two perspectives: while the technique-oriented review pays attention to the popular and extended deep learning models, the application-oriented review emphasises the representative application domains in smart cities. Our study showed that there are still many challenges ahead for this emerging area owing to the complex nature of deep learning and wide coverage of smart city applications. We pointed out a number of future directions related to deep learning efficiency, emergent deep learning paradigms, knowledge fusion and privacy preservation, and hope these would move the relevant research one step further in creating truly distributed intelligence for smart cities.},

The main objectives are to explore if the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning can improve citizens' experience of digital citizen participation platforms. Taking as a case study the "Decide Madrid"Consul platform, which enables citizens to post proposals for policies they would like to see adopted by the city council, we used NLP and machine learning to provide new ways to (a) suggest to citizens proposals they might wish to support; (b) group citizens by interests so that they can more easily interact with each other; (c) summarise comments posted in response to proposals; and (d) assist citizens in aggregating and developing proposals. Evaluation of the results confirms that NLP and machine learning have a role to play in addressing some of the barriers users of platforms such as Consul currently experience.

PdM is a prominent strategy for dealing with maintenance issues given the increasing need to minimize downtime and associated costs. One of the challenges with PdM is generating the so-called "health factors," or quantitative indicators, of the status of a system associated with a given maintenance issue, and determining their relationship to operating costs and failure risk. The proposed PdM methodology allows dynamical decision rules to be adopted for maintenance management, and can be used with high-dimensional and censored data problems. This is achieved by training multiple classification modules with different prediction horizons to provide different performance tradeoffs in terms of frequency of unexpected breaks and unexploited lifetime, and then employing this information in an operating cost-based maintenance decision system to minimize expected costs. The effectiveness of the methodology is demonstrated using a simulated example and a benchmark semiconductor manufacturing maintenance problem.},

This novel approach has been applied to process reviews of primary care practices in England. Findings from an analysis of more than 200,000 reviews show that the quality of interactions with staff and bureaucratic exigencies are the key drivers of user satisfaction.

abstract = {The development of smart cities and their fast-paced deployment is resulting in the generation of large quantities of data at unprecedented rates. Unfortunately, most of the generated data is wasted without extracting potentially useful information and knowledge because of the lack of established mechanisms and standards that benefit from the availability of such data. Moreover, the highly dynamic nature of smart cities calls for a new generation of machine learning approaches that are flexible and adaptable to cope with the dynamicity of data to perform analytics and learn from real-Time data. In this article, we shed light on the challenge of underutilizing the big data generated by smart cities from a machine learning perspective. In particular, we present the phenomenon of wasting unlabeled data. We argue that semi-supervision is a must for smart cities to address this challenge. We also propose a three-level learning framework for smart cities that matches the hierarchical nature of big data generated by smart cities with a goal of providing different levels of knowledge abstraction. The proposed framework is scalable to meet the needs of smart city services. Fundamentally, the framework benefits from semi-supervised deep reinforcement learning where a small amount of data that has users' feedback serves as labeled data, while a larger amount without such users' feedback serves as unlabeled data. The framework utilizes a mix of labeled and unlabeled data to converge toward better control policies instead of wasting the unlabeled data. This article also explores how deep reinforcement learning and its shift toward semi-supervision can handle the cognitive side of smart city services and improve their performance by providing several use cases spanning the different domains of smart cities. We also highlight several challenges as well as promising future research directions for incorporating machine learning and high-level intelligence into smart city services.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous sensing enabled by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across many areas of modern day living. This offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments. The proliferation of these devices in a communicating-actuating network creates the Internet of Things (IoT), wherein sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fueled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling wireless technologies such as RFID tags and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, the IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is the next revolutionary technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need for data-on-demand using sophisticated intuitive queries increases significantly. This paper presents a Cloud centric vision for worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT research in the near future are discussed. A Cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public Clouds is presented. We conclude our IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of WSN, the Internet and distributed computing directed at technological research community. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In recent years, the city of Kigali in Rwanda has faced increasing traffic congestion, especially during rush hours, it leads to vehicles being parked along the roads and cause the traffic jams. The manual management of the parking in such conditions is cumbersome. This research begins by reviewing IoT applications in parking management and closely examining the current IoT-enabled parking systems in Kigali. These systems are manually monitored by the parking spaces managers. However, there are very few parking spaces which have automatic entrance and exit gates without monitoring the parking occupancy status. This study stats by highlighting both strengths and limitations of existing systems in parking management and proposes an improved innovative solution that employs vehicle detection sensors, real-time parking guidance, availability monitoring, and data analytics to optimize parking space allocation. This system will reduce congestion and improve urban mobility through integration of innovative technologies, user-friendly mobile apps, and sustainable policies to enhance IoT applications in Kigali's car parking spaces. The proposed solution potentially informs and inspires further scientific research and practical to embrace IoT implementations in cities parking spaces around the world.},

To achieve a smooth and effective transition to SSC, policies and delivery mechanisms should be put in place, and the readiness of both the government and the society should be assessed. This study focuses on digital participatory planning (DPP) as a precondition for social sustainability in SSC and aims to summarise and assess the current relevant local policies and endeavours in Oman; and to develop a generic framework to evaluate the readiness for DPP. In doing so, selective key literature, policies and initiatives were critically reviewed covering the SSC concept, establishing the link between the SSC and DPP, and eliciting a list of comprehensive DPP readiness factors. The results indicated that the Omani government has a clear will to move towards SSC and the country has already witnessed few initiatives supporting this direction. However, there is a lack of a clear action plan regarding DPP. Therefore, more work is required to systemise efforts. The study provides a generic framework to assess the readiness of the government and society for DPP and concludes with recommendations for policymakers.},

abstract = {Urban performance currently depends not only on a city's endowment of hard infrastructure (physical capital), but also, and increasingly so, on the availability and quality of knowledge communication and social infrastructure (human and social capital). The latter form of capital is decisive for urban competitiveness. Against this background, the concept of the "smart city" has recently been introduced as a strategic device to encompass modern urban production factors in a common framework and, in particular, to highlight the importance of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in the last 20 years for enhancing the competitive profile of a city. The present paper aims to shed light on the often elusive definition of the concept of the "smart city." We provide a focused and operational definition of this construct and present consistent evidence on the geography of smart cities in the EU27. Our statistical and graphical analyses exploit in depth, for the first time to our knowledge, the most recent version of the Urban Audit data set in order to analyze the factors determining the performance of smart cities. We find that the presence of a creative class, the quality of and dedicated attention to the urban environment, the level of education, and the accessibility to and use of ICTs for public administration are all positively correlated with urban wealth. This result prompts the formulation of a new strategic agenda for European cities that will allow them to achieve sustainable urban development and a better urban landscape. {\textcopyright} 2011 by The Society of Urban Technology.},

This article investigates the impact of AI on carbon emissions, distinguishing between applied and innovative AI types. Analyzing data from 267 Chinese cities between 2008 and 2019, the study reveals that applied AI reduces carbon dioxide emissions by an average of 40,100 tons per unit increase. In contrast, innovative AI initially leads to emissions increases before ultimately decreasing, illustrating an inverted U-shaped relationship. Regional variations in AI's impact on emissions are influenced by each region's developmental focus and stage of AI deployment. Specifically, differences arise due to the continuous carbon reduction (-0.024) associated with applied AI and the initial emission increase (0.129) attributed to innovative AI. The study underscores the significance of tailored regional strategies in AI development for fostering sustainable smart cities. These findings contribute to the ongoing discourse on AI's environmental impact, offering insights to inform targeted approaches in green, sustainable urban planning.},

abstract = {Highlights • The modelling of real-world systems in the field of automatic control is necessary for multiple objectives, including process simulation, control system design, and optimization of numerous processes. • The process of AI-based models development can be divided into four stages: structure or architecture design, training, validation and use. • There are many models basing on artificial neural networks and machine learning, which were applied in different configurations to solve specific technological problems. • Multi-layered perceptron networks with backpropagation training (the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm) seem to be most frequently used model for training and short-time predictions. • For optimization of processes, machine learning algorithms should be rather applied. Abstract: Environmental monitoring systems play a crucial role in assessing environmental quality, detecting limits exceedances, and predicting potential ecological episodes. These systems rely on the measurement of various variables at specific locations and time intervals over an extended period. The concept of environmental monitoring encompasses the assessment of health and safety issues for public and environmental health purposes. Pollution of the atmosphere and water, climate change, and natural disasters are among the consequences of continuous industrial and municipal development and human interference in natural ecosystems. To address these challenges and to protect human lives and the environment, with a special concern on mitigating the ecological effects of industrial development, advanced technical solutions, including the technologies associated with artificial intelligence (artificial neural networks ANNs, machine learning ML) have been developed. These technologies offer powerful tools for analysing the vast amount of data collected by monitoring systems and extracting valuable insights. By applying ANNs and machine learning algorithms, environmental monitoring systems can effectively process and interpret the measured variables to assess environmental quality. Despite challenges and limitations, such as data quality and interpretability of AI models, ongoing research and interdisciplinary collaboration are paving the way for the successful implementation of AI in environmental monitoring, ultimately supporting informed decision-making and sustainable resource management. While several review papers have explored the theory of artificial intelligence (AI), here I aim to review the application of ANNs and ML, in environmental aspects, specifically in automotive and industrial emissions toxicity measurements, as well as atmospheric pollution prevention. By examining the potential of AI in these domains, the paper contributes to understanding the role of advanced technologies in environmental monitoring and protection.},

abstract = {The rapid increase in human activities is causing significant damage to our planet's ecosystems, necessitating innovative solutions to preserve biodiversity and counteract ecological threats. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force, providing unparalleled capabilities for environmental monitoring and conservation. This research paper explores the applications of AI in ecosystem management, including wildlife tracking, habitat assessment, biodiversity analysis, and natural disaster prediction. AI's role in environmental monitoring and conservation includes wildlife tracking, habitat assessment, resource conservation, biodiversity analysis, and species identification. AI algorithms analyze camera trap footage, drone imagery, and GPS data to identify and estimate population sizes, leading to improved anti-poaching efforts and enhanced protection of diverse species. Habitat assessment and resource conservation involve AI-powered image analysis, which aids in assessing forest health, detecting deforestation, and identifying areas in need of restoration. Biodiversity analysis and species identification are achieved through AI algorithms that analyze acoustic recordings, environmental DNA (eDNA), and camera trap footage. These innovations identify different species, assess biodiversity levels, and even discover new or endangered species. AI-powered flood prediction systems provide early warnings, empowering communities with better preparedness and evacuation efforts. Challenges, such as data quality and availability, algorithmic bias, and infrastructure limitations, are acknowledged as opportunities for growth and improvement. In policy and regulation, the paper advocates for clear frameworks prioritizing data privacy and security, algorithmic transparency, and equitable access. Responsible development and ethical use of AI are emphasized as foundational pillars, ensuring that the integration of AI into environmental conservation aligns with principles of fairness, transparency, and societal benefit.},

abstract = {The enormous increase in the volume of waste caused by the population boom in cities is placing a considerable burden on waste processing in cities. The inefficiency and high costs of conventional approaches exacerbate the risks to the environment and human health. This article proposes a thorough approach that combines deep learning models, IoT technologies, and easily accessible resources to overcome these challenges. Our main goal is to advance a framework for intelligent waste processing that utilizes Internet of Things sensors and deep learning algorithms. The proposed framework is based on Raspberry Pi 4 with a camera module and TensorFlow Lite version 2.13. and enables the classification and categorization of trash in real time. When trash objects are identified, a servo motor mounted on a plastic plate ensures that the trash is sorted into appropriate compartments based on the model's classification. This strategy aims to reduce overall health risks in urban areas by improving waste sorting techniques, monitoring the condition of garbage cans, and promoting sanitation through efficient waste separation. By streamlining waste handling processes and enabling the creation of recyclable materials, this framework contributes to a more sustainable waste management system.},

@article{Bhatia2024,
abstract = {Prior research has primarily concentrated on non-digital and process-oriented methods for achieving carbon neutrality (CN) in the context of mitigating climate change (CC), while the potential of digital technology (DT) has hardly been investigated. This study addresses this gap by answering four research questions: How are firms utilizing DT to achieve CN? What drives the adoption of DT for achieving CN? What are the barriers that prevent the adoption of DT for achieving CN? What risk mitigation strategies can be adopted by firms to overcome these barriers? An inductive method using open-ended essays has been adopted to gather data from firms that have already implemented DT for CN. The findings revealed four distinct dimensions. Utilization of DT for CN includes enhancing business value, managing one's carbon footprint, enabling smart solutions, and enhancing efficiency. The drivers for adopting DT for CN included driving business growth, external pressures, competitive advantage, and environmental consciousness. Key barriers included financial barriers, technological barriers, human resource barriers, and external barriers. Risk mitigation strategies included pre-implementation strategies, detailed planning and evaluation, ensuring employees' buy-in and readiness, and external stakeholder engagement. This study offers a broad-based foundation for designing DT strategies for achieving CN.},

abstract = {China's economy is stepping into a new stage of high-quality development. The shift not only marks the optimization and upgrading of the economic structure, but also reflects the in-depth implementation of the concept of sustainable development. In this context, the development of AI technology is playing an important role in balancing economic growth and ecological protection with its unique advantages. This paper empirically studied the impact of AI development on urban energy efficiency by constructing panel data for 282 prefecture-level cities from 2006 to 2019 and then using the super-efficiency SBM model based on non-expected outputs to evaluate the urban energy efficiency indicators of prefecture-level cities. It was discovered that the development of AI had a key influence on increasing urban energy efficiency and the optimization of the energy structure by speeding up green technology innovation and digital economy development, which in turn improved urban energy efficiency. In terms of heterogeneity analysis, AI development had a greater impact on urban energy efficiency in the eastern region, which has higher levels of human capital, financial independence, and government intervention. This study combined the smart city pilot policy with a multi-period DID model, based on the treatment of endogeneity issues, in order to perform a parallel trend test and investigate further the effects of policy implementation on the advancement of AI in the context of improving urban energy efficiency. Accordingly, to achieve green and sustainable urban development, the relevant government departments should increase funding for AI research and development, pay attention to the introduction and cultivation of professionals, establish a platform for international exchanges and cooperation between AI and energy management, and continue to advocate for the pilot development of smart cities to increase urban energy efficiency.},

This study analyzes the role played by Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy trading in system operation. Several case studies with four distinct prosumer models, each fitted with diverse Energy Storage Systems (ESS), photovoltaic (PV) systems, and responsive demand technologies such as Electric Vehicles (EV), are examined. An economic analysis is conducted using the developed interface. An energy management system establishes a dynamic market framework, enabling energy trading via P2P market operators and distribution system operators. The implemented trading platform is chosen depending on pricing variations across different time intervals for home models. The P2P energy trading system employs mathematical modeling via deep learning to achieve an optimal solution that minimizes costs. The study uses other domestic models and optimization techniques to explore the amount of energy traded across households and timeframes. Additionally, it investigates the accomplishment of two-way energy transfer in electric cars, the importance of energy storage and photovoltaic systems, and various housing scenarios concerning peer-to-peer energy trading. Additionally, the system's advantages are demonstrated to participants beforehand by validating and presenting data through an input and output system that accepts these instances.},

abstract = {Waste management is one of the biggest problems facing the world in any developed or developing country. An important aspect of waste management is that the waste bin in the open space is properly filled before the next cleaning process begins. This can eventually lead to various hazards such as dirt and bad odor in the area, which can lead to the spread of various diseases. Population growth has significantly reduced toilets through the waste management system. Laying garbage in public places creates a polluted environment. To eliminate or reduce waste and maintain good hygiene, it requires a waste-based waste management system. The need for proper waste management is not limited to proper collection and disposal of waste. It continues to be a waste disposal and recyclable level. Recycling is considered a major benefit because in addition to waste disposal, our reliance on immature materials is declining. By recycling metal, plastic and glass, the use of decomposing waste can extend beyond compost and manure. Metals can be reused and plastic can be mixed with clay filler, which can lead to soil compaction. After deep cleaning the glass construction material can be broken down and re-melted into new articles. This article is about machine learning and the use of artificial intelligence in the most viable areas and understanding the full need for human communication.},

abstract = {Billions of packages are automatically handled in warehouses every year. The gripping systems are, however, most often oversized in order to cover a large range of different carton types, package masses, and robot motions. In addition, a targeted optimization of the process parameters with the aim of reducing the oversizing requires prior knowledge, personnel resources, and experience. This paper investigates whether the energy-efficiency in vacuum-based package handling can be increased without the need for prior knowledge of optimal process parameters. The core method comprises the variation of the input pressure for the vacuum ejector, compliant to the robot trajectory and the resulting inertial forces at the gripper-object-interface. The control mechanism is trained by applying reinforcement learning with a deep Q-agent. In the proposed use case, the energy-efficiency can be increased by up to 70% within a few hours of learning. It is also demonstrated that the generalization capability with regard to multiple different robot trajectories is achievable. In the future, the industrial applicability can be enhanced by deployment of the deep Q-agent in a decentral system, to collect data from different pick and place processes and enable a generalizable and scalable solution for energy-efficient vacuum-based handling in warehouse automation.},

abstract = {Financial fraud is an issue with far reaching consequences in the finance industry, government, corporate sectors, and for ordinary consumers. Increasing dependence on new technologies such as cloud and mobile computing in recent years has compounded the problem. Traditional methods involving manual detection are not only time consuming, expensive and inaccurate, but in the age of big data they are also impractical. Not surprisingly, financial institutions have turned to automated processes using statistical and computational methods. This paper presents a comprehensive review of financial fraud detection research using such data mining methods, with a particular focus on computational intelligence (CI)-based techniques. Over fifty scientific literature, primarily spanning the period 2004-2014, were analysed in this study; literature that reported empirical studies focussing specifically on CI-based financial fraud detection were considered in particular. Research gap was identified as none of the existing review articles addresses the association among fraud types, CI-based detection algorithms and their performance, as reported in the literature. We have presented a comprehensive classification as well as analysis of existing fraud detection literature based on key aspects such as detection algorithm used, fraud type investigated, and performance of the detection methods for specific financial fraud types. Some of the key issues and challenges associated with the current practices and potential future direction of research have also been identified.},

abstract = {The objective of this study is to provide a better understanding of the potential of using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve Public Transport (PT), by reviewing research literature. The selection process resulted in 87 scientific publications constituting a sample of how AI has been applied to improve PT. The review shows that the primary aims of using AI are to improve the service quality or to better understand traveller behaviour. Train and bus are the dominant modes of transport investigated. Furthermore, AI is mainly used for three tasks; the most frequent one is prediction, followed by an estimation of the current state, and resource allocation, including planning and scheduling. Only two studies concern automation; all the others provide different kinds of decision support for travellers, PT operators, PT planners, or municipalities. Most of the reviewed AI solutions require significant amounts of data related to the travellers and the PT system. Machine learning is the most frequently used AI technology, with some studies applying reasoning or heuristic search techniques. We conclude that there still remains a great potential of using AI to improve PT waiting to be explored, but that there are also some challenges that need to be considered. They are often related to data, e.g., that large datasets of high quality are needed, that substantial resources and time are needed to pre-process the data, or that the data compromise personal privacy. Further research is needed about how to handle these issues efficiently.},

abstract = {Smart information systems (Big Data and artificial intelligence) are used by governments to improve mobility, reduce over-crowdedness in hotspots, and provide more effective management of crowds. I looked at how Amsterdam municipality is using smart information systems (SIS) in their DrukteRadar Project to identify, report, and tackle issues surrounding crowdedness levels in the city. 
 SIS are becoming popular amongst governmental officials to automate activities more effectively. SIS provide the opportunity to improve mobility, increase economic growth, reduce energy outputs, improve management decisions, respond to disasters quicker, and improve citizens' quality of life. They offer governments the possibility of improving services, while reducing costs. The use and implementation of SIS is becoming widespread and governments are observing the benefits posed by SIS, particularly in relation to urban management.  
 80% of Europe's population will live in cities by 2020 and governments face a huge strain on resources and infrastructure. The use of SIS is being pioneered to help governments meet these needs and to provide a sustainable future for urban citizens. Ethical issues in this context can include that data may not be accurate, faithful or representative of a city and its citizens, which may cause bias, prejudice and harm to a population, by leading to unfair service provision. ICT companies' involvement in governmental SIS projects may also lead to technological lock-in and dependency on corporations. Instantaneous and ubiquitous retrieval and analysis of data may infringe upon citizens' privacy and may lead vulnerabilities of malicious hacking, stolen data and a city's security.
 To uncover if these issues correlate with the experience of those working in the field, I interviewed the Project Owner of Amsterdam's DrukteRadar project (translated as crowdedness project). This project implements SIS to anticipate and prevent overcrowding in Amsterdam, and was created in response to growing pressures on the city's amenities. The DrukteRadar Project collates a wide array of datasets to predict crowd levels and potential problem hotspots, visualised through a digital dashboard. The project aims to improve municipality management, provide help to tourists planning their trips, and assisting citizens' navigation through the city.
 Through my discussions with the Project Owner of the DrukteRadar, I uncovered two additional issues not found in the literature: access to SIS and data ownership. The DrukteRadar team is concerned about access to SIS to promote fairness, equality, and provision of services amongst citizens. It aims to make its dashboard user-friendly and available to as many people as possible to promote inclusion. Data ownership is a concern for the project – who owns the data and what can be done with it. The DrukteRadar Project ensures they have data sovereignty, so that they do not become technologically locked-in to relationships with private organisations. 
 The Project Owner was aware that inaccurate of data may lead to discriminatory recommendations and harmful consequences. The DrukteRadar Project tries to minimise their algorithmic inaccuracy through extensive monitoring; secure technical infrastructure; and stakeholder review sessions. Another interesting finding was identifying how projects ensure privacy protection of its citizens. The DrukteRadar ensures that data is not traceable to individuals and the use of datasets follow privacy-by-design principles. The project also has strong security protocols, cyber-security measures, anonymization techniques, and repeated vulnerability tests. Overall, my report was able to evaluate how ethical issues found within the SIS literature correlate to those identified, and tackled, in practice. as well as highlighting the two additional concerns not explicitly mentioned in the literature.},

We employ the fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) method. Our analyses indicate that (1) multiple factors impact both high entrepreneurial activity and non-high entrepreneurial activity; entrepreneurial activity is significantly different between advanced and catching-up regions; (2) there are two types of paths that lead to high entrepreneurial activity, namely technology driven and technology–institution driven. These paths are dynamic, gradually transitioning from technology driven and technology–institution driven to industry–resource driven; and (3) non-high entrepreneurial activity may result from poor technological infrastructure and lack of human capital. These findings elucidate the different routes through which entrepreneurial activity is generated in China and offer valuable theoretical and practical insights.},

abstract = {Grounded in the innovation diffusion literature and the resource-based theory, this paper develops an integrative research model for assessing the diffusion and consequence of e-business at the firm level. Unlike the typical focus on adoption as found in the literature, we focus on postadoption stages, that is, actual usage and value creation. The model thus moves beyond dichotomous "adoption versus nonadoption" and accounts for the "missing link" - actual usage - as a critical stage of value creation. The model links technological, organizational, and environmental factors to e-business use and value, based on which a series of hypotheses are developed. The theoretical model is tested by using structural equation modeling on a dataset of 624 firms across 10 countries in the retail industry. To probe deeper into whether e-business use and value are influenced by economic environments, two subsamples from developed and developing countries are compared. The study finds that technology competence, firm size, financial commitment, competitive pressure, and regulatory support are important antecedents of e-business use. In addition, the study finds that, while both front-end and back-end capabilities contribute to e-business value, back-end integration has a much stronger impact. While front-end functionalities are becoming commodities, e-businesses are more differentiated by back-end integration. This is consistent with the resource-based theory because back-end integration possesses the value-creating characteristics of resources (e.g., firm specific, difficult to imitate), which are strengthened by the Internet-enabled connectivity. Our study also adds an international dimension to the innovation diffusion literature, showing that careful attention must be paid to the economic and regulatory factors that may affect technology diffusion across different countries. {\textcopyright} 2005 INFORMS.},

abstract = {Guided by the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework, the current study aims to test the impacts of organizational factors, technological factors, and environmental factors on the financial and non-financial performance (or goals) of hospitality firms. Unlike several empirical studies in the past, this study attempted to compare the effects of these factors on financial and non-financial performances. The authors proposed the contributions with clearer and more specific recommendations and a greater understanding of how managers can improve and adjust their strategic plan and implementation to achieve long-term firm performance. The data analysis was structural equation modeling. Prior to the data analysis, reliability and validity tests were conducted to certify the quality of the data. After screening the data carefully, based on 350 hospitality firms in Thailand, including 3–5-star hotels in Thailand representing all parts of the country, the results indicated that organizational factors and technological factors had significant effects on both financial and non-financial performance. The environmental factor demonstrated no significant effect on financial and non-financial performance. Moreover, for the theoretical contribution, this study provided empirical research by applying the TOE framework in the context of the hospitality industry, presenting that organizational factors and technological factors had significant impacts on the firm performance. Discussion with the past literature provided deeper insights into the findings. Research conclusions and practical recommendations were also provided.},

abstract = {This study investigates the factors involved in digital marketing adoption among small and medium startups (SMSs) in Pakistan using the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework. Data were collected through an online survey from 409 startups based in Karachi, Pakistan, and structural equation modeling (SEM) was used for analysis. Results indicate SMSs prioritize internal capabilities and resources for digital marketing adoption over external factors. Key factors identified in digital marketing adoption include technology knowledge, compatibility and cost while the effect of technology complexity was found to be insignificant. Top management support and digital marketing orientation were also crucial, highlighting the importance of strategic leadership and a focused digital approach. These findings highlight the distinct characteristics of SMSs compared to established SMEs, providing insights for developing targeted strategies and regulations to support the startup ecosystem. The research contributes to understanding the unique challenges and factors influencing digital marketing adoption in startups, paving the way for better and effective support mechanisms.},

abstract = {This paper aims to engage with the ongoing debates on the role of planning in future smart cities, to make a case for a reconceptualization of the technocentric notion of the smart city, and to elevate the position of city planning within the smart-city discourse. The central argument made is that the smart city could exploit the synergies between city planning and three techno-scientific domains including Big Data, Geographic Information Science and Systems, and Data Science—which collectively constitute an emerging field known as Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI)— to meet four overarching policy goals: 1) to enhance the efficiency of urban services and functions; 2) to improve quality of life for all urban citizens; 3) to address the pressing societal, ecological and economic challenges that could plague urban systems on different levels; and, 4) to contribute to the production of spatial data, information and knowledge on human-urban dynamics. In addition, the paper defines a human-centered conceptual framework illustrating how the cross-pollination between city planning and the three techno-scientific fields could enhance the planning practice and accomplish the smart-city policy goals. The methodology employed in this study entails a systematic review of the literature. In addition to discussing the latest achievements as well as the progress made on the nexus of city planning and GeoAI, the paper also highlights the barriers to the application of GeoAI in the planning, design and management of smart cities and identifies potential avenues for future research.},

abstract = {The Global South (GS) refers to a block of countries in the process of rapidly catching up with the industrialization of their economies. GS countries are trying to leverage their growing demand for innovative products and services to negotiate the uptake of novel technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI). The latter can help such countries further stimulate their economic growth and become influential in dictating policies that could advance global development. However, a misaligned AI-adoption strategy entails the risk of alienating the social, economic, and even cultural requirements of such countries, ultimately leading to the incorporation of technologies not serving the needs of their users. Subsequently, we conduct a study whose goal is to provide guidelines on how to perform a comprehensive analysis of the AI ecosystems in GS countries, to determine their readiness to adopt and utilize beneficially these technologies. For this, we performed a qualitative case study of two GS countries, namely Senegal and Cambodia. The depiction of their AI ecosystems unveiled the need to stimulate their societies (i.e., by media exposure, education, etc.) in discerning the practical effects of AI. However, an impactful AI implementation requires a reciprocated satisfaction of the needs of multiple contributing actors. Finally, particular recommendations are offered at the level of these countries' academic, industrial, and governmental constitutions, suggesting to focalize their resources in order to better energize (and optimally disperse) their research and entrepreneurial capabilities that could help identify the ways in which AI solutions can be of added-value within the premises of these two countries.},

@article{Moriarty2023,
abstract = {A vast literature now exists on how modern communication and computational technologies (CCTs)—such as artificial intelligence and big data, and their use in smart grids, smart cities, smart health, and energy demand management—can help overcome both the environmental and socio-economic challenges cities (especially large ones) presently face. Smart grids, for example, promise to allow greater percentages of intermittent renewable energy in the grid, particularly the rapidly increasing supplies of wind and solar energy, and to help match electricity production to demand. There are many potential advantages possible with advanced CCT, but they need careful implementation because many potential problems can also occur. This review first examines what is needed to produce ecologically sustainable and more equitable cities. A critical aspect of this is the need for a global Earth Systems Science approach to include the environmental damages caused elsewhere by a given city. It then examines how the new CCT can potentially help achieve these aims. An important conclusion is that, in most cases, advanced technology availability is insufficient; strong policies are also needed. The shortcomings of actually implemented or proposed approaches are also examined. Finally, it discusses what future decades might bring and the implications for the new CCTs.},

Despite the expected benefits, the adoption of AI varies from one smart city to another, due in part to barriers that can inhibit a smart city from adopting AI. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive view of the barriers faced by smart cities. Through a systematic literature review, this study identifies 18 primary and secondary barriers grouped into three main categories — technology, environment, and organization. This research contributes to the literature by developing a typology of AI adoption barriers based on the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) perspective. The typology provides a novel mapping of the barriers to AI adoption faced by smart cities and suggests directions for further investigation through a cohesive research agenda. At a practical level, the findings will allow policymakers, planners, and citizens to make more informed decisions about AI adoption. Practical implications are also proposed for guiding smart cities to increase the adoption of AI.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the key components of the ICT infrastructure of smart sustainable cities as an emerging urban development approach due to its great potential to advance environmental sustainability. As one of the prevalent ICT visions or computing paradigms, the IoT is associated with big data analytics, which is clearly on a penetrative path across many urban domains for optimizing energy efficiency and mitigating environmental effects. This pertains mainly to the effective utilization of natural resources, the intelligent management of infrastructures and facilities, and the enhanced delivery of services in support of the environment. As such, the IoT and related big data applications can play a key role in catalyzing and improving the process of environmentally sustainable development. However, topical studies tend to deal largely with the IoT and related big data applications in connection with economic growth and the quality of life in the realm of smart cities, and largely ignore their role in improving environmental sustainability in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. In addition, several advanced technologies are being used in smart cities without making any contribution to environmental sustainability, and the strategies through which sustainable cities can be achieved fall short in considering advanced technologies. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to review and synthesize the relevant literature with the objective of identifying and discussing the state-of-the-art sensor-based big data applications enabled by the IoT for environmental sustainability and related data processing platforms and computing models in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. Also, this paper identifies the key challenges pertaining to the IoT and big data analytics, as well as discusses some of the associated open issues. Furthermore, it explores the opportunity of augmenting the informational landscape of smart sustainable cities with big data applications to achieve the required level of environmental sustainability. In doing so, it proposes a framework which brings together a large number of previous studies on smart cities and sustainable cities, including research directed at a more conceptual, analytical, and overarching level, as well as research on specific technologies and their novel applications. The goal of this study suits a mix of two research approaches: topical literature review and thematic analysis. In terms of originality, no study has been conducted on the IoT and related big data applications in the context of smart sustainable cities, and this paper provides a basis for urban researchers to draw on this analytical framework in future research. The proposed framework, which can be replicated, tested, and evaluated in empirical research, will add additional depth to studies in the field of smart sustainable cities. This paper serves to inform urban planners, scholars, ICT experts, and other city stakeholders about the environmental benefits that can be gained from implementing smart sustainable city initiatives and projects on the basis of the IoT and related big data applications.},

abstract = {Sustainable cities are currently undergoing unprecedented transformative changes in light of the recent paradigm shift in science and technology brought on by big data science and analytics. These marked changes are motivated by the increased need to tackle the problematicity surrounding sustainable cities as quintessential complex systems in terms of their development planning, operational management, and fragmentary design strategies and technology solutions. That is to say, sustainable cities are increasingly embracing and leveraging what smart cities have to offer in terms of big data technologies and their novel applications in an attempt to effectively deal with the complexities they inherently embody and to monitor, evaluate, and improve their performance with respect to sustainability—under what has been termed “data-driven smart sustainable cities.” This new area is a significant gap in and of itself—as it is still in its infancy—that this paper seeks to fill together with to what extent the integration of sustainable urbanism and smart urbanism is addressed and what directions and forms it takes. Using a compelling evidence synthesis approach, this paper provides a comprehensive state-of-the-art literature review of the flourishing field of data-driven smart sustainable cities. This study corroborates that big data technologies will change sustainable urbanism in fundamental and irreversible ways, bringing new and innovative ways of monitoring, understanding, analyzing, planning, and managing sustainable cities. It reveals that the evolving development planning approaches and operational management mechanisms enabled by data-driven technologies are of crucial importance to increase and maintain the contribution of sustainable cities to the goals of sustainability in the face of urbanization. However, what smart urbanism entails and the way it functions raises several critical questions, including whether the policy and governance of data-driven smart sustainable cities of the future will become too technocentric and technocratic respectively, but also with regard to other aspects of social and environmental sustainability. Addressing these important contemporary concerns is of equal importance in achieving the desired outcomes of sustainability. This review and critique of the existing work on the prevailing and emerging paradigms of urbanism provides a valuable reference for scholars and practitioners and the necessary material to inform them of the latest developments in the burgeoning field of data-driven smart sustainable cities. In addition, by shedding light on the increasing adoption and uptake of big data technologies in sustainable urbanism, this study seeks to help policymakers and planners assess the pros and cons of smart urbanism when effectuating sustainable urban transformations in the era of big data, as well as to stimulate prospective research and further critical debates on the topic.},

Sustainable urban development emerges as an essential planning goal in many jurisdictions seeking to cope with urbanization pressures. To achieve urban sustainability objectives, the notion of a “smart city” becomes a promising policy option. Yet, little is known about the emergence of smart urban solutions in the African context. Analyzing Accra City Extension Project (ACEP)—an urban strategy for urbanization pressures in the Greater Accra Region, Ghana, this chapter contributes to understandings of the “how” and “why” particular smart urban solutions emerge and are adopted in African cities. Through in-depth interviews and document analysis, the findings indicate that multiple rationalities, including achieving orderly and efficient spatial development, infrastructure provision, liveability, land value capture, and inclusive urban development underpin the production of ACEP. Multiple actors such as central and local governments, traditional authorities, landowners, technocrats, private developers, residents, and transnational organizations with varied interests were involved in ACEP. To private investors and landowners, economic values were the main motivations; however, this is contrary to the general project visions of promoting urban sustainability and social inclusion. There was evidence of parallel and conflicting institutional arrangement for the project implementation. It is concluded that the project risks not achieving its aim of creating a sustainable, inclusive, and liveable urban environment, and at worst, it might become an urban fantasy plan that deepens inequality and marginalization.},

abstract = {Smart City (SC) strategies that aim at fostering sustainable urban development through the systemic implementation of modern information and communication technologies (ICTs) continue to appeal to national and municipal governments despite of increasingly skeptical academic debates. Especially in Asian emerging economies aspirations to create SCs are widespread, yet seem hopelessly illusionary in many cases and might actually harm rather than benefit most citizens. This paper acknowledges these critical views, yet also accentuates constructive perspectives on SC achievements that offer rays of hope especially for cities in less developed countries. We propose to emphasize influential process qualities of SC strategies, which can instigate broader governance and institutional transformations locally, rather than mainly looking at the technical product features of final SC settings. Refined conceptual distinctions between the product and process view on achievable outcomes of SC schemes are suggested which also borrow from evolutionary geography perspectives. To illustrate our propositions, the example of India's Smart Cities Mission launched in 2015 is used. While the planned refurbishment of urban spaces in India is rightfully criticized by some, our own qualitative empirical research – a multiple case study analysis of five SC schemes in South India in spring 2018 – reveals several promising process qualities besides implementation deficiencies. Our study finds eight mechanisms of detrimental path dependency that obstruct SC progress, but also eight mechanisms of positive evolutionary change with respect to urban governance procedures. Making agents in emerging economies aware of these potential outcomes that reach beyond a mere urban technology focus can inspire more effective forthcoming SC strategies and policies.},

abstract = {‘Smart' imaginaries have been enthusiastically embraced by urban planners and policymakers around the world. Indians are no exception. Between 2015–2018, following national government guidelines to use participatory and inclusive processes, many cities developed proposals for a smart city challenge. Successful proposals received financial and technical support from the national government. We examine the making of the smart city proposal submitted by New Town Kolkata (NTK). We ask how (un)democratic was the making of the proposal, along three aspects: distributive, participatory, and responsive. Based on an analysis of documents and interviews with policymakers and citizens, we find that NTK's smart city imaginary largely failed to be distributive. It rarely accounted for the specific needs of poorer and vulnerable citizens. City officials invested considerable effort in using participatory techniques, but citizen participation was tightly controlled through top-down design and practice of the techniques. The latter often facilitated one-way flow of information from the city administration to the citizens. The proposal was responsive to some citizens' voices, but only those belonging to the more affluent classes. A messy diversity of citizens' voices was thus closed down, as the city officials filtered and cherry-picked citizens' voices that were well-aligned with the official technocratic vision of ‘global' smart urbanism. The paper shows how democracy can be put in the service of technocracy, within a rhetoric of citizen participation and social inclusion that embodies smart urbanism.},

A smart city uses cutting-edge technologies to improve the quality, performance and interactivity of urban services, optimize resources, and foster sustainable and well-connected societies. A critical component within this paradigm is the domain of transportation, where the application of artificial intelligence is fundamentally transforming how we navigate our cities. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive exploration of the evolving landscape of AI within the context of intelligent mobility and smart cities, with a specific focus on our contributions in this field. This investigation not only highlights the advances in this field but also focuses specifically on the significant contributions of Autonomous Mobility and Perception Lab (AMPL) to deploying AI in developing intelligent mobility solutions. As urban areas worldwide grapple with the complexities of growing populations and the increasing demand for efficient, sustainable transportation, the critical role of implementing smart city concepts, especially intelligent mobility systems, becomes evident. This exploration is not merely a review of our strides; it is a voyage into the future, showing how AI continues to reshape urban transportation within the smart city paradigm.},

abstract = {Cities are increasingly turning towards specialized technologies to address issues related to society, ecology, morphology and many others. The emerging concept of Smart Cities highly encourages this prospect by promoting the incorporation of sensors and Big Data through the Internet of Things (IoT). This surge of data brings new possibilities in the design and management of cities just as much as economic prospects. While Big Data processing through Artificial Intelligence (AI) can greatly contribute to the urban fabric, sustainability and liveability dimensions however must not be overlooked in favour of technological ones. This paper reviews the urban potential of AI and proposes a new framework binding AI technology and cities while ensuring the integration of key dimensions of Culture, Metabolism and Governance; which are known to be primordial in the successful integration of Smart Cities for the compliance to the Sustainable Development Goal 11 and the New Urban Agenda. This paper is aimed towards Policy Makers, Data Scientists and Engineers who are looking at enhancing the integration of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data in Smart Cities with an aim to increase the liveability of the urban fabric while boosting economic growth and opportunities.},

abstract = {Although there has been a growing body of research on the detrimental effects of electronic waste (e-waste) in emerging economies, this fails to capture a complete picture of the subject. The purpose of this paper is to address this deficit in our understanding by developing a unified perspective of the effects of e-waste. The paper advances three main perspectives (i.e. the positive, detrimental and the unified perspectives) of the effects of e-waste in emerging economies. These perspectives unify the existing scattered streams of research on the subject to offer more robust explanations of the effects of e-waste in developing countries. Through an illustrative case of an emerging economy, the paper demonstrates that contrary to the perceived view that e-waste from advanced economies to developing countries is detrimental; some sectors such as the second-hand market, aftermarket and repair industry have flourished. The paper outlines a range of strategies for countries that can be adopted to develop and enhance environmental sustainability.},

abstract = {Smart cities are increasingly advocated by governments and the private sector as the primary means to deliver urban sustainability. Particularly in Europe and North America, the smart city is envisioned as a place where digital technologies are deployed to ‘solve' urban sustainability problems. Such visions have been broadly critiqued in the urban studies literature for reflecting techno-utopian, neoliberal approaches to urban development that exert corporate control over cities, but there has been little empirical verification of these critiques. More recently, a disparate and interdisciplinary body of literature has emerged documenting the impacts of smart city initiatives in practice. This paper provides a state-of-the-art, empirically informed analysis of smart-sustainability, which considers established critiques of smart city policy and visions alongside the increasing body of evidence concerning the actual experiences of smart city initiatives. Through a systematic review of the smart city literature pertaining to Europe and North America, we identify and test five tensions between the smart city and the goals of sustainable urban development. These tensions involve: (1) reinforcing neoliberal economic growth; (2) focusing on more affluent populations; (3) disempowering and marginalising citizens; (4) neglecting environmental protection; and, (5) failing to challenge prevailing consumerist cultures. On the basis of these findings we propose how digital technologists, urban developers, municipalities and citizens might address these tensions. A key finding is that the potential to empower and include citizens represents the key to unlocking forms of smart-sustainable urban development that emphasise environmental protection and social equity, rather than merely reinforcing neoliberal forms of urban development.},

abstract = {As metropolitan populations increase and the demand for environmentally friendly lifestyles increases, the growth of IoT-enabled smart cities promises a viable route for overcoming the complex concerns of energy management, sustainable development, and financial optimization. By presenting a deep learning method to energy management, this research article delves into the quest of sustainability in smart cities. The study describes an innovative framework for optimizing energy utilization in IoT-connected smart cities by leveraging the potential of deep learning algorithms. It uses real-time data from a number of sources, including sensors, devices, as well as smart grids, to allow smart energy saving and efficiency decisions. The proposed approach conforms to dynamic utilization trends and gives precise demand estimates by utilizing deep learning models including neural networks and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Through detailed simulations and realistic case studies done in several smart cities throughout the world, the research paper proves the effectiveness of the deep learning-based strategy. The findings show significant reductions in energy usage, cost savings, and significant contributions to greenhouse gas emissions elimination, eventually increasing environmental sustainability. Additionally, the framework's versatility and scalability highlight its application in a variety of urban situations. This study article not only tackles current energy management issues, but it also sets the framework for a more environmentally conscious as well as effective urban future.},

@article{Mutambik2024,
abstract = {Since the idea of the smart city was first introduced, over two decades ago, there has been an increasing focus on sustainability as a core strategic priority. However, as the relevance, importance and even definition of sustainability is a function of cultural context, planners must take account of local and regional cultural factors in the selection and adaption of digital infrastructures, as well as in the management and encouragement of public acceptance. Achieving this is not a sequential process, but a concurrent one, as these factors are interdependent. This raises the question of what factors affect and mediate the technology, choice, and public acceptance of smart sustainable cities. This paper attempts to address this question by proposing a new model which advances our current, and considerable, understanding of Technology Acceptance Modelling—using an analysis based on Structural Equation Modelling. This new model, called the Culturally Informed Technology Acceptance Model, was validated using data from a survey of residents of a variety of Saudi Arabian cities. The proposed model is designed around important factors that can be influenced by cultural context, such as digital literacy, process improvements, cost savings and privacy, and is a useful tool for understanding the role of culture in the public acceptance of smart sustainable technology. This design focus is for a number of reasons, such as helping development bodies ensure that the technologies used align with the socio-cultural context. It will also help in the management of at-scale technology roll out in a way that is resource-efficient. Although the Culturally Informed Technology Acceptance Model has been developed and validated using data from Saudi Arabia, the authors believe that it could be adapted to meet the needs of countries/cities that are looking to implement smart city strategies matched to their own distinct socio-cultural identity.},

abstract = {Sustainable cities have been the leading global paradigm of urbanism. Undoubtedly, sustainable development has, since its widespread diffusion in the early 1990s, positively influenced city planning and development. This pertains to the immense opportunities that have been explored and the enormous benefits that have been realized in relation to sustainable urban forms, especially compact cities and eco-cities. However, such forms are still associated with a number of problems, issues, and challenges. This mainly involves the question of how they should be monitored, understood, analyzed, and planned to improve, advance, and maintain their contribution to sustainability and thus to overcome the kind of wicked problems, unsettled issues, and complex challenges they embody. This in turn brings us to the current question related to the weak connection between and the extreme fragmentation of sustainable cities and smart cities as approaches and landscapes, respectively, despite the proven role of advanced ICT, coupled with the untapped potential of big data technology and its novel applications, in supporting sustainable cities as to enhancing and optimizing their performance under what is labeled “smart sustainable cities.” In this respect, there has recently been a conscious push for sustainable cities to become smart and thus more sustainable by particularly embracing what big data technology and its novel applications has to offer in the hopes of reaching the optimal level of sustainability. In the meantime, we are in the midst of an expansion of time horizons in city planning and development. In this context, sustainable cities across the globe have adopted ambitious smart goals that extend far into the future. Essentially, there are multiple visions of, and pathways to achieving, smart sustainable cities based on how they can be conceptualized and operationalized. The aim of this paper is to generate a vision for smart sustainable cities of the future by answering the 6 guiding questions for step 3 of the futures study being conducted. This study aims to analyze, investigate, and develop a novel model for smart sustainable cities of the future using backcasting as a scholarly approach. It involves a series of papers of which this paper is the second one, following the earlier papers with steps 1 and 2. Visionary images of a long-term future can stimulate an accelerated movement towards achieving the long-term goals of sustainability. The proposed model is believed to be the first of its kind and thus has not been, to the best of one's knowledge, produced, nor is it being currently investigated, elsewhere.},

Yet despite numerous examples of this 'urban labelling' phenomenon, we know surprisingly little about so-called smart cities, particularly in terms of what the label ideologically reveals as well as hides. Due to its lack of definitional precision, not to mention an underlying self-congratulatory tendency, the main thrust of this article is to provide a preliminary critical polemic against some of the more rhetorical aspects of smart cities. The primary focus is on the labelling process adopted by some designated smart cities, with a view to problematizing a range of elements that supposedly characterize this new urban form, as well as question some of the underlying assumptions/ contradictions hidden within the concept. To aid this critique, the article explores to what extent labelled smart cities can be understood as a high-tech variation of the 'entrepreneurial city', as well as speculates on some general principles which would make them more progressive and inclusive.},

abstract = {There has recently been a conscious push for cities across the globe to be smart and even smarter and thus more sustainable by developing and implementing big data technologies and their applications across various urban domains in the hopes of reaching the required level of sustainability and improving the living standard of citizens. Having gained momentum and traction as a promising response to the needed transition towards sustainability and to the challenges of urbanisation, smart and smarter cities as approaches to data-driven urbanism are increasingly adopting the advanced forms of ICT to improve their performance in line with the goals of sustainable development and the requirements of urban growth. One of such forms that has tremendous potential to enhance urban operations, functions, services, designs, strategies, and policies in this direction is big data analytics and its application. This is due to the kind of well-informed decision-making and enhanced insights enabled by big data computing in the form of applied intelligence. However, topical studies on big data technologies and their applications in the context of smart and smarter cities tend to deal largely with economic growth and the quality of life in terms of service efficiency and betterment while overlooking and barely exploring the untapped potential of such applications for advancing sustainability. In fact, smart and smarter cities raise several issues and involve significant challenges when it comes to their development and implementation in the context of sustainability. With that in regard, this paper provides a comprehensive, state-of-the-art review and synthesis of the field of smart and smarter cities in relation to sustainability and related big data analytics and its application in terms of the underlying foundations and assumptions, research issues and debates, opportunities and benefits, technological developments, emerging trends, future practices, and challenges and open issues. This study shows that smart and smarter cities are associated with misunderstanding and deficiencies as regards their incorporation of, and contribution to, sustainability. Nevertheless, as also revealed by this study, tremendous opportunities are available for utilising big data analytics and its application in smart cities of the future to improve their contribution to the goals of sustainable development by optimising and enhancing urban operations, functions, services, designs, strategies, and policies, as well as by finding answers to challenging analytical questions and thereby advancing knowledge forms. However, just as there are immense opportunities ahead to embrace and exploit, there are enormous challenges and open issues ahead to address and overcome in order to achieve a successful implementation of big data technology and its novel applications in such cities.},

This transformation is often represented by a roadmap. Different approaches were introduced in the literature to assist in developing such a roadmap. However; a thorough analysis of these approaches shows none of them cover holistically all aspect of the SSCs. For instance, some roadmaps neglect analyzing the current challenges of a city. Others falls short in addressing one or more of the SSC six dimensions. None considers checking the city readiness for change. This constitutes a gap in knowledge that this research highlights and addresses through a sound theoretical foundation, specifically, by linking the Theory of Change to the SSC concept and introducing a theoretical logic model for the transformation towards SSCs. The latter is used to propose a coherent, systematic transformation roadmap that captures the cross-cutting readiness of a city along its infrastructures. It aims at assisting city planners, decision makers, and key stakeholders in understanding the essential aspects to be considered during their cities transformation journey. This research also summarizes the results of an undertaken validation process, confirming the components of the proposed roadmap.},

abstract = {Over the last couple of decades, metropolitan areas around the world have been engaged in a multitude of initiatives aimed at upgrading urban infrastructure and services, with a view to creating better environmental, social and economic conditions and enhancing cities' attractiveness and competitiveness. Reflecting these developments, many new categories of 'cities' have entered the policy discourse: 'sustainable cities'; 'green cities'; 'digital cities'; 'smart cities'; intelligent cities'; 'information cities'; 'knowledge cities'; 'resilient cities'; 'eco cities'; 'low carbon cities'; 'liveable cities'; and even combinations, such as 'low carbon eco cities' and 'ubiquitous eco cities'. In practice, these terms often appear to be used interchangeably by policy makers, planners and developers. However, the question arises whether these categories nevertheless each embody distinct conceptual perspectives, which would have implications for how they are understood theoretically and applied in policy. In response, this article investigates, through a comprehensive bibliometric analysis, how the twelve most frequent city categories are conceptualised individually and in relation to one another in the academic literature. We hypothesize that, notwithstanding some degree of overlap and cross-fertilization, in their essence the observed categories each harbor particular conceptual perspectives that render them distinctive. This is borne out by the findings, which demonstrate robustly for the first time the conceptual differences and interrelationships among twelve dominant city categories. The 'sustainable city' is the most frequently occurring category and, in a map of keyword co-occurrences, by far the largest and most interconnected node, linked closely to the 'eco city' and 'green city' concepts. Recently, the more narrow concepts of 'low carbon city' and 'smart city' have been on the rise, judging by their frequency of occurrence in academic journals; the latter in particular appears to have become an increasingly dominant category of urban modernization policy. On their part, 'resilient city' and 'knowledge city' represent distinct concepts, albeit with comparatively low frequency. Overall, the findings point to the need for rigor and nuance in the use of these terms, not least if one wishes to comprehend their implications for urban development and regeneration policy and practice.},

abstract = {REMOURBAN is an European project whose main objective is the development and validation in three lighthouse cities (Valladolid-Spain, Nottingham-UK and Tepebasi/Eskisehir-Turkey) of a sustainable urban regeneration model that leverages the convergence area of the energy, mobility and ICT sectors in order to accelerate the deployment of innovative technologies, organizational and economic solutions to significantly increase resource and energy efficiency, improve the sustainability of urban transport and drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions in urban areas. For developing this model, REMOURBAN is implementing several strategies at city level based on: the creation of a holistic catalogue of innovative technologies and solutions on energy, mobility and ICTs favouring the replicability, the identification and overcome of nontechnical barriers, the development of new integrated business models oriented at the creation of a European market for innovation and the definition of a complete evaluation procedure using sustainability and smartness indicators. This urban renovation strategy is focused on the citizens, where they become the cornerstones to making a smart city a reality For this reason, citizens are being actively engaged in REMOURBAN and the population awareness about energy and environmental impact of their daily activities are increased. In order to ensure the usefulness and high replication of the REMOURBAN project at European level, the sustainable urban regeneration model is aimed at the decision makers, investors, public administrations and the industrial sector. Furthermore, in order to ensure this replicability, two follower cities, Seraing (Belgium) and Miskolc (Hungary) are involved in the project so they can apply the developed model once it is validated. The project will allow demonstrating that, by means of improving the current conditions of a city, it is possible to achieve low energy districts and more sustainable urban transport, as well as to perceive a greater quality of life. REMOURBAN, thus, will focus on improving the energy efficiency, reduction of GHG emissions, refurbishment of districts, transport sustainability, access to urban information and citizen engagement. A big impact across Europe is intended to be achieved by the REMOURBAN project results at European level, showing the model for sustainable urban regeneration can be easily applied and replicated. With the aim at maximizing the impact of the project results, REMOURBAN is deploying a powerful communication and dissemination plan that integrates a citizen engagement strategy and has started to disseminate the benefits of the project to a wide variety of audiences.},

While the extant literature has underscored the significance of each of these elements, their interconnected and symbiotic relationship demands a more profound exploration. Grounded in a systematic review of the existing literature and relevant case studies, this paper explored the intricate interplay between digital transformation, infrastructure development, service delivery, and governance in contemporary society, all in the pursuit of cultivating smart sustainable cities. It contends that by collaboratively working together, these four pillars possess the transformative potential to turn cities into smart and sustainable cities. Digital transformation emerges as the catalyst, propelling innovation and efficiency, while infrastructure forms the bedrock for the seamless delivery of services. Effective governance, in turn, ensures alignment with the evolving needs of citizens. In essence, this study underscores the transformative power of combined action, asserting that the interdependent elements within can transform cities beyond merely having smart or sustainable status to become smart sustainable cities. This paradigm shift harmonizes technological advancements with the foundational goals of sustainable development, steering towards a holistic and inclusive urban future.},

Using the context of the city of Bloemfontein, South Africa and drawing on the perceptions of stakeholders, the objective of the paper is to offer a perspective on such a transformation. The study first assessed the performance of various factors and attributes that influence three important aspects of a smart city: economy, mobility and governance system. It then recorded the viewpoints of stakeholders about how these aspects can contribute to the development of a smart city. Further, Applied Systems Analysis (ASA) linked System Dynamics (SD) conceptual models based on the interlinkage and causal feedback relationships among various factors under each aspect were developed, which could assist in offering perspectives that would enable eliciting of policy interventions to develop smart cities. Findings indicate that there are potentials and positive indicators in all three aspects. It is emerged that reinforcement of the inter-relationship among entrepreneurship, innovation, productivity, economic image and international embeddedness will foster a smart economy. Efficient public transportation and advancement of Information Communication Technology (ICT) system will strengthen local accessibility and ensure an innovative, sustainable and safe transportation system that will result in smart mobility. Effective participation of stakeholders in the decision making process alongside the elected city council and transparency will aid smart governance. The combined effect of these attributes should enable the transformation of the city to a smart city.},

To address this insufficiency, we utilized Python language and the Selenium library to realize a web crawler and construct a smart city corpus background library. Then, the word2vec model was used for word vectorization to divide policy texts into phrases, and 132 policies from 85 cities above the prefecture level in China were analyzed using the Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The results showed many problems in the smart city construction process in China, including the homogenization of content, the wide topic coverage, the influence of higher-level governments, the mismatch with the local situation, and the neglect of relationship governance. Moreover, an efficiency-governance model was designed, and it held certain theoretical and practical guiding significance for further promoting the healthy and sustainable development of smart city construction in China.},

abstract = {City assessment tools can be used as support for decision making in urban development as they provide assessment methodologies for cities to show the progress towards defined targets. In the 21st century, there has been a shift from sustainability assessment to smart city goals. We analyze 16 sets of city assessment frameworks (eight smart city and eight urban sustainability assessment frameworks) comprising 958 indicators altogether by dividing the indicators under three impact categories and 12 sectors. The following main observations derive from the analyses: as expected, there is a much stronger focus on modern technologies and “smartness” in the smart city frameworks compared to urban sustainability frameworks. Another observation is that as urban sustainability frameworks contain a large number of indicators measuring environmental sustainability, smart city frameworks lack environmental indicators while highlighting social and economic aspects. A general goal of smart cities is to improve sustainability with help of technologies. Thus, we recommend the use of a more accurate term “smart sustainable cities” instead of smart cities. However, the current large gap between smart city and sustainable city frameworks suggest that there is a need for developing smart city frameworks further or re-defining the smart city concept. We recommend that the assessment of smart city performance should not only use output indicators that measure the efficiency of deployment of smart solutions but also impact indicators that measure the contribution towards the ultimate goals such as environmental, economic or social sustainability.},

As expected, most strategies emphasize the role of information and communication technologies in improving the functionality of urban systems and advancing knowledge transfer and innovation networks. However, this research yields other interesting findings that may not yet have been documented across multiple case studies; for example, most smart city strategies fail to incorporate bottom-up approaches, are poorly adapted to accommodate the local needs of their area, and consider issues of privacy and security inadequately.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most disruptive technologies of our time. Interest in the use of AI for urban innovation continues to grow. Particularly, the rise of smart cities—urban locations that are enabled by community, technology, and policy to deliver productivity, innovation, livability, wellbeing, sustainability, accessibility, good governance, and good planning—has increased the demand for AI-enabled innovations. There is, nevertheless, no scholarly work that provides a comprehensive review on the topic. This paper generates insights into how AI can contribute to the development of smarter cities. A systematic review of the literature is selected as the methodologic approach. Results are categorized under the main smart city development dimensions, i.e., economy, society, environment, and governance. The findings of the systematic review containing 93 articles disclose that: (a) AI in the context of smart cities is an emerging field of research and practice. (b) The central focus of the literature is on AI technologies, algorithms, and their current and prospective applications. (c) AI applications in the context of smart cities mainly concentrate on business efficiency, data analytics, education, energy, environmental sustainability, health, land use, security, transport, and urban management areas. (d) There is limited scholarly research investigating the risks of wider AI utilization. (e) Upcoming disruptions of AI in cities and societies have not been adequately examined. Current and potential contributions of AI to the development of smarter cities are outlined in this paper to inform scholars of prospective areas for further research.},

abstract = {'Smart cities' is a term that has gained traction in academia, business and government to describe cities that, on the one hand, are increasingly composed of and monitored by pervasive and ubiquitous computing and, on the other, whose economy and governance is being driven by innovation, creativity and entrepreneurship, enacted by smart people. This paper focuses on the former and, drawing on a number of examples, details how cities are being instrumented with digital devices and infrastructure that produce 'big data'. Such data, smart city advocates argue enables real-time analysis of city life, new modes of urban governance, and provides the raw material for envisioning and enacting more efficient, sustainable, competitive, productive, open and transparent cities. The final section of the paper provides a critical reflection on the implications of big data and smart urbanism, examining five emerging concerns: the politics of big urban data, technocratic governance and city development, corporatisation of city governance and technological lock-ins, buggy, brittle and hackable cities, and the panoptic city. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {Smart cities' embrace technologically based solutions as an enabler of efficient, affordable and more sustainable urban living in times of resource scarcity, persistent austerity and high-tech innovations. However, cities' evermore complex systems are, albeit unwittingly, causing mismanagement, future uncertainty and lack of transparency to exacerbate their challenges. Climate change is likely to be the greatest of the contextual challenge scale and in terms of scale and diversity of impacts. This paper explores the role of smartness indicators, in which 'green' undoubtedly is a large innovation engine, yet not the only one. Similarly, the beneficial impacts of 'green' technology solutions are yet to be fully understood or rigorously established. Cities that adopted smart roadmaps embedded lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions within the environmental sustainability agenda; however, the degree to which the two issues have been directly linked is unclear. Findings from this study suggest that lower carbon dioxide emission initiatives are embodied within the environmental sustainability initiatives agenda, yet are not clearly defined in the smart cities ideology. This paper proposes a balanced combination of human talent, 'green' innovation and technological innovation - the interdependent triptych philosophy for 'smart city' resilience that can be adapted and offer tailored solutions for cities, communities and individuals.},

abstract = {The Government of India has undertaken a novel step towards building new smart cities as well as transforming some of its existing cities into smart cities. However, tension relating to the governance of smart cities has emerged. Therefore, a mixed-methods approach was used based on a perception survey, case studies, and discussions with stakeholders and experts, to examine the current governance challenges in transforming existing cities into smart cities, and to explore various perspectives to propose a framework for an appropriate governance system for developing smart cities in India. The findings suggested that the current executive-led governance system, with special-purpose vehicles (SPVs) under the control of the state governments as the promoters of smart city development, might not lead to the smart governance system envisaged but, rather, add confusion and conflict, and undermine the constitutionally mandated, legislative-led urban local bodies. The argument in this article is for a people-centric, balanced governance approach with strengthened urban local bodies, enabled by advanced digital technology and the constructive participation of different social solidarities, in which the SPVs would act as the intellectual and executive wing of the urban local bodies.},

abstract = {Smart city development has emerged as a favoured response to the 21st-century urbanisation challenges. A wide range of definitions surfaced over the last decade characterising the smart city, primarily pushed by the global elite corporations and influential academics. Simultaneously, a series of urban development expressions, such as digital city, knowledge city, eco-city is used interchangeably with the smart city, significantly mystifying the reading of the concept. This paper, first argue that smart city interpretation needs and requires the input and contribution of the local stakeholders. The aim of this research is to provide an evidence-based framework to capture the perception of local urban actors in India vis-{\`{a}}-vis their interpretation of smart cities given the existing urban conditions and the proposed developments under the 100 Smart Cities Mission. This research also examines the underlying linkage between the smart city and its conceptual relatives and highlights the ones with a significant convergence with the emerging urban agenda in India's Smart Cities Mission. The analysis presented in this paper show that to emerge as a holistic concept, smart cities definition models should engage with the sustainability and community issues, beyond the use of digital technology. The research reveals that the Indian urban stakeholders strongly associate the smart city concept with sustainable city and eco-city, much more than the technology-loaded phrases such as ubiquitous city and digital city. The first-of-its-kind inclusive approach developed in this paper to define smart city takes on the monopolies of top-down smart city definitions and support the democratisation of the rapidly proliferating concept.},

abstract = {Here we sketch the rudiments of what constitutes a smart city which we define as a city in which ICT is merged with traditional infrastructures, coordinated and integrated using new digital technologies. We first sketch our vision defining seven goals which concern: developing a new understanding of urban problems; effective and feasible ways to coordinate urban technologies; models and methods for using urban data across spatial and temporal scales; developing new technologies for communication and dissemination; developing new forms of urban governance and organisation; defining critical problems relating to cities, transport, and energy; and identifying risk, uncertainty, and hazards in the smart city. To this, we add six research challenges: to relate the infrastructure of smart cities to their operational functioning and planning through management, control and optimisation; to explore the notion of the city as a laboratory for innovation; to provide portfolios of urban simulation which inform future designs; to develop technologies that ensure equity, fairness and realise a better quality of city life; to develop technologies that ensure informed participation and create shared knowledge for democratic city governance; and to ensure greater and more effective mobility and access to opportunities for urban populations.We begin by defining the state of the art, explaining the science of smart cities. We define six scenarios based on new cities badging themselves as smart, older cities regenerating themselves as smart, the development of science parks, tech cities, and technopoles focused on high technologies, the development of urban services using contemporary ICT, the use of ICT to develop new urban intelligence functions, and the development of online and mobile forms of participation. Seven project areas are then proposed: Integrated Databases for the Smart City, Sensing, Networking and the Impact of New Social Media, Modelling Network Performance, Mobility and Travel Behaviour, Modelling Urban Land Use, Transport and Economic Interactions, Modelling Urban Transactional Activities in Labour and Housing Markets, Decision Support as Urban Intelligence, Participatory Governance and Planning Structures for the Smart City. Finally we anticipate the paradigm shifts that will occur in this research and define a series of key demonstrators which we believe are important to progressing a science of smart cities.{\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.},

abstract = {It is well known that sustainability has become a much needed target, especially considering the recent rapid urban sprawl and the subsequent exacerbation of social, environmental, and economic problems. Thus, many studies have been conducted to define sustainability and the sustainable city. However, many of these definitions suggest a range of contradictions, implying that the achievement of sustainability is elusive. The problem lies in setting unreasonable definitions of sustainability and in the various contradictions to these definitions, making sustainability seemingly unattainable. Hence, some models of cities are emerging that are labeled as sustainable cities; among these are the “zero-carbon city” and the “ubiquitous eco-city” (“U-eco-city”). This study reviews the history and definitions of sustainability, in order to acknowledge the contradictions inherent in these concepts. It also briefly presents the compact city, the zero-carbon eco-city, and the U-eco-city by determining their individual pros and cons and highlighting where there are any conflicts with the principles of sustainability. The aim of the study was to adjust the use of sustainability as a terminology in the field of urban sustainable development and to demonstrate the extent to which we use marketing names for eco-cities without compliance with sustainable dimensions. The study will also discuss the key sustainability pillar required for a project to be kept sustainable. The study concludes that the use of the term “sustainable city” may limit the potential for further enhancing sustainability in future projects; using the term “transition toward the sustainable city” may be more accurate and more effective. The results show that reducing energy consumption through efficient use, and relying on renewable energies, will be the keys to reaching urban sustainability. The study also finds that recent tyranny in the name of ecology will not result in real sustainability. Although the free eco-city and the u-eco-city are considered advanced models, their limitations are related more to the economic and social aspects than to the compact city, which clearly reflected the pillars of sustainability, despite its being an outdated model.},

abstract = {We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to map raw pixels from a single front-facing camera directly to steering commands. This end-to-end approach proved surprisingly powerful. With minimum training data from humans the system learns to drive in traffic on local roads with or without lane markings and on highways. It also operates in areas with unclear visual guidance such as in parking lots and on unpaved roads. The system automatically learns internal representations of the necessary processing steps such as detecting useful road features with only the human steering angle as the training signal. We never explicitly trained it to detect, for example, the outline of roads. Compared to explicit decomposition of the problem, such as lane marking detection, path planning, and control, our end-to-end system optimizes all processing steps simultaneously. We argue that this will eventually lead to better performance and smaller systems. Better performance will result because the internal components self-optimize to maximize overall system performance, instead of optimizing human-selected intermediate criteria, e.g., lane detection. Such criteria understandably are selected for ease of human interpretation which doesn't automatically guarantee maximum system performance. Smaller networks are possible because the system learns to solve the problem with the minimal number of processing steps. We used an NVIDIA DevBox and Torch 7 for training and an NVIDIA DRIVE(TM) PX self-driving car computer also running Torch 7 for determining where to drive. The system operates at 30 frames per second (FPS).},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the key components of the ICT infrastructure of smart sustainable cities as an emerging urban development approach due to its great potential to advance environmental sustainability. As one of the prevalent ICT visions or computing paradigms, the IoT is associated with big data analytics, which is clearly on a penetrative path across many urban domains for optimizing energy efficiency and mitigating environmental effects. This pertains mainly to the effective utilization of natural resources, the intelligent management of infrastructures and facilities, and the enhanced delivery of services in support of the environment. As such, the IoT and related big data applications can play a key role in catalyzing and improving the process of environmentally sustainable development. However, topical studies tend to deal largely with the IoT and related big data applications in connection with economic growth and the quality of life in the realm of smart cities, and largely ignore their role in improving environmental sustainability in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. In addition, several advanced technologies are being used in smart cities without making any contribution to environmental sustainability, and the strategies through which sustainable cities can be achieved fall short in considering advanced technologies. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to review and synthesize the relevant literature with the objective of identifying and discussing the state-of-the-art sensor-based big data applications enabled by the IoT for environmental sustainability and related data processing platforms and computing models in the context of smart sustainable cities of the future. Also, this paper identifies the key challenges pertaining to the IoT and big data analytics, as well as discusses some of the associated open issues. Furthermore, it explores the opportunity of augmenting the informational landscape of smart sustainable cities with big data applications to achieve the required level of environmental sustainability. In doing so, it proposes a framework which brings together a large number of previous studies on smart cities and sustainable cities, including research directed at a more conceptual, analytical, and overarching level, as well as research on specific technologies and their novel applications. The goal of this study suits a mix of two research approaches: topical literature review and thematic analysis. In terms of originality, no study has been conducted on the IoT and related big data applications in the context of smart sustainable cities, and this paper provides a basis for urban researchers to draw on this analytical framework in future research. The proposed framework, which can be replicated, tested, and evaluated in empirical research, will add additional depth to studies in the field of smart sustainable cities. This paper serves to inform urban planners, scholars, ICT experts, and other city stakeholders about the environmental benefits that can be gained from implementing smart sustainable city initiatives and projects on the basis of the IoT and related big data applications.},

abstract = {This paper provides a comprehensive overview of digital inclusion initiatives aimed at mitigating the connectivity gap in Africa and the United States. As the world becomes increasingly reliant on digital technologies, the importance of ensuring equitable access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) has become a global priority. This review explores the current state of digital inclusion efforts in two distinct regions, Africa and the USA, to understand the challenges, successes, and lessons learned in bridging the digital divide. The first section of the review focuses on Africa, where disparities in digital access are particularly pronounced. Examining various initiatives, policies, and strategies implemented by governments, non-governmental organizations, and international partners, the review delves into the multifaceted approaches taken to extend connectivity to underserved populations. It highlights the role of innovative solutions such as community networks, mobile technologies, and public-private partnerships in fostering digital inclusion across diverse socioeconomic landscapes. In the second section, the review turns its attention to the United States, where digital inclusion efforts also face challenges despite higher overall connectivity rates. By analyzing federal and local initiatives, as well as private sector contributions, the review explores the nuances of digital inclusion in an advanced technological landscape. The examination encompasses efforts to address urban-rural disparities, promote digital literacy, and ensure affordable broadband access for marginalized communities. Comparative analysis between the two regions identifies commonalities and differences in the approaches to digital inclusion. The review assesses the impact of cultural, economic, and political factors on the effectiveness of initiatives, emphasizing the need for context-specific strategies. Furthermore, it evaluates the role of regulatory frameworks and policy interventions in shaping the trajectory of digital inclusion initiatives. Drawing from the experiences of both continents, this review contributes insights to inform future digital inclusion policies and practices globally. By synthesizing the lessons learned from Africa and the USA, policymakers, researchers, and practitioners can develop more nuanced and contextually relevant strategies to bridge the connectivity gap, fostering a more inclusive and equitable digital future for all.},

abstract = {As an emerging economic form, the digital economy is a crucial force in promoting high-quality economic development, resolving regional development incoherence, and improving the level of urban resilience. In this paper, the urban resilience indicator system is composed of four dimensions: social resilience, economic resilience, infrastructure resilience, and ecological resilience. Meanwhile, the digital economy indicator system is composed of five dimensions: Internet penetration rate, number of Internet-related employees, Internet-related output, number of mobile Internet users, and digital financial inclusion development. The development level was measured using the entropy value method and principal component analysis. On this basis, the impact of the digital economy on the urban resilience of 185 prefecture-level cities in China from 2011 to 2019 was analyzed using a benchmark regression model, spatial econometric model, and mediating effect model. This study shows the following: (1) The development of the digital economy has a positive impact on improving urban resilience. (2) The digital economy affects urban resilience with positive spatial spillover effects, and the temporal heterogeneity and heterogeneity of external openness levels are significant, while the regional heterogeneity is not significant. (3) The digital economy can improve urban resilience through the intermediary role of technological innovation. In the future, we should strengthen digital construction, deeply integrate the relationship between the digital economy, technological innovation, and urban resilience, give full play to the engine role of the digital economy, and further promote the enhancement of sustainable urban development.},

One special form of business incubator is the Climate Innovation Centre (CIC) which is part of international debates around green economies and appropriate technologies for climate-compatible development. CICs are an intervention to build innovation sites to ameliorate climate change and a highly distinctive form of business incubator in which the explicit focus is upon supporting small business start-ups allied to the application of green technologies. Using a qualitative approach the article analyses the establishment and operations of the Gauteng Climate Innovation Centre in South Africa. The CICSA in its first five years of operations has been 'learning through experience' and introduced a number of changes since its launch in 2012, including an extension of the business incubation programme and an adjusted focus to South Africa's climate change related 'green' issues around energy, water and waste. Although 5 years is too short for a conclusive evaluation of CIC operations the evidence from this research with South African clean-tech enterprises is largely positive and suggests that the assistance provided by the CIC has contributed towards enterprise development.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of local entrepreneurs, embedded in both the civil and the business arena, in creating public value by establishing strategic collaboration around smart technologies. Design/methodology/approach: The paper suggests a novel – the local entrepreneurial – type of smart bottom-up initiative between civil grassroots and market-based initiatives. This idea is further evolved in the paper to define the patterns of this alternative type of smart bottom-up initiative. For this purpose, the paper conducts a case study of a community-based sustainable energy and mobility system launched by a local entrepreneur in Utrecht, the Netherlands. Findings: The local entrepreneur has played a catalyzing role in public value creation by initiating and upscaling cooperative practices around smart technologies. This success has mainly been achieved due to the entrepreneurial attitudes of pioneering and risk-taking as well as the capability to bridge between the state, the market and society to accelerate urban sustainability transition. Practical implications: This paper offers a practical illustration of the potential of local entrepreneurs to evolve cooperative practices with smart technologies for societal change. It also shows the vital role of local governments in the achievement of bottom-up initiatives contributing to urban smartness. However, in the case of commercializing initiatives, governments also need to take a balancing role to safeguard the needs of all citizens based on fairness and equity, which is at the core of public value creation. Originality/value: The study adds to the citizen participation literature by revealing a novel type of active citizen grasping technological opportunities to mobilize networks to cooperate for the collective good. The research also contributes to a better understanding of the bottom-up smart city as a form of governance, and its advantages as well as drawbacks concerning public value creation.},

Enhancing resilience is crucial, yet the comprehensive clustering of practical climate adaptation measures for use in construction industry decision-making is notably absent. This study investigates and categorizes various climate adaptation measures, justifying each through a lens of risk management, asset management, and previous scientific work. It takes advantage of the innovative digital platform Netobra, which offers an ecosystem for the construction industry, to provide real-world, practical implications of these measures. Informed by the Urban Resilience Evaluation System, ISO 31000 (risk management), and ISO 55000 (asset management), the study sets out to demonstrate the value of these measures in bolstering urban resilience and improving decision-making in the construction industry. Moreover, the study integrates a hotspot detection mechanism for areas at high risk of climate impacts, using multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA)—analytic hierarchy process (AHP) mapping on Netobra. These identified hotspots and corresponding climate adaptation measures will further be incorporated into a Risk-Informed Asset-Centric (RIACT) process, providing valuable insights for climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies in urban development. Through its in-depth analysis, the study aims to contribute to the understanding of how diverse climate adaptation measures can be practically applied in various sectors, thereby enhancing urban resilience and effective risk and asset management.},

abstract = {Sustainable cities have been the leading global paradigm of urbanism. Undoubtedly, sustainable development has, since its widespread diffusion in the early 1990s, positively influenced city planning and development. This pertains to the immense opportunities that have been explored and the enormous benefits that have been realized in relation to sustainable urban forms, especially compact cities and eco-cities. However, such forms are still associated with a number of problems, issues, and challenges. This mainly involves the question of how they should be monitored, understood, analyzed, and planned to improve, advance, and maintain their contribution to sustainability and thus to overcome the kind of wicked problems, unsettled issues, and complex challenges they embody. This in turn brings us to the current question related to the weak connection between and the extreme fragmentation of sustainable cities and smart cities as approaches and landscapes, respectively, despite the proven role of advanced ICT, coupled with the untapped potential of big data technology and its novel applications, in supporting sustainable cities as to enhancing and optimizing their performance under what is labeled “smart sustainable cities.” In this respect, there has recently been a conscious push for sustainable cities to become smart and thus more sustainable by particularly embracing what big data technology and its novel applications has to offer in the hopes of reaching the optimal level of sustainability. In the meantime, we are in the midst of an expansion of time horizons in city planning and development. In this context, sustainable cities across the globe have adopted ambitious smart goals that extend far into the future. Essentially, there are multiple visions of, and pathways to achieving, smart sustainable cities based on how they can be conceptualized and operationalized. The aim of this paper is to generate a vision for smart sustainable cities of the future by answering the 6 guiding questions for step 3 of the futures study being conducted. This study aims to analyze, investigate, and develop a novel model for smart sustainable cities of the future using backcasting as a scholarly approach. It involves a series of papers of which this paper is the second one, following the earlier papers with steps 1 and 2. Visionary images of a long-term future can stimulate an accelerated movement towards achieving the long-term goals of sustainability. The proposed model is believed to be the first of its kind and thus has not been, to the best of one's knowledge, produced, nor is it being currently investigated, elsewhere.},

It emphasises the importance of understanding and supporting circular start-ups for broader sustainability impacts. Unlike established firms, start-ups can readily adopt ambitious circular business models (CBMs) without the risk of business model cannibalisation and with the agility to adapt to market trends. CBMs enhance value creation, delivery and capture resource flows in an optimised non-linear fashion. Scaling up CBMs is crucial for overall economic, social and environmental benefits. Hence, leveraging the key entrepreneurial ecosystems actors, such as universities, business incubators and related venture development intermediaries, is vital for start-up support. In this special issue, we have invited researchers to submit contributions that delve into the dynamics among start-ups, entrepreneurial ecosystems and the circular economy, aiming to enrich our understanding of the early stage start-up development process with the aim of promoting the circular economy at a firm, regional or national level.},

In 2016, a survey was conducted on the 162 incubators active in Italy, and a total of 88 responses were received. An analysis of the literature and of this dataset led to the identification of three types of incubators: Business, Mixed, and Social. Thirty of the respondents sent information on their tenants. Thanks to the data regarding 247 tenants, it was possible to analyze the impact of the three different types of incubators (Business, Mixed, and Social) on the tenants' growth through OLS regression analyses. A Social Incubator is here defined as an incubator that supports more than 50% of start-ups that aim to introduce a positive social impact. The study shows that Social Incubators perceive social impact measurement and training/consulting on business ethics and CSR as being more important services than other incubator types. The regression analyses explain that Social Incubators are as efficient as other incubators, in terms of tenants' economic growth, notwithstanding the focus of Social Incubators on start-ups that do not pursue only economic objectives. Finally, this study indicates that policymakers can foster Social Incubators to support social entrepreneurship.},

Despite the potential of this bidirectional relationship, this connection has been less explored. In order to fill the gap, this paper reviews the extant literature in the field to contextualize the role that entrepreneurship plays in building smart cities and how smart cities influence entrepreneurial business models. I referred to 479 papers published until June 2017 on smart cities and 35 papers out of those related to entrepreneurship using the method of clustered content analysis. This article contributes towards increasing our understanding of this bidirectional relationship, and opens up research avenues for future research in the fields of smart cities and entrepreneurship.},

This systematic literature review explores three key research themes within the SRI literature, identifying a significant disconnect between themes and a fixation on the financial (as opposed to ethical) paradigm. One of the foundations of SRI is environmental, social, and governance (ESG) metrics. This review confirms the importance of ESG metrics in the SRI field, as they play two crucial roles, namely, as a proxy for sustainability performance and an enabler of the SRI market. However, there are two main issues related to ESG metrics that undermine their reliability: a lack of transparency and a lack of convergence.},

abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the effect of business incubation metrics based on an adaptation of the lean start-up (LS) framework on start-up survival after incubation. This study also analyzes the obstacles in implementing the LS framework as incubation metrics. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses mixed methods. Quantitative research using multiple linear regression was applied to the data of 30 start-ups incubated at Bandung Techno Park for the 2014–2017 period and survival tracking data after the incubation. A qualitative approach to complete the explanatory work was conducted through in-depth interviews with 12 respondents, including start-up graduates from the incubation program, program managers and mentors. Findings: This study confirms that several LS incubation metrics significantly affect start-up sustainability after incubation. In addition, this study also explains several problems in applying the LS discipline that needs attention to increase incubation success. Research limitations/implications: Research was conducted only at one technology business incubator (TBI) model that focuses on digital start-ups in the emerging ecosystem. Research results can be biased in different situations and ecosystems. Practical implications: The explanation of the relationship of LS-based incubation metrics to the survival of start-ups, as well as the challenges of their implementation, can be a reference for TBI management to consider and prioritize intervention strategies, thereby improving TBI's business processes and increasing the success rate of incubated start-ups. Social implications: The creation of university start-ups and spin-offs has become a key performance indicator mandatory for technology universities in Indonesia. The existence of TBI institutions in universities as channels of technology commercialization is essential. The incubator's success in creating a new technology-based company will have a significant social impact on the surrounding environment. Originality/value: Although the LS method is popular in start-up communities and among practitioners, it is rarely used in the incubation process at universities. These results can be considered for university TBIs to explore LS as an incubation management tool to increase the success rate of incubated start-ups.},

The effect of financing constraint policy on enterprise green technology innovation remains to be investigated. Based on the event of “green credit guidelines” issued by China Banking Regulatory Commission in 2012, this paper collects the panel data of China's 2825 listed companies from 2007 to 2018, constructs a difference-in-difference model, and studies the impact of green credit guidelines on corporate green technology innovation and its mechanism. The empirical results show: First, green credit guidelines can promote corporate green technology innovation on the whole. Second, the mechanism of green credit on enterprise green technology innovation is identified. Green credit guidelines mainly limited green technology innovation through reducing debt financing, rather than through financing constraints. Third, the impact of green credit guidelines on green technology innovation is heterogeneous. Green credit guidelines have a significant effect on the green technology innovation of state-owned and large enterprises, but have no effect on the green technology innovation of non-state-owned and small ones.},

abstract = {Green innovation is garnering increasing attention in business, academic and policy circles as a route to sustainable growth and development. Governments have introduced a range of policies to encourage and enable firms to introduce and expand their offerings of environmental friendly goods and services. While environmental regulation has been shown to be an important driver of green innovation, little is known about whether other types of polices, such as financial incentives, technical and marketing supports, and assistance with identifying potential markets, are important to firms of all sizes at different stages of the green innovation process (i.e., at product/service launch vs. product/service expansion). Using data from the European Commission, the results show that policy support to identify markets or customers is deemed important by firms of all sizes to introduce green goods and services. However, this support is no longer perceived as important to expand firms' green portfolio. This suggests firms capitalise by using their existing markets or customers. The results do not lend support to the view of small firms as the most resource constrained and hence needing the greatest policy supports. Overall, the results point to the need for a variety of policy supports targeted at (1) firms of different sizes and (2) by stage of the green innovation process.},

abstract = {Purpose: In spite of the availability of metrics for measuring social impact (SI), it can be difficult for organisations to select tools that fit their precise needs. To address this challenge, this study conducts a systematic literature review by using legitimacy theory as a point of departure. It examines tools that capture three dimensions of sustainability – social, economic and environmental (SEE) – and firm size. Design/methodology/approach: Top four journal databases in the social sciences from the FT50 review were searched to identify articles published in peer-reviewed journals in the 2009-2019 period, using keywords to conceptualise the construct. For comprehensive assessment, this study adopted a method that requires the logic synthesis of concepts and evidence emerging from the literature to address the research aim. Findings: The results show that most of the articles developed tools or frameworks to measure SI based on the triple bottom line of sustainability – SEE – and firm size. However, there is insufficient evidence of their integration into practice. Research limitations/implications: This work contributes to the legitimisation of social enterprises (SEs) by using validated tools and frameworks to develop practical suggestions for SI measurement (SIM). Originality/value: As legitimacy is an important rationale for SIM, this study adds value through the development of a suitability framework. The framework enables SEs to identify the most appropriate tool for their purpose and size to establish legitimacy through impact measurement and reporting.},

In particular, whereas digital innovation is able to drive an extraordinary development of entrepreneurial ventures, a number of challenging issues and the ongoing pandemic crisis have increased the need to investigate how technological breakthrough and human capital can be effectively combined in order to build resilient socio-technical and entrepreneurial ecosystems. This paper offers a synopsis of the major investigation areas and a reflec-tion on the themes associated with the emergence of a digital society and the affirmation of digital entrepreneurship ecosystems. The research process follows a systematic literature review and a conceptual development approach aimed to introduce both the concept and a model of the digital society “incubator”. The proposed model identifies the actors, values, flows, and processes that are required to support the construction of a resilient entrepreneurial ecosystem. In this perspective, the study proposes a new focus by hybridizing and integrating both entrepreneurial and technology-related dimensions into a single unifying model. The study also lays the groundwork for further studies aimed at identifying the environmental and institutional factors required to support a smooth and effective transition towards a resilient entrepreneurial and technology-driven society.},

When built in areas of poverty in cities of the Global South, these hubs cultivate entrepreneurialism and opportunities for profit at the intersection of development and technological innovation. They promise to address the social challenges of urban marginality with remunerative market solutions. In Cape Town, Africa's so-called Silicon Cape, the largest technology incubator of the city ventured into its most marginal township—Khayelitsha—in 2015, pledging to lay the infrastructural groundwork for fruitful entrepreneurial innovation. This article recollects, ethnographically, an important moment at the outset of this incubator: a fifty-four-hour franchised hackathon, Startup Weekend, which took place in September 2015 as an inaugural event. The argument of this article is that such an incubator was a sociotechnical formation meant to create the conditions for entrepreneurship in a deprived urban area, relying on a web of material and immaterial connections; that it materialized the rationalities of millennial development as well as alternative goals; and that, as infrastructure, it was patched with diverse aspirations and improvised forms of sociality. The article thus contributes to an urban geography of development that acknowledges its uncertainties and singularities as political openings.

Also, we explore how green finance policies resolve financing constraints of firms to green innovation. The capability of green innovation is found to be impaired when firms face higher financing constraints, and privately owned enterprises tend to be more vulnerable than state-owned ones in this regard. Although green finance policies can effectively ease financing restraints on green innovation overall, green credits are less likely to be available to privately owned enterprises. However, these enterprises which are deeply affected by financing constraints have relatively high innovation capabilities. We suggest the government to provide more supports to privately owned enterprises for investing in green projects. Further, both financial institutions and privately owned enterprises should be required to disclose more information on green credits and green projects, respectively. In addition, the China Banking Regulatory Commission should design a synthetic mechanism for evaluating green performance.},

Accordingly, a variety of policy initiatives are aimed at promoting the establishment, growth and impact of innovative start-ups. Designing such policies is a challenging task, because most start-ups fail. In addition, only a small share of those start-ups will ultimately prove to be innovative, and very few of those will eventually become high impact firms. Hence, effective policies require a better understanding of the processes by which innovative start-ups are formed, developed and create impact, as well as of the heterogeneous nature inherent to innovative start-ups along with their development trajectory. This article reviews 39 policy initiatives from around the world and classifies their approaches to the phenomenon of innovative start-ups. By relying on insights from the papers mentioned in this special issue, we develop a process framework by elaborating on (i) the antecedents of the creation of innovative start-ups, (ii) their founding characteristics, (iii) their behavior, and finally (iv) the outputs and impacts generated by them. Our framework highlights how policy initiatives, managerial issues and research approaches are conceptually different, depending on the specific stage of firm development.

We analyse regional and country level high‐growth start‐up rates across 24 OECD countries and 293 regions in the period 2001-13. We find that entrepreneurs perceive more stringent environmental policies as detrimental to starting a new venture, whereas the creation of new environmental knowledge in regions is highly correlated with the creation of green ventures but not fossil fuel ventures. We also find that gray entrepreneurs benefit marginally from the creation of new environmental knowledge, suggesting that entrepreneurs across sectors benefit from the implementation of eco-efficiency principles in the evaluation of new venture creation opportunities.},

A large sample of N = 2544 innovative Italian start-ups, of which 606 were incubated, was followed over a period of up to six years.

Findings also suggest that the initially negative effect of incubation on sales revenues turns into a positive effect in the long term. The effects of incubator characteristics, in terms of ownership, certification, and size on the growth of tenant start-ups were further analysed, but these effects were found to be negligible.

Based on a systematic literature review, this article outlines a framework that combines institutional modifications with technological innovation and infrastructure development as part of an economic development strategy. Important findings are that connections between innovation intermediaries, such as incubator and accelerator centers, niche actors, such as green champions, and regime actors, such as policy entrepreneurs, show potential to contribute to a green economic development strategy but require further examination for the specific roles played by policy entrepreneurs to help create the conditions for scaling niche experiments and simultaneously disrupting the regime. The key contribution is in defining the role of sustainability-oriented innovation intermediaries at linking local, state and business actions in order to scale-up and influence green economic development in a politically feasible manner during times of institutional uncertainty and instability.},

These projects, often labelled as “smart city” projects, are typically supported by municipalities, funded by subsidies, and run in partnerships. Many of the projects fade out after the pilot stage, and fail to generate scalable solutions that contribute to sustainable urban development. The lack of scaling is widely perceived as a major problem. In this paper, we analyze processes of upscaling, focusing on smart city pilot projects in which several partners—with different missions, agendas, and incentives—join up. We start with a literature review, in which we identify three types of upscaling: roll-out, expansion, and replication, each with its own dynamics and degree of context sensitivity. The typology is further specified in relation to several conditions and requirements that can impact upscaling processes, and illustrated by a descriptive analysis of three smart city pilot projects developed in Amsterdam. The paper ends with conclusions and recommendations on pilot projects and partnership governance, and adds new perspectives on the debate regarding upscaling.},

In particular, given that public value is rooted in democratic theory and new technologies that promote networking spaces have emerged, citizen participation represents one of the principal instruments to make government open and close to the citizenry needs. Participation in urban governance has undergone a great development: from the first postmodernist ideals of countering expert dominance to today's focus on learning and social innovation, where citizen participation is conceptualized as co-creation and co-production. Despite this development, there is a lack of research to know how this new governance context is taking place in the SC arena. Addressing this situation, in this article, we present an exhaustive survey of the research literature and a deep study of the experience in participative initiatives followed by SCs in Europe. Through an analysis of 149 SC initiatives from 76 European cities, we provide interesting insights about how participatory models have been introduced in the different areas and dimensions of the cities, how citizen engagement is promoted in SC initiatives, and whether the so-called creative SCs are those with a higher number of projects governed in a participatory way.},

abstract = {What are the challenges and opportunities involved in the development of circular-economy incubators in a developing economy? A grounded theory approach is used to explore these challenges and opportunities in Trinidad and Tobago. Local stakeholders, including entrepreneurs, non-profits, academics and government agencies, are interviewed and the results are analyzed via axial coding to extract trends in attitudes and perceptions. Two principal results emerge from the analysis: First, while government involvement was viewed as part of the process, stakeholders do not trust the government to lead the development. Second, many stakeholders do not fully understand circular-economy strategies and opportunities, emphasizing traditional waste management approaches such as recycling over value-added conversion of waste. Different stakeholders demonstrate different knowledge gaps, e.g. entrepreneurs tend not to recognize the financial case for circular economy, a prerequisite to their motivation to participate in incubation. These results suggest that circular-economy incubators would help entrepreneurs find and pursue circular-economy opportunities with a limited role for government. Also, education about circular-economy approaches is needed to motivate and inform participation in a circular-economy incubator.},

abstract = {The circular economy (CE), which reimagines waste as economic opportunity, has been largely overlooked by traditional entrepreneurs. One explanation for this oversight is that limited information flow and cognitive bias limit their ability to recognize and develop CE opportunities. We propose a framework for a CE-focused incubator that removes these barriers to circular economy entrepreneurship. The framework defines how multiple stakeholders interact in order to provide critical information for CE development. Stakeholders include firms seeking economical ways to handle waste, firms that might use waste as value-added input, government agencies, and circular economy analysts that can provide potentially beneficial information, e.g. via Material Flow Analysis. Entrepreneurs would be recruited to develop CE ventures. The government would be asked to support initial financing, but the final start-ups would stand on their own as enterprises worthy of venture capital funding. The collaborative environment would promote profitable CE behavior. CE entrepreneurs need access to relevant information and a supportive network, both of which the CE-focused incubator we propose provides. Future work is needed to implement CE-incubators to engage entrepreneurs to realize economic and environmental benefits.},

Measures to build an innovation-based economy are outlined. One such measure is the establishment of technology business incubators to nurture nascent ventures by providing focused counselling and facilitation services together with smart workspace and shared office facilities. An incubator, often sited within a technology park and affiliated to a technical university or research institute, provides a platform for convergence of support in a synergistic system. The state, business, venture capital and community each have special roles to play in stimulating the venture creation process. Examples are given of incubation arrangements in the USA and in China, Brazil and India — each customised to the local conditions and culture. The performance of this modality has now to be enhanced by identifying and applying good practices through systems of benchmarking and continuous learning. With some 3,500 incubators worldwide today, the need is felt — and the e-capability exists — to establish a virtual World Incubation Network.},

abstract = {The challenge to urban mobility arises from several intersecting trends: rapidly increasing urban populations; inadequate to non-existent infrastructure; ageing populations seeking to retain independent mobility, chiefly in the developed countries; and youthful populations seeking access to jobs, chiefly in the developing world. The consequences include: inferior service; wasted time from traffic congestion; pollution concentrated among dense populations, and inadequate vehicle parking. These challenges cannot be met by relying upon incremental improvements to the technologies and systems currently in place. Instead, radical entrepreneurial innovation must be allowed to offer disruptive improvements to the current mobility systems. However, singular innovations alone cannot unlock the full power of advanced technologies. In addition, large-scale, timely innovation will require ecosystem platforms to compete effectively with the incumbent business models and technologies. The most effective innovation ecosystems will find ways to include entrepreneurs in a predictable, systematic manner. Several kinds of kind of institutions can play a constructive role: governments at all levels to remove policy risk from the more customary risks to innovation; research universities through their teaching of innovation; entrepreneur support organizations; and, venture forums that connect startup companies to industry incumbents.},

abstract = {Building Smart City management concepts is based on the implementation and use of advanced technologies. The primary impulse for writing the article was the ambition to identify the current advanced technologies of Smart City management. The aim of the article is to propose a general model for the implementation of advanced technologies for Smart City management, based on the knowledge gained from the analysis of literature and case studies. In order to fulfill the set goal, it is necessary to obtain answers to two research questions. The findings were obtained through a secondary analysis of the literature, i.e., relevant articles from the scientific databases Web of Science and Scopus analysis of case studies of the best Smart Cities practices. According to the Smart City Index 2020 and IESE Cities in Motion, the leaders among the Smart Cities are Singapore and London, followed by Helsinki. In addition to the analyses, the article also uses methods of summarization, comparison, creativity, logic, induction and deduction. Smart Cities use 12 identified advanced technologies in their practice. Strategic management in Singapore, London and Helsinki adapts technology to the needs and requirements of its citizens, thus connecting the technological aspect with the managerial and social aspects. The contributions of the work include results for fellow researchers and a model for strategic management of new Smart Cities. The results of the article provide fellow researchers with the findings of a secondary analysis of relevant articles, from which they can draw when writing their own publications without the need for time-consuming search of the articles about this topic in databases. The general model of implementation of advanced technologies serves as a basis for strategic management of new Smart Cities that want to implement a technological base and at the same time do not want to forget the managerial and social aspects. Testing the model in practice with a new Slovak Smart City is part of future research activities.},

abstract = {Summary: While investments into renewable energy technologies are growing almost everywhere, the chances to meet ambitious emission and climate targets, as those envisaged in the Paris Agreement, are scant. To speed up the transition, policy makers need to design and implement a policy mix that could affect not just the quantity of green finance, but its quality as well. In this paper, we argue that a mission-oriented approach to the transition from an economy with high, to one with low greenhouse gas emissions, coupled with the state taking on the role of an entrepreneurial state, could provide an effective win-win strategy to address climate change concerns (embodied in emissions reduction and adaptation boosting) and build the basis for the next phase of growth and technological progress. In practice, this amounts to (i) abandoning the view that cost-internalization of environmental externalities would suffice to induce an effective transition (ii) developing a multi-level and cross-sectoral governance of the transition, with a clear direction in terms of the technological trajectory to favour, and (iii) designing a policy mix encompassing: fiscal instruments, targets and standards; public-private co-funding schemes; financial regulation; and disclosure practices. Social scientists should support such ambitious policy-design processes through adequate model development, where a combination of policies, and a directive role of the state, can be accommodated and examined in detail.},

However, none of the studies have examined how alignment with relevant sustainable development goals (SDGs) and leveraging technological innovations such as digital marketing can enhance the contribution of university business incubators and entrepreneurial training imparted at HEIs to encourage sustainable entrepreneurship. Since the entire world is focused on systematically pursuing SDGs to achieve the 2030 agenda envisioned by the United Nations, the present study posited that incubators and entrepreneurial training at HEI, which are aligned with pertinent SDGs and the latest technological innovations, would be more relevant in grooming future entrepreneurs skilled to contribute to the sustainability agenda. Thereby, it examined the key aspects of the entrepreneurship-SDGs-technology union in the higher education setting. Toward this end, open-ended essays were used to collect data from 38 start-up owners/partners/employees who have been associated with university business incubators recently or received entrepreneurial training at HEIs in the recent past. Content analysis of the qualitative data revealed the extent to which the existing incubators and entrepreneurial training at HEIs were aligned with SDGs 4, 9, 11, and 12. It also uncovered the perceptions of entrepreneurs about how HEIs were leveraging technological innovations such as digital marketing to create awareness about SDGs among the relevant stakeholders in the entrepreneurial ecosystem and to make entrepreneurial training and businesses more sustainability-oriented.},

Despite the popularity of incubators in the literature and practise, few studies have focused on sustainable incubators in general or, more specifically, on processes that ensure a steady flow of tenants. Thus, this paper investigates how sustainable incubators ensures their inflow of tenants, how they organize their activities and whether the incubator environment affect tenant recruitment. A case study approach analysing the sustainability oriented incubator Green Garage Berlin have been used to generate an understanding of selection and recruitment processes as well the influence of external environments. The results show that regional and inter-regional co-operation, together with a well-planned, structured pre-incubation process, are requirements for securing an inflow of tenants to sustainable incubators. Incubator reputation and sufficient long term funding is also a key to success. A good practice case as Green Garage cannot simply be replicated, but require openness to continue the learning process and adapting the knowledge to be transferred to local conditions.},

abstract = {Policymakers in developing countries increasingly see science, technology, and innovation (STI) as an avenue for meeting sustainable development goals (SDGs), with STI-based startups as a key part of these efforts. Market failures call for government interventions in supporting STI for SDGs and publicly-funded incubators can potentially fulfil this role. Using the specific case of India, we examine how publicly-funded incubators could contribute to strengthening STI-based entrepreneurship. India's STI policy and its links to societal goals span multiple decades—but since 2015 these goals became formally organized around the SDGs. We examine why STI-based incubators were created under different policy priorities before 2015, the role of public agencies in implementing these policies, and how some incubators were particularly effective in addressing the societal challenges that can now be mapped to SDGs. We find that effective incubation for supporting STI-based entrepreneurship to meet societal goals extended beyond traditional incubation activities. For STI-based incubators to be effective, policymakers must strengthen the ‘incubation system'. This involves incorporating targeted SDGs in specific incubator goals, promoting coordination between existing incubator programs, developing a performance monitoring system, and finally, extending extensive capacity building at multiple levels including for incubator managers and for broader STI in the country.},

The data are based on interviews with managers, stakeholders and tenants in Green Tech Park (Sweden), LADEC (Finland) and Green Garage (Germany). On average, the studied incubators had an ambition to recruit and develop sustainability-oriented start-ups, but the number of tenants must reach a critical mass if such ambitions are to become a reality. The local context influences this critical mass of start-ups and is a determining factor in generating (a) potential tenants and (b) the resources to support such firms. This suggests that incubator managers must actively seek tenants interested in sustainable entrepreneurship and that support must focus on activities in sustainability.},

abstract = {This article investigates the design and evolution of smart city platforms in the global south using the Indonesian cities of Jakarta and Surabaya as case studies. While smart city projects are often framed in generic rhetoric of efficiency and modernization, the concept was originally formulated for cities in developed countries, and therefore requires adjustment for the local conditions in the developing world. While the former can rely on established institutions and well-developed infrastructures, the latter are characterized by rapid urbanization, weaker institutions, a lack of resources and public services. Unlike their highly regulated counterparts, cities in the global south are shaped by a dynamic informal economy and practices of improvisation. Using the lens of organizational improvisation, this article investigates how urban platforms emerge, and how they adapt to improvisational practices in the administration and the urban population. The article investigates different types of urban data platforms and their relationship with the social practices of their users. With Indonesian Smart City initiatives in Jakarta and Surabaya as a case study, this article aims to identify the local needs that motivated these cities to develop their respective projects. The second question asks how smart city implementations respond and adapt to the specific local conditions and the improvisational practices of their users. Distinguishing three types of urban data platforms, the article characterizes specific processes of bricolage and argues for stronger consideration of processes of improvisation in the design of urban data platforms. The contribution is threefold. The article provides a framework based on improvisation and bricolage that allows the social dynamics around smart city platforms and their impact on the system to be differentiated. It provides lessons on how traditional smart city models need to be adapted for cities in emerging economies. Finally, it offers a critique of the platform metaphors that are normally taken for granted.},

This Review delves into the critical role played by Financial Technology (Fintech) in advancing environmental sustainability within smart city initiatives. Fintech innovations are instrumental in optimizing resource management, enhancing citizen engagement, and fostering collaborative governance models, thereby contributing to the overarching goal of creating sustainable urban ecosystems. Through a historical perspective, this Review traces the evolution of sustainable smart cities, highlighting the transformative impact of technological advancements and the integration of Fintech solutions. From early urban planning concepts to the emergence of smart technologies in the 21st century, the evolution of sustainable smart cities underscores the importance of leveraging innovation to address urban challenges. The rise of Fintech has further accelerated this evolution, offering innovative financial services tailored to support green finance, renewable energy investment, and sustainable infrastructure development. Fintech platforms enable efficient allocation of resources, facilitate transparent and secure transactions, and empower citizens to participate in sustainable initiatives. By integrating Fintech solutions into urban development strategies, cities can unlock new opportunities for environmental sustainability while fostering economic growth and social equity.  Looking ahead, the integration of sustainable smart cities and Fintech holds immense potential to address pressing environmental challenges such as climate change, pollution, and resource depletion. As cities continue to embrace digital transformation and adopt data-driven approaches, the role of Fintech in promoting environmental sustainability will become increasingly crucial. By leveraging historical insights and embracing emerging technologies, cities can chart a path towards a more resilient, inclusive, and environmentally sustainable future. This Review underscores the importance of collaboration among stakeholders, including governments, businesses, academia, and civil society, to drive collective action and accelerate the transition towards sustainable smart cities.

abstract = {Worldwide cities are involved in a digital transformation phase specially focused on sustainability and improving citizen's quality of life. However, such objectives are hard to achieve if the migration of the urban processes are not performed following a common approach. Under the paradigm of smart city, different Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have been deployed over urban environments to enable such digital transformation. However, actual implementations differ from one city to another, and even between services within the same city. As a consequence, the deployment of urban services is hindered, since they need to be tailored to each city. In addition, the isolation of urban services obstructs its optimization, since it cannot harness contextual information coming from other services. All in all, it is necessary to implement tools and mechanisms that allow us to ensure that city solutions and their vertical services are interoperable. In order to tackle this issue, different initiatives have proposed architectures that homogenize the interaction with smart cities from different angles. However, so far the compliance with such architectures has not been assessed. Having this in mind, in this work we present a validation framework, developed under the umbrella of the SynchroniCity project, which aims to verify that interfaces and data exposed by cities are aligned with the adopted standards and data models. In this regard, the validation framework presented here is the technical enabler for the creation of an interoperability certificate for smart cities. To assess the benefits of the validation framework, we have used it to check the interoperability of 21 smart city deployments worldwide that adhered the SynchroniCity guidelines. Afterwards, during an open call a total number of 37 services have been deployed over such SynchroniCity instances, thus confirming the goodness of uniform and validated smart cities to foster service replicability.},

abstract = {Urban Population is rapidly increasing, which is creating city management problems. The smart city provides solutions to the problems that are arising due to rapid urbanization. The smart city relies on Internet of Things IoT, Information and Communications Technology (ICT), smart computing technologies, and network technologies. IoT is used in every field such as smart transportation, smart grid, smart healthcare and smart buildings. IoT is a vast system embedded with smart devices, sensors, software, controllers, internet, and a cloud server. Therefore, this paper presents the concept of a smart city and the critical factors of a smart city initiative. Different domains that make up a smart city like smart health, smart buildings, smart transportation, and smart agriculture will be comprehensively discussed. This paper also highlights smart health applications and presents a patient status monitoring system that monitors patient's condition through video and speech. The role and implementation of smart city technology to minimize the COVID-19 risk will also be discussed. In this paper, overview of security for smart cities, existing security methods of authentication, and possible malicious attacks have also been discussed. Finally, this paper also focuses on multispectral imaging (MSG), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and the architecture of IoT applications in agriculture and greenhouse farms.},

abstract = {The concept of Smart City (SC) as a means to enhance the life quality of citizen has been gaining increasing importance in the agendas of policy makers. However, a shared definition of SC is not available and it is hard to identify common global trends. This paper provides with a comprehensive understanding of the notion of SC through the elaboration of a taxonomy of pertinent application domains, namely: natural resources and energy, transport and mobility, buildings, living, government, and economy and people. It also explores the diffusion of smart initiatives via an empirical study aimed at investigating the ratio of domains covered by a city's best practices to the total of potential domains of smart initiatives and at understanding the role that various economic, urban, demographic, and geographical variables might have in influencing the planning approach to create a smarter city. Results reveal that the evolution patterns of a SC highly depend on its local context factors. In particular, economic development and structural urban variables are likely to influence a city's digital path, the geographical location to affect the SC strategy, and density of population, with its associated congestion problems, might an important component to determine the routes for the SC implementation. This work provides policy makers and city managers with useful guidelines to define and drive their SC strategy and planning actions towards the most appropriate domains of implementation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The next trend of innovations is likely to come from humans' ability to connect to machines and the data that comes from these connections. The IBM Intelligent Operation Center (IOC) is a “system of systems” that is not intended to replace an existing physical infrastructure that gathers raw data. Instead, it is intended to extract only the data necessary to optimize the operations of the organization. The types of data and integration into the IOC make efficient problem solving solutions readily available to city authorities. The user interface and standard operating procedure and the resource processing capabilities of the IOC indicate that this system is optimal for smart cities of the future with regard to improvement of quality of life and ease of navigation. The need for smart cities, universities, campuses, citizens, and students to drive growth of urban and regional economies is evident. In this article, a thorough analysis of the architectural design of an intelligent operational system is completed to present a smart solution for cities to unify departments and agencies under one umbrella.},

abstract = {Purpose: Sustainability start-ups introduce business models that address current environmental and social challenges. However, to reach their mission, they need to integrate the intention of delivering such impact since their formulation. Business incubators show promise in supporting them in this process by enhancing their access to resources and knowledge during the early stage. For these reasons, this paper aims to investigate the transfer of knowledge in a support program, outlining what knowledge is transferred in the program and through which activities for encouraging the generation of sustainability start-ups' impact. Design/methodology/approach: The present paper is supported by a qualitative case study methodology based on primary data (interviews) and secondary data (internal and external documents) related to a French support program. Findings: The study shows that the support program transfers explicit and tacit knowledge for encouraging the generation of sustainability impact, throughout three main phases: awareness, identification and assessment. Research limitations/implications: The limitation concerns the analysis of a French support program and the focus on sustainability start-ups. Future research lines will study other and more traditional business incubators to confirm and possibly enrich the results. Practical implications: The study has managerial implications for incubator managers willing to support sustainable entrepreneurship and for sustainable entrepreneurs who want to find a support program and reach their impact. Social implications: The study shows that a sustainability orientation in business incubators can play a role in fostering sustainable development through the creation of new sustainability ventures. Originality/value: This paper contributes to two different fields: sustainable entrepreneurship support and knowledge management in incubators.},

The prospective society should be directed towards sustainable development, a process in which technology plays a crucial role. The proposed study discusses the technological potential for attaining the Sustainable Development Goals via disruptive technologies. This study further analyzes the outcome of disruptive technologies from the aspects of product development, health care transformation, a pandemic case study, nature-inclusive business models, smart cities and villages. These outcomes are mapped as a direct influence on Sustainable Development Goals 3, 8, 9 and 11. Various disruptive technologies and the ways in which the Sustainable Development Goals are influenced are elaborated. The investigation into the potential of disruptive technologies highlighted that Industry 5.0 and Society 5.0 are the most supportive development to underpin the efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. The study proposes the scenario where both Industry 5.0 and Society 5.0 are integrated to form smart cities and villages where the prospects of achieving Sustainable Development Goals are more favorable due to the integrated framework and Sustainable Development Goals' interactions. Furthermore, the study proposes an integrated framework for including new age technologies to establish the concepts of Industry 5.0 and Society 5.0 integrated into smart cities and villages. The corresponding influence on the Sustainable Development Goals are also mapped. A SWOT analysis is performed to assess the proposed integrated approach to achieve Sustainable Development Goals.

Despite the passage of nine years, tangible successes in achieving the SDGs have been limited, underscoring the critical need for innovative approaches to fostering energy performance and reducing carbon emissions. This study advocates for adopting circular economy principles as a strategic pathway to mitigate environmental, social, and economic challenges and promote sustainable, net-zero-energy solutions. Through a systematic literature review spanning multiple databases, this research underscores the synergy between urban circular economies (UCEs) and the SDGs, with a particular focus on sustainable solutions, resource use circularity in construction, and renewable energy integration. By setting stringent eligibility criteria, this review captures a wide array of perspectives, providing a comprehensive analysis that bridges the gap between urban sustainability, renewable energy adoption, and climate change mitigation efforts. The analysis of 23 selected papers reveals a substantial linkage between UCE practices and the advancement of SDGs, highlighting the pivotal roles of responsible consumption, resource efficiency, and regenerative practices in achieving co-benefits through policy and regulatory frameworks towards carbon neutrality. The findings recommend implementing a holistic approach that integrates urban sustainability with circular economy principles, offering a structured insight into the potential of UCEs in fostering a sustainable transition in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.},

abstract = {Despite serious efforts of the Lesotho Government, Lesotho Electricity Company (LEC) and other stakeholders, the level of rural household electrification and affordability are still low. Whereas in 2015 about 72% of urban households were grid-connected, this was only true for 5.5% of rural households. Furthermore, the vast majority of rural households use fuel wood, while electricity use, where available, represents a small share of the domestic energy consumption. The LEC data shows that the average consumption per household has decreased by over 60% between 2001 and 2016 in urban households. This indicates that the bulk of new connections are to the rural poor households. This is plausible given that majority of households perceive electricity and other commercial sources of energy to be more expensive than the traditional biomass. Therefore, the paper discusses this existing status quo with regard to rural electrification using data from the major players such as LEC, Rural Electrification Unit and Bureau of Statistics.},

abstract = {In this chapter, we assess how much research in South Africa has been directed towards biological invasions relative to other elements of global change. Using Web of Science, we systematically reviewed literature relevant to South African ecosystems published between 2000 and 2018 and relating to biological invasions, climate change, overharvesting, habitat change, pollution, and/or atmospheric CO2. We identified 1149 relevant papers that were scored in terms of their coverage of drivers and driver interactions that affect biodiversity or ecosystem services. A strong spatio-temporal effect was observed on research effort. Firstly, effort differed between realms, with habitat change, pollution and overharvesting receiving the largest research focus within terrestrial, freshwater and marine/estuarine realms respectively. Secondly, certain globally well-studied phenomena were not documented in local literature (e.g. there were fewer than five papers on ocean acidification). We identified 21 different interactions between drivers, with the interactions between invasive species and habitat change (for example altered fire regimes in invaded landscapes) being the most prominent. However, fewer than 4% of papers addressed interactions between three or more drivers. This suggests that while the importance of understanding driver interactions is recognised, there has been little in the way of researching the compound effects of driver interactions in South African ecosystems. The long-cited statement that invasive species pose the second-largest threat to biodiversity conservation, behind habitat change, matches the relative research output for this driver in South Africa. Developing a comprehensive quantitative picture of the relative importance of global change drivers will nonetheless be challenging, not only in the unambiguous delineation of drivers, but also due to the unequal availability of research results at comparable spatial and temporal scales. The relative maturity of work on invasive species could provide a basis for exploring such complex interactions and thus contribute to overcoming such barriers.},

abstract = {Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) are recognized as one of the leading bacterial causes of infantile diarrhea worldwide. Weaned C57BL/6 mice pretreated with antibiotics were challenged orally with wild-type EPEC or escN mutant (lacking type 3 secretion system) to determine colonization, inflammatory responses and clinical outcomes during infection. Antibiotic disruption of intestinal microbiota enabled efficient colonization by wild-type EPEC resulting in growth impairment and diarrhea. Increase in inflammatory biomarkers, chemokines, cellular recruitment and pro-inflammatory cytokines were observed in intestinal tissues. Metabolomic changes were also observed in EPEC infected mice with changes in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, increased creatine excretion and shifts in gut microbial metabolite levels. In addition, by 7 days after infection, although weights were recovering, EPEC-infected mice had increased intestinal permeability and decreased colonic claudin-1 levels. The escN mutant colonized the mice with no weight loss or increased inflammatory biomarkers, showing the importance of the T3SS in EPEC virulence in this model. In conclusion, a murine infection model treated with antibiotics has been developed to mimic clinical outcomes seen in children with EPEC infection and to examine potential roles of selected virulence traits. This model can help in further understanding mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of EPEC infections and potential outcomes and thus assist in the development of potential preventive or therapeutic interventions.},

We have systematically developed and extensively evaluated a procedure to extract total nucleic acids from used malaria RDTs. The co-extraction of DNA and RNA molecules from small volumes of dried blood retained on the RDTs allows detection and quantification of P. falciparum parasites from asymptomatic patients with parasite densities as low as 1 Pf/µL blood using reverse transcription quantitative PCR. Based on the extraction protocol we have developed the ENAR (Extraction of Nucleic Acids from RDTs) approach; a complete workflow for large-scale molecular malaria surveillance. Using RDTs collected during a malaria indicator survey we demonstrated that ENAR provides a powerful tool to analyze nucleic acids from thousands of RDTs in a standardized and high-throughput manner. We found several, known and new, non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in the propeller region of the kelch 13 gene among isolates circulating on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea.},

abstract = {Background: This paper enumerates and characterizes latent classes of adverse childhood experiences and investigates how they relate to prenatal substance use (i.e., smoking, alcohol, and other drugs) and poor infant outcomes (i.e., infant prematurity and low birthweight) across eight low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods: A total of 1189 mother-infant dyads from the Evidence for Better Lives Study cohort were recruited. Latent class analysis using the Bolck, Croon, and Hagenaars (BCH) 3-step method with auxiliary multilevel logistic regressions was performed. Results: Three high-risk classes and one low-risk class emerged: (1) highly maltreated (7%, n = 89), (2) emotionally and physically abused with intra-familial violence exposure (13%, n = 152), (3), emotionally abused (40%, n = 474), and (4) low household dysfunction and abuse (40%, n = 474). Pairwise comparisons between classes indicate higher probabilities of prenatal drug use in the highly maltreated and emotionally abused classes compared with the low household dysfunction and abuse class. Additionally, the emotionally and physically abused with intra-familial violence exposure class had higher probability of low birthweight than the three remaining classes. Conclusion: Our results highlight the multifaceted nature of ACEs and underline the potential importance of exposure to childhood adversities on behaviors and outcomes in the perinatal period. This can inform the design of antenatal support to better address these challenges.},

abstract = {Background: In low-income countries, like Malawi, important public health measures including social distancing or a lockdown have been challenging to implement owing to socioeconomic constraints, leading to predictions that the COVID-19 pandemic would progress rapidly. However, due to limited capacity to test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, there are no reliable estimates of the true burden of infection and death. We, therefore, conducted a SARS-CoV-2 serosurvey amongst health care workers (HCWs) in Blantyre city to estimate the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in urban Malawi. Methods: We recruited 500 otherwise asymptomatic HCWs from Blantyre City (Malawi) from 22nd May 2020 to 19th June 2020 and serum samples were collected from all participants. A commercial ELISA was used to measure SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in serum. Results: A total of 84 participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The HCWs with positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody results came from different parts of the city. The adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 12.3% [CI 8.2 - 16.5]. Using age-stratified infection fatality estimates reported from elsewhere, we found that at the observed adjusted seroprevalence, the number of predicted deaths was eight times the number of reported deaths. Conclusions: The high seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among HCWs and the discrepancy in the predicted versus reported deaths suggests that there was early exposure but slow progression of COVID-19 epidemic in urban Malawi. This highlights the urgent need for development of locally parameterised mathematical models to more accurately predict the trajectory of the epidemic in sub- Saharan Africa for better evidence-based policy decisions and public health response planning.},

abstract = {Background: HIV assays designed to detect recent infection, also known as "recency assays," are often used to estimate HIV incidence in a specific country, region, or subpopulation, alone or as part of recent infection testing algorithms (RITAs). Recently, many countries and organizations have become interested in using recency assays within case surveillance systems and routine HIV testing services to measure other indicators beyond incidence, generally referred to as "non-incidence surveillance use cases." Objective: This review aims to identify published evidence that can be used to validate methodological approaches to recency-based incidence estimation and non-incidence use cases. The evidence identified through this review will be used in the forthcoming technical guidance by the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) on the use of HIV recency assays for identification of epidemic trends, whether for HIV incidence estimation or non-incidence indicators of recency. Methods: To identify the best methodological and field implementation practices for the use of recency assays to estimate HIV incidence and trends in recent infections for specific populations or geographic areas, we conducted a systematic review of the literature to (1) understand the use of recency testing for surveillance in programmatic and laboratory settings, (2) review methodologies for implementing recency testing for both incidence estimation and non-incidence use cases, and (3) assess the field performance characteristics of commercially available recency assays. Results: Among the 167 documents included in the final review, 91 (54.5%) focused on assay or algorithm performance or methodological descriptions, with high-quality evidence of accurate age- and sex-disaggregated HIV incidence estimation at national or regional levels in general population settings, but not at finer geographic levels for prevention prioritization. The remaining 76 (45.5%) described the field use of incidence assays including field-derived incidence (n=45), non-incidence (n=25), and both incidence and non-incidence use cases (n=6). The field use of incidence assays included integrating RITAs into routine surveillance and assisting with molecular genetic analyses, but evidence was generally weaker or only reported on what was done, without validation data or findings related to effectiveness of using non-incidence indicators calculated through the use of recency assays as a proxy for HIV incidence. Conclusions: HIV recency assays have been widely validated for estimating HIV incidence in age- and sex-specific populations at national and subnational regional levels; however, there is a lack of evidence validating the accuracy and effectiveness of using recency assays to identify epidemic trends in non-incidence surveillance use cases. More research is needed to validate the use of recency assays within HIV testing services, to ensure findings can be accurately interpreted to guide prioritization of public health programming.},

abstract = {Increasing resources are being allocated both to the management and research of biological invasions in South Africa. However, as with many natural resource management and conservation programmes globally, the question remains as to what extent the science provides the necessary answers for management, and whether it influences decision-making. This frequently presents as a gap between knowledge generation and application of research outcomes (‘knowing-doing gap'). The ideal scenario, a two-way transfer of knowledge along a continuum between science and management (‘knowing-doing continuum'), would allow for dialogue between all role-players that will not only transfer research results in support of management, but communicate management needs to scientists. This chapter explores how well this continuum has operated in South Africa with regard to biological invasions. Professionals employed in different positions along a continuum of basic or applied research to technology transfer and implementation are currently assessed with different performance measures. This drives different behaviours, which in turn can impede smooth integration. To counteract this, different types of communication structures have been developed, although many have not persisted. The most successful and enduring appear to be voluntary forums or conference series where researchers and managers are regularly exposed to each other's challenges. Scientists who are embedded within management agencies (for example, Scientific Services units within national parks and provincial conservation agencies) appear to be well-placed to bridge the gaps that exist, but mechanisms to evolve into a true knowing-doing continuum still need to be sought for the South African context. To be more relevant, researchers need to draw on the experience of managers, better understand the context within which managers operate, and by which they are constrained, while policy-makers may have to become more willing to adapt approaches when research suggests that such changes would be warranted if certain goals are to be achieved.},

abstract = {Fish and other aquatic organisms have been introduced into new environments for various reasons. Provision of sports fishery, supplemental to stocks, to fill empty niches, control weeds, and disease vectors and even create a commercial fishery are some of the reasons why fish species are introduced into new ecosystems. Lake Victoria and Lake Naivasha in Kenya have seen several introductions as discussed in this paper. In Lake Victoria for example, some of the species introduced include Nile perch, Lates niloticus, Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, Tilapia zilii, and Oreochromis esclentus among others. The most successful introductions have been that of the Nile perch, Nile tilapia and water hyacinth. Lake Naivasha too has witnessed a number of introductions into its fisheries too. Some of the successful introductions into the lake are those of the Common carp, Cyprinus carpio, the largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, the Nile tilapia, O. niloticus and Louisiana red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkia. Aside from the fish species mentioned, some invasive plant species have also been introduced into these two lake ecosystems. Of notable success and impacts have been the water hyacinth, Eichhornia crassipes and Nile cabbage, Pistia stratiotes. These introductions have had both negative and positive impacts on the fisheries and the ecology of the two lakes. Some of the impacts have been predation on the native species by the introduced species like in the case of Nile perch and largemouth bass in Lake Victoria and Naivasha respectively. Competition for resources and hybridization with the native species has also been witnessed in the case of the tilapiines in the two lakes with undesirable results. Blockage of navigation routes caused by the invasive plants has been a major problem in the two lakes sometimes leading to massive postharvest losses by the fishermen. On the other hand, some introduced species have led to an increase in fish landings as well as utilization of the niches that were initially vacant within these ecosystems. It can therefore be concluded that introduced species often have more negative effects on the native species and therefore such introductions should be based on sound scientific research in order to minimize their effects within the new environments.},

It is made available under a CC-BY 4.0 International license.  Background Brucellosis is a highly contagious zoonosis affecting human and almost all domestic species. It is a multi-burdens disease leading to severe economic losses due to disability in humans in addition to abortion, infertility and reduced milk production in animals. An Important element for effective prevention and control of brucellosis is to improve knowledge, attitude and practices of the community. Objective(s) This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) related to brucellosis at human-animal interface and to determine the risk factors for human infection in the Nile Delta, Egypt. Methods A matched case-control study was conducted at the main fever hospitals located in 6 governorates in the Nile Delta, Egypt between June 2014 and June 2016. Face-to-face interviews with cases and controls was done using a structured questionnaire. Differences in proportions of KAP variables among the cases and controls were evaluated by Pearson's Chi square test and a p value <0.05 was set as a level of significance. A multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis was built to determine the risk factors for Brucella spp. infection among study participants. Results A total of 217 cases and 434 controls matched for age, gender and sociodemographic characteristics were enrolled and interviewed. In total, 40.7% of the participants owned animals in their households and lived in shared accommodation with animals [48.8% of cases vs 36.9% of controls; (p= 0.003)]. The majority (78.1%) used to accommodate cows and buffaloes with sheep and goats. Human brucellosis cases experienced more animal abortions comparing to the controls [(23.5% vs 9.7%, respectively), (p= 0.0003)]. The majority of the participants (82.4%) did not notify authorities in case that abortion occurs in their owned animals. Apparently, 67.4% of the participants [(70.0% of the cases vs 66.1% of the controls) (p = 0.315)] had not ever heard about brucellosis. The overall mean practice score regarding animal husbandry, processing and consumption of milk and dairy products was significantly lower among cases comparing to controls (−12.7±18.1 vs 0.68±14.2 respectively; p<0.0001). Perceived barrier for notification of animal infection and/or abortion was significantly higher among cases (p= 0.034) and positively correlated with participants' education. Results of univariate analysis showed that participants who have animals' especially small ruminates were at a higher risk of getting Brucella spp. infection than others. In the proposed multivariate conditional logistic regression model, the predictors of having brucellosis infection were consumption of unpasteurized milk, having consumed dairy products in the last 3 months before the study, consumption of yoghurt or home-made cheeses and involvement in contact with animals [OR (95% CI) = 4.12 (1.62 - 10.75); 2.71 (1.06 – 6.93); 2.51 (1.21 – 5.24); 1.96 (1.17- 3.30), p<0.05; and 4.97 (2.84 - 8.72)], respectively. Participants who take more protective measures against infection were at a significant lower risk of being diseased with brucellosis; [OR (95% CI) = 0.23 (0.10 - 0.58); p<0.001], respectively. A model predicting risk factors for brucellosis among those who own animal showed that frequent abortions per animal increased the chance for brucellosis infection among human cases by 49.33 fold [(95% CI)= (8.79 – 276.91); p= 0.001] whereas the practice protective measures with animals was protective for humans as well [OR (95% CI)= 0.11 (0.03-0.45); p= 0.002]. Conclusion Consumption of dairy products stands side by side with the contact with infected animals particularly aborted ones as the major risk factors for Brucella spp. infection among humans in Egypt. On the other hand, there is a poor knowledge, negative attitudes and risky behaviors among villagers which increase the magnitude of the risk of brucellosis transmission at the human-animal interface. This supports the need for integrating health education in the national brucellosis control programs in Egypt with a special emphasis on hygienic animal husbandry, disease notification and benefits of animal vaccination. Author summary Zoonotic brucellosis has a vast global burden and remains neglected in many areas of the world despite notable advances in disease containment strategies. Despite the implementation of a national brucellosis control program in Egypt, the challenges for the disease eradication are intractable and multifaceted. We modeled in the present study the multivariate factors for brucellosis persistence in Egypt which apparently pointed to lack of basic understanding of the nature of brucellosis, traditional practices, beliefs and risky behaviors being undertaken on farms and at households across a wide region of the country. Predominantly, consumption of dairy products from unregulated sources; underreporting animal infection and abortion; underutilization of animal vaccination service; unsanitary disposal of abortus; use of milk of infected/aborted ruminants and lack of protective measure when practicing animal husbandry. Together, these conflict with disease intervention strategies and contribute to disease spread and re-emergence. The proposed model can provide a framework for future containment strategies that should be adopted to support and enhance the adherence to the current national brucellosis control program.},

The bone is dated approximately 20,000BC.Key to the demonstration of the sieve is the contention that the ancient Stone Agemathematicians of Ishango in Central Africa conceived of doubling or multiplication by 2in a more primitive mode than modern Computer Age humans, as the process of"copying" of a singular record (that is, a mark created by a stone tool as encountered inStone Age people's daily experience). Similarly, the doubling of any number was, bylogical extension, a process of copying of any number of records (marks) denoting aninteger, thereby doubling the exhibited number (marks). Some evidence for this processof "copying" and thus representing numbers as consisting of "copies" of other numbers,is displayed on the bone and can still be found to exist in the number systems ofmodern Africans in the region.Unlike previous speculations on the use of the bone tool by other studies, the ancientmethod of sieving of the small primes suggested here is notable for unifying (making useand explanation of) all columns of the Ishango bone; whilst all numbers exhibited forman essential part of the primitive mathematical sieve described. Furthermore, it is statedthat the middle column (M) of the bone inscriptions houses the calculations of theIshango Sieve. All numbers deduced in the middle calculation column relate to aprocess of elimination of the non-prime numbers from the sequence of numbers1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 (although numbers 1 and 2 are omitted). The act of elimination isproven by the display of the numbers deduced in the middle column; namely: 4, 6, 8, 9,and 10 and the subsequent omission of these same numbers from the following listleaving only: 5, 7 at the bottom of column M.This elimination process described above is repeated to obtain the primes 11,13,17,19when eliminating non-primes from the sequence 11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20.However, only calculations for the sequence 1 to 10 (for numbers above 2) aredisplayed in column M; as if to exemplify the Ishango Sieve method for the benefit ofposterity.},

Methods: We report observational data from a real world cross-sectional cohort of 115 adults with chronic hepatitis B infection (CHB), at a university hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. HIV coinfection was present in 39 (34%) subjects. We recorded cross-sectional demographic, clinical and laboratory data. Results: Compared to those with HIV coinfection, HBV monoinfected adults were less likely to be HBeAg-positive (p=0.01), less likely to have had assessment with elastography (p<0.0001), and less likely to be on antiviral treatment (p<0.0001); they were more likely to have detectable HBV viraemia (p=0.04), and more likely to have features of liver disease including moderate/severe thrombocytopaenia (p=0.007), elevated bilirubin (p=0.004), and elevated APRI score (p=0.02).

abstract = {Human genetic studies have long been vastly Eurocentric, raising a key question about the generalizability of these study findings to other populations. Because humans originated in Africa, these populations retain more genetic diversity, and yet individuals of African descent have been tremendously underrepresented in genetic studies. The diversity in Africa affords ample opportunities to improve fine-mapping resolution for associated loci, discover novel genetic associations with phenotypes, build more generalizable genetic risk prediction models, and better understand the genetic architecture of complex traits and diseases subject to varying environmental pressures. Thus, it is both ethically and scientifically imperative that geneticists globally surmount challenges that have limited progress in African genetic studies to date. Additionally, African investigators need to be meaningfully included, as greater inclusivity and enhanced research capacity afford enormous opportunities to accelerate genomic discoveries that translate more effectively to all populations. We review the advantages, challenges, and examples of genetic architecture studies of complex traits and diseases in Africa. For example, with greater genetic diversity comes greater ancestral heterogeneity; this higher level of understudied diversity can yield novel genetic findings, but some methods that assume homogeneous population structure and work well in European populations may work less well in the presence of greater heterogeneity in African populations. Consequently, we advocate for methodological development that will accelerate studies important for all populations, especially those currently underrepresented in genetics.},

Cyanobacteria have been reported in Lake Victoria, which is an important source of drinking water for the riparian communities, thus posing a danger to human health. However, the health risk from exposure to toxic cyanobacteria in the Nyanza Gulf water remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to assess the health risk of toxic cyanobacteria to the riparian communities in the Nyanza Gulf. In a longitudinal study adopting survey and experimental design, 127 samples were collected monthly from both households and six beaches over six months. Cyanobacterial levels were determined using an enzyme assay method (PP2A). Different methods of household water treatment were compared. Two-way ANOVA was done to determine statistical significance of microcystins levels. 84% of water samples contained microcystins. Concentration of microcystins was 3.44g/L which is over the WHO limit of 1g/L. There was no variation between beaches and water treatment (ANOVA: F=0.97, p=0.47). Filtration proved to be the most efficient method of water treatment. The health risk factor of cyanotoxins in drinking water is 3.86. There is a health risk posed by cyanotoxins to the residents of the Nyanza Gulf who use the lake water for drinking since is over the WHO limit. This information provides an insight into the quality of Lake Victoria water for drinking. The study recommends development of cyanobacteria removal methods as well as sensitizing the riparian communities on the health risk of cyanotoxins in drinking water.},

abstract = {Her work focuses on innovation dynamics in global health challenges (such as tuberculosis) and on the sociology of diagnostics and innovations at the point-of-care in India and South Africa. She has done extensive fieldwork in India and South Africa, among others on challenges to point of care testing across different settings, diseases and actor groups. Abstract: Point of care (POC) testing in communities, home settings and primary healthcare centers are believed to have tremendous potential in reducing delays in diagnosing and initiating treatment for diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, syphilis and malaria. Quick diagnosis and further management decisions completed in the same clinical encounter or at least the same day, while the patient waits, promise to overcome delays associated with conventional laboratory-based testing. However, the availability of cheap, simple and rapid tests that can be conducted outside laboratories does not automatically ensure successful POC testing. In order to understand the new roles and challenges medical devices such as these encounter, we need to study how tests are used at the POC and integrated into workflow and patient pathways. This chapter reviews selected results from a qualitative research project on barriers to point of care testing in India and South Africa and discusses them comparatively. The project used semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions to examine diagnostic practices across major diseases and actors in homes, clinics, communities, hospitals and laboratories in South Africa and India. In comparing selected results, it becomes clear that both countries have very different diagnostic eco-systems that provide very different conditions for POC testing. The paper concludes by reflecting on how to take such insights into account when designing POC testing programs.},

abstract = {Maternal nutrition is a key factor influencing optimal birth and child developmental outcomes. Although this is recognized globally, it is particularly relevant to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where the risk of malnutrition during pregnancy is high, and low birth weight (LBW) is prevalent. LBW has consistently been associated with poor health, stunted growth, and adverse neurocognitive outcomes. Less is known about the impact of maternal nutrition and LBW on neurodevelopment due to the limited focus of neuroimaging research on maternal obesity and pre-term birth in high-income countries. Maternal nutrition may be pivotal to understanding how LBW impacts the child brain in LMICs where there is a high risk of food insecurity and approximately 43% of children under the age of 5 are at risk of not reaching their developmental potential. Furthermore, examining the outcomes of LBW in babies who are small-for-gestational age (SGA) due to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) in LMICs is less-explored, yet important. Therefore, further neuroimaging research is needed to investigate the complex relationship between maternal nutrition, LBW and structural brain outcomes. This should be recognized as a research priority to inform nutritional interventions during pregnancy, and to optimize the developmental potential of children from LMICs.},

abstract = {This paper offers an overview of how climate change is already affecting farmers across eastern and southern Africa, and how it will continue to affect them in the future. The rising temperatures and increased rainfall variability associated with climate change are undermining the livelihoods and food security of Africa's farmers, most of whom work at a subsistence level and also face problems of poverty, inadequate infrastructure and poor governance. To address these problems, governments and development organizations have promoted climate-smart agriculture (CSA). These projects, however, have been constrained by inadequate data and predictions regarding future climate change. In particular, farmers in Africa need better projections of the climate hazards for specific regions. Historical weather data at the local level contains many gaps, and the continuing collection of such data could be much improved. Strengthening the database of observed weather is critical to understanding the changes that have occurred already, to project future changes, and to plan appropriately to address them. Once collected and analyzed, climate data must be communicated in ways that help decision-makers understand climate impacts. Good tools are available---such as ClimateWizard.org and Servir ClimateServ---but practitioners at the local level must have the access and training to use them. Even in places where projections are uncertain, steps can be taken now to implement CSA practices and make farmers more resilient in the face of climate change.},

abstract = {The emergence and fast global spread of COVID-19 has presented one of the greatest public health challenges in modern times with no proven cure or vaccine. Africa is still early in this epidemic, therefore the extent of disease severity is not yet clear. We used a mathematical model to fit to the observed cases of COVID-19 in South Africa to estimate the basic reproductive number and critical vaccination coverage to control the disease for different hypothetical vaccine efficacy scenarios. We also estimated the percentage reduction in effective contacts due to the social distancing measures implemented. Early model estimates show that COVID-19 outbreak in South Africa had a basic reproductive number of 2.95 (95% credible interval [CrI] 2.83-3.33). A vaccine with 70% efficacy had the capacity to contain COVID-19 outbreak but at very higher vaccination coverage 94.44% (95% Crl 92.44-99.92%) with a vaccine of 100% efficacy requiring 66.10% (95% Crl 64.72-69.95%) coverage. Social distancing measures put in place have so far reduced the number of social contacts by 80.31% (95% Crl 79.76-80.85%). These findings suggest that a highly efficacious vaccine would have been required to contain COVID-19 in South Africa. Therefore, the current social distancing measures to reduce contacts will remain key in controlling the infection in the absence of vaccines and other therapeutics.},

abstract = {Studies of non-linguistic statistical learning (SL) have often linked performance in SL tasks with differences in language outcomes. Most of these studies have focused on Western and high-income educational contexts, but children worldwide learn in radically different educational systems and communities, and often in a second language. In the west African nation of C{\^{o}}te d'Ivoire, children enter fifth grade (CM-1) with widely varying ages and literacy skills. Across three iteratively-developed experiments, 157 children, age 8-15 years, in rural communities in the greater-Adz{\'{o}}pe region of C{\^{o}}te d'Ivoire watched sequences of cartoon images with embedded triplet patterns on touchscreen tablets, while performing a target-detection task. We assessed these tablet-based adaptations of non-linguistic visual SL and asked whether the children's individual differences in performance on the SL tasks were related to their first and second language and literacy skills. We found group-level evidence that children used the statistical regularities in the image sequence to gradually decrease their response times, but their responses on post-test discrimination did not reflect this learning. When evaluating the correlation between SL and language skills, individual differences related to other task demands predicted oral language skills shared by first and second languages, while SL better predicted second language print skills. These findings suggest that non-linguistic SL paradigms can measure similar skills in Ivorian children as previous samples, but they also echo recent calls for further cross-cultural validation, greater internal reliability, and tests for confounding variables (such as processing speed) in studies of individual differences in statistical learning.},

abstract = {Background: Emerging data from Africa indicates remarkably low numbers of reported COVID-19 deaths despite high levels of disease transmission. However, evolution of these trends as the pandemic progresses remains unknown. More certain are the devastating longterm impacts of the pandemic on health and development evident globally. Research tailored to the unique needs of African countries is crucial. UKCDR and GloPID-R have launched a tracker of funded COVID-19 projects mapped to the WHO research priorities and research priorities of Africa and less-resourced countries and published a baseline analysis of a living systematic review (LSR) of these projects. Methods: In-depth analyses of the baseline LSR for COVID-19 funded research projects in Africa (as of 15th July 2020) to determine the funding landscape and alignment of the projects to research priorities of relevance to Africa. Results: The limited COVID-19 related research across Africa appears to be supported mainly by international funding, especially from Europe, although with notably limited funding from United Statesbased funders. At the time of this analysis no research projects funded by an African-based funder were identified in the tracker although there are several active funding calls geared at research in Africa and there may be funding data that has not been made publicly available. Many projects mapped to the WHO research priorities and five particular gaps in research funding were identified, namely: investigating the role of children in COVID-19 transmission; effective modes of community engagement; health systems research; communication of uncertainties surrounding mother-to-child transmission of COVID-19; and identifying ways to promote international cooperation. Capacity strengthening was identified as a dominant theme in funded research project plans. Conclusions: We found significantly lower funding investments in COVID-19 research in Africa compared to high-income countries, seven months into the pandemic, indicating a paucity of research targeting the research priorities of relevance to Africa.},

abstract = {Insecticide resistance genes are often associated with pleiotropic effects on various mosquito life-history traits. However, very little information is available on the impact of insecticide resistance on blood feeding process in mosquitoes. Here, using two recently detected DNA-based metabolic markers in the major malaria vector, An. funestus, we investigated how metabolic resistance genes could affect the blood meal intake. After allowing both the field F1 and lab F8 Anopheles funestus strains to feed on the human arm for 30 minutes, we assessed the association between key parameters of blood meal process including, probing time, feeding duration, blood feeding success, blood meal size, and markers of glutathione S-transferase (L119F-GSTe2) and cytochrome P450 (CYP6P9a_R)-mediated metabolic resistance. None of the parameters of blood meal process was associated with L119FGSTe2 genotypes. By contrast, for CYP6P9a_R, homozygous resistant mosquitoes were significantly more able to blood-feed than homozygous susceptible (OR = 3.3; CI 95%: 1.4-7.7; P = 0.01) mosquitoes. Moreover, the volume of blood meal ingested by CYP6P9a-SS mosquitoes was lower than that of CYP6P9a-RS (P<0.004) and of CYP6P9a-RR (P<0.006). This suggests that CYP6P9a gene is inked with the feeding success and blood meal size of An. funestus. However, no correlation was found in the expression of CYP6P9a and that of genes encoding for salivary proteins involved in blood meal process. This study suggests that P450-based metabolic resistance may influence the blood feeding process of Anopheles funestus mosquito and consequently its ability to transmit malaria parasites.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Invasive cervical cancer (ICC) is preventable and curable. However, it is the fourth leading cause of cancer mortality among women globally, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Whereas studies reveal the existence of ICC pre-cancerous lesion screening services in Kenya and Uganda, uptake of these services remains low, highlighting the existence of unidentified barriers. This study explored factors that impede access and utilization of pre-cancerous cervical screening services among women living with HIV in low resource settings in Uganda and Kenya. METHODS: a cross-sectional study design was used in six selected health facilities in Uganda and Kenya. A systematic cluster randomized sampling was used to select health facilities for women living with HIV who were invited to participate in the interviews. Data collection, coding, categorization, and statistical analysis of quantitative data were employed to rank and correlate among the most critical factors of the Health Belief Model framework. RESULTS: the results showed a negative correlation between the perceived barriers and the risk of accessing the services (-0.95, p-value 0.003) and the perceived severity (-0.95, p-value 0.004), both mean that the barriers for the women are so high that they prefer to delay the visit to the hospital. More, there was a positive correlation between perceived risk for ICC and perceived severity (0.90, p-value 0.01), meaning that a high perception of risk of ICC will increase its severity. Health system barriers to access such as lack of supplies, information, and limited staffing were also revealed. CONCLUSION: the study uncovered the health system barriers affecting ICC screening services at health facilities in Kenya and Uganda and their effects on the perceived illness. Also, it highlights the strengths and challenges while providing recommendations to promote health that includes the most vulnerable women with HIV living in socially deprived areas.},

abstract = {Alternative fuels available at low cost, friendly to natural environments and meet the energy needs and demands, have witnessed a growing demand and use today. Ethanol is an attractive renewable energy source with a high content of oxygen. Ethanol can be produced through ethanolisis, however for this work direct blending of conventional diesel, waste plastic pyrolysis oil and ethanol with commercial fuel improver CI-0808 purchased from Innospec company was attempted. The primary purpose of adding a cetane improver was to improve the combustion characteristics of the blends by at least 1- 3 ignition quality points. Five mixing ratios were chosen in the following order, 50:25:25, 60: 20:20, 70: 15:15, 80: 10:10 and 90: 5:5 for Waste Plastic Pyrolysis Oil (WPPO), ethanol and conventional diesel (CD) respectively. However, for the fuel additive mixing ratio the total volume percentage was considered and the ratio put at 0.01% of the total quantity of blended fuel. In this work WPPO, diesel blends and fuel additives improvers were used as alternative fuel. This was to evaluate their performance and emission characteristics in a stationary single cylinder water cooled experimental diesel engine. The CI-0808 was added due to its potential power to reduce emissions of CO, UHC, NOX, PM and improved engine performance. The results obtained were compared carefully to ASTM standards and discussed using graph curves figures and tabulated values. The conclusion was that ethanol and WPPO blends can be used in diesel engines as alternative fuel without modification. Used in combination with cetane improvers the emissions reduce significantly and performance improved equalling that of conventional diesel fuel.},

We hypothesized that plasma rifampicin exposures would be similar between oral dosing of 35 mg/kg of body weight and intravenous dosing of 20 mg/kg, which has been proposed for efficacy trials in tuberculous meningitis. We performed a randomized parallel-group pharmacokinetic study nested within a clinical trial of intensified antimicrobial therapy for tuberculous meningitis. HIV-positive participants with tuberculous meningitis were recruited from South African hospitals and randomized to one of three rifampicin dosing groups: standard (oral 10 mg/kg), high dose (oral 35 mg/kg), and intravenous (20 mg/kg). Intensive pharmacokinetic sampling was done on day 3. Data were described using noncompartmental analysis, and exposures were compared by geometric mean ratios (GMRs). Forty-six participants underwent pharmacokinetic sampling (standard dose, n = 17; high-dose oral, n = 15; intravenous, n = 14). The median CD4 count was 130 cells/mm3 (interquartile range [IQR], 66 to 253 cells/mm3). The rifampicin geometric mean area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC0–24) values were 42.9 mg {\textperiodcentered} h/ml (95% confidence interval [CI], 24.5 to 75.0 mg {\textperiodcentered} h/ml) for the standard dose, 295.2 mg {\textperiodcentered} h/ml (95% CI, 189.9 to 458.8 mg {\textperiodcentered} h/ml) for the high oral dose, and 206.5 mg {\textperiodcentered} h/ml (95% CI, 154.6 to 275.8 mg {\textperiodcentered} h/ml) for intravenous administration. The rifampicin AUC0–24 GMR was 1.44 (90% CI, 0.84 to 2.21) and the maximal concentration of drug in serum (Cmax) GMR was 0.89 (90% CI, 0.63 to 1.23) for high-dose oral administration with respect to intravenous dosing. The plasma rifampicin AUC0–24 was higher after an oral 35-mg/kg dose than with intravenous administration at a 20-mg/kg dose over the first few days of tuberculosis (TB) treatment. The findings support oral rifampicin dosing in future tuberculous meningitis trials.},

abstract = {Background. A new endemic disease has spread across Wuhan City, China, in December 2019. Within few weeks, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a novel coronavirus designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In late January 2020, WHO declared the outbreak of a "public-health emergency of international concern" due to the rapid and increasing spread of the disease worldwide. Currently, there is no vaccine or approved treatment for this emerging infection; thus, the objective of this study is to design a multiepitope peptide vaccine against COVID-19 using an immunoinformatics approach. Method. Several techniques facilitating the combination of the immunoinformatics approach and comparative genomic approach were used in order to determine the potential peptides for designing the T-cell epitope-based peptide vaccine using the envelope protein of 2019-nCoV as a target. Results. Extensive mutations, insertion, and deletion were discovered with comparative sequencing in the COVID-19 strain. Additionally, ten peptides binding to MHC class I and MHC class II were found to be promising candidates for vaccine design with adequate world population coverage of 88.5% and 99.99%, respectively. Conclusion. The T-cell epitope-based peptide vaccine was designed for COVID-19 using the envelope protein as an immunogenic target. Nevertheless, the proposed vaccine rapidly needs to be validated clinically in order to ensure its safety and immunogenic profile to help stop this epidemic before it leads to devastating global outbreaks.},

This review is aimed to indicate the prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni among children at the national and regional levels. Methods and material: The PRISMA guidelines were followed. An electronic search of PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, MEDLINE, and Google search were carried out using key terms. Articles published from the proceeding of professional associations such as the Ethiopian medical laboratory association, the Ethiopian public health association, and annual national research conferences were also searched to find additional eligible studies. Data were extracted independently by two investigators, and cross-checked by a third reviewer. The quality of included studies was assessed using JBI quality assessment criteria. Data were extracted using Microsoft excel and finally analyzed using STATA version 12. The pooled prevalence was done using a random-effects model. Result: Overall 49 studies involving 20,493 children (10,572 male and 9, 921 females) were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni infection was 37.13% (95%CI:30.02–44.24). High heterogeneity was observed with I2 of 99.4%, P < 0.000. According to subgroup analysis, the pooled prevalence was high in the SNNPR (41.49%: 95%CI: 19.52–63.46) followed by the Amhara region (41.11%: 95%CI: 30.41–51.8), the Tigray region (31.40%: 95%CI:11.72–51.09), and the Oromia region (28.98%: 95%CI: 18.85–39.1). Year from 2011 to 2015 contributed to the highest prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni infection among children (46.31%: 95%:34.21–59.05). Conclusion: This study revealed a 37.13% prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni infection among children. This is an alert to improve and implement appropriate control strategies such as mass drug administration in Ethiopia.},

abstract = {This study identifies and describes the problems of teaching and learning of the Igbo language at Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University, Nigeria. In the last two decades, it has been observed that there has been a substantial decrease in the proportion of students who applied for or even enrolled to study the Igbo language at university level in Nigeria. Using survey design, this study investigated the problems associated with the teaching and learning of the Igbo language. Fifteen Igbo language students and four Igbo language lecturers at Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University, Igbariam campus were used to obtain information. Two instruments were administered on participants selected for the study. Results indicate that lack of Igbo pedagogical materials, attitude of people towards the language among other things prevent the smooth teaching and learning of the Igbo language. The paper concludes that although efforts are made by scholars to revitalize and popularize the study of Igbo language, interest and enrolment among prospective students are still very low.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The Bamenda, Santa and Tiko Health Districts are in the highest malaria transmission strata of Cameroon. The purpose of this study was to explore the indicators of ownership and utilisation as well as maintenance of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) in three health districts in Cameroon. METHODS: A cross-sectional household survey involving 1,251 households was conducted in the Tiko Health District (THD) in June and July 2017 and in Bamenda and Santa Health Districts in March to May 2018. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data on LLIN ownership, utilisation, and maintenance as well as demographic characteristics. RESULTS: The average number of LLINs per household was higher in the Bamenda Health District (BHD) compared to the THD (2.5, range; 0 – 6 vs. 2.4, range; 0 – 6) as well as the household ownership of at least one LLIN (93.3% vs. 89.0%). The proportion of the defacto population with universal utilisation was higher in BHD compared to THD (13.1% vs 0.2%). In the multinomial regression analysis, households in the SHD (p = 5.5x10-4, OR; 0.3, 95% C.I; 0.1 – 0.6), were less likely to own at least one LLIN compared to those in THD. 87.1% of household heads admitted that LLINs could be washed, while 50.1% affirmed the correct washing frequency. CONCLUSION: Ownership of LLINs was low in the THD in comparison to the goal of one for every two household members. Overall, LLINs coverage and accessibility was still low after the free mass distribution campaigns (MDCs), as only 14.6% of children 0 – 5 years and 16.1% of the entire population used LLIN the night before the survey.},

abstract = {Background: Evidence from observational studies suggests that chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is associated with extrahepatic cancers. However, the causal association between chronic HBV infection and extrahepatic cancers remains to be determined. Methods: We performed two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate whether chronic HBV infection is causally associated with extrahepatic cancers. We identified four independent genetic variants strongly associated (P-value < 5 × 10−8) with the exposure, chronic HBV infection in 1371 cases and 2938 controls of East Asian ancestry in Korea, which were used as instrumental variables. Genome-wide association summary level data for outcome variables, that included cancer of the biliary tract, cervix, colorectum, endometrium, esophagus, gastric, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung, ovary and pancreas were obtained from Biobank Japan. Findings: Using the multivariable inverse variance weighted method, we found genetic liability to chronic HBV infection causally associated with extrahepatic cancers including cervical cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 1.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.29–1.91, P-value = 0.0001) and gastric cancer (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.05–1.19, P-value = 0.0001). Moreover, chronic HBV infection (OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.07–1.34, P-value = 0.0021) was causally associated with hepatocellular carcinoma, supporting a well-established association between chronic HBV infection and hepatocellular carcinoma. Interpretation:: Our MR analysis revealed that chronic HBV infection is causally associated with extrahepatic cancers including cervical and gastric cancers. Funding: None.},

abstract = {Introduction: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a CD4 cell count before starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) to detect advanced HIV disease, and routine viral load (VL) testing following ART initiation to detect treatment failure. Donor support for CD4 testing has declined to prioritize access to VL monitoring. We examined trends in CD4 and VL testing among adults (≥15 years of age) starting ART in Southern Africa. Methods: We analysed data from 14 HIV treatment programmes in Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe in 2005 to 2018. We examined the frequency of CD4 and VL testing, the percentage of adults with CD4 or VL tests, and among those having a test, the percentage starting ART with advanced HIV disease (CD4 count <200 cells/mm3) or failing to suppress viral replication (>1000 HIV-RNA copies/mL) after ART initiation. We used mixed effect logistic regression to assess time trends adjusted for age and sex. Results: Among 502,456 adults, the percentage with CD4 testing at ART initiation decreased from a high of 78.1% in 2008 to a low of 38.0% in 2017; the probability declined by 14% each year (odds ratio (OR) 0.86; 95% CI 0.86 to 0.86). Frequency of CD4 testing also declined. The percentage starting ART with advanced HIV disease declined from 83.3% in 2005 to 23.5% in 2018; each year the probability declined by 20% (OR 0.80; 95% CI 0.80 to 0.81). VL testing after starting ART varied; 61.0% of adults in South Africa and 10.7% in Malawi were tested, but fewer than 2% were tested in the other four countries. The probability of VL testing after ART start increased only modestly each year (OR 1.06; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.06). The percentage with unsuppressed VL was 8.6%. There was no evidence of a decrease in unsuppressed VL over time (OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.01). Conclusions: CD4 cell counting declined over time, including testing at the start of ART, despite the fact that many patients still initiated ART with advanced HIV disease. Without CD4 testing and expanded VL testing many patients with advanced HIV disease and treatment failure may go undetected, threatening the effectiveness of ART in sub-Saharan Africa.},

While numerous works have provided projections of the progression of the pandemic, very little work has been focused on its progression in Africa and South Africa, in particular. In this work, we calibrate the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) compartmental model to South African data using initial conditions inferred from progression in Hubei, China and Lombardy, Italy. The results suggest two plausible hypotheses - either the COVID-19 pandemic is still at very early stages of progression in South Africa or a combination of prompt mitigating measures, demographics and social factors have resulted in a slowdown in its spread and severity. We further propose pandemic monitoring and health system capacity metrics for assisting decision-makers in evaluating which of the two hypotheses is most probable.},

abstract = {Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China in December 2019. Although, the disease appeared in Africa later than other regions, it has now spread to virtually all countries on the continent. We provide early spatio-temporal dynamics of COVID-19 within the first 62 days of the disease's appearance on the African continent. We used a two-parameter hurdle Poisson model to simultaneously analyze the zero counts and the frequency of occurrence. We investigate the effects of important healthcare capacities including hospital beds and number of medical doctors in the different countries. The results show that cases of the pandemic vary geographically across Africa with notably high incidence in neighboring countries particularly in West and North Africa. The burden of the disease (per 100,000) mostly impacted Djibouti, Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria. Temporally, during the first 4 weeks, the burden was highest in Senegal, Egypt and Mauritania, but by mid-April it shifted to Somalia, Chad, Guinea, Tanzania, Gabon, Sudan, and Zimbabwe. Currently, Namibia, Angola, South Sudan, Burundi and Uganda have the least burden. These findings could be useful in guiding epidemiological interventions and the allocation of scarce resources based on heterogeneity of the disease patterns.},

abstract = {Background: Evidence has shown that the prescribed lockdown and physical distancing due to the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have made accessing essential health care services much more difficult in low-and middle-income countries. Access to contraception is an essential service and should not be denied, even in a global crisis, because of its associated health benefits. Therefore, it is important to maintain timely access to contraception without unnecessary barriers. Hence, this study examines the factors contributing to limited access to condoms and sources of condoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa. Methods: This study used the National Income Dynamics Study-Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey (NIDS-CRAM) wave 1 survey dataset. The NIDS-CRAM is a nationally representative survey of the National Income Dynamics Survey (NIDS) conducted via telephone interview during COVID-19 in the year 2020. This is the first secondary dataset on COVID-19 conducted by NIDS during pandemic. A total of 5304 respondents were included in the study. Data were analysed using frequencies distribution percentages, chi-square test and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results: Almost one-quarter (22.40%) of South Africans could not access condoms, and every 7 in 10 South Africans preferred public source of condoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Those who were from other population groups [AOR = 0.37; 95% CI = 0.19–0.74] and those who were in the third wealth quintile [AOR = 0.60; 95% CI = 0.38–0.93] had lower odds of having access to condoms while those respondents who were aged 25–34 [AOR = 0.48; 95% CI = 0.27–0.83] and those with a secondary level of education and above [AOR = 0.24; 95% CI = 0.08–0.71] were less likely to prefer public source of condom. Conclusions: This study concludes that there was limited access to condoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and that the preferred source of condoms was very skewed to public sources in South Africa. Strategic interventions such as community distribution of free condoms to avert obstruction of condom access during the COVID-19 pandemic or any future pandemics should be adopted.},

Our study sought to evaluate the incidence and predictors of cART-induced hepatotoxicity (CIH) among long term users on cART in a rural District hospital. Methods This was a hospital-based cross-sectional study in the Bali District Hospital. Spectrophotometric method was use for the quantitative measurement of alanine-aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate-aminotransferase (AST) levels. Patients with elevations of both ALT and AST were considered CIH. The Chi ($\chi$2) square test, ANOVA and Kaplan Meier log-ranked/ survival analyses were used to analyse the data. Results Of the 350 participants enrolled [156 (44.6%) males and 194 (55.4%) females], aged 43.87 ± 0.79 years (range 20 – 84 years) included in this analysis, 26 (4.4%) experienced moderate CIH. We observed 57 (16.3%), 62 (17.7%) and 238 (68%) elevated levels ALT + AST, ALT and AST respectively. Two independent predictive factors of CIH were, the male sex and alcoholism during the study period. Conclusion The prevalence of CIH in HIV-infected patients in Bali was lower than that observed in previous studies. The duration of therapy had no influence on the frequency of CIH. Alcoholism and smoking showed significant differences in the development of CIH. * Abbreviations 3TC Lamivudine, 95% C.I 95% Confidence Interval AIDS Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ALT Alanine Amino Transferase ARV Antiretroviral Therapy AST Aspartate Amino Transferase AZT Zidovudine cART Combined Antiretroviral Therapy CIH cART-Induced Hepatotoxicity CD4+ Cluster of Differentiation-4+ cells EFV Efavirenz HR Hazard Ratio HA Health Area HAART Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy HIV Human Immunodeficiency Virus N(NRTI) Non (Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor) OR Odds Ratio p Significance value VL Viral Load WHO World Health Organisation $\chi$2 Chi square.},

abstract = {Background: Across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), HIV disproportionately affects men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) compared with other men of the same age group in the general population. Access to HIV services remains low among this group although several effective interventions have been documented. It is therefore important to identify what has worked well to increase the reach of HIV services among MSM. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, POPLINE and the Web of Science databases to collect published articles reporting HIV interventions among MSM across sub-Saharan Africa. Covidence was used to review the articles. The review protocol was registered in International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) - CRD42017060808. Results: The search identified 2627 citations, and following removal of duplicates and inclusion and exclusion criteria, only 15 papers were eligible for inclusion in the review. The articles reported various accrual strategies, namely: respondent driven sampling, known peers identified through hotspot or baseline surveys, engagement with existing community-based organizations, and through peer educators contacting MSM in virtual sites. Some programs, however, combined some of these accrual strategies. Peer-led outreach services were indicated to reach and deliver services to more MSM. A combination of peer outreach and mobile clinics increased uptake of health information and services. Health facilities, especially MSM-friendly facilities attract access and use of services by MSM and retention into care. Conclusions: There are various strategies for accrual and delivering services to MSM across SSA. However, each of these strategies have specific strengths and weaknesses necessitating combinations of interventions and integration of the specific context to inform implementation. If the best of intervention content and implementation are used to inform these services, sufficient coverage and impact of HIV prevention and treatment programs for MSM across SSA can be optimized.},

For projections over EA, five best performing CMIP6 models (based on their performance ranking in historical mean temperature simulations) under the shared socioeconomic pathways SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios were employed. The historical simulations reveal an overestimation of the mean annual T2m cycle over the study region with fewer models depicting underestimations. Further, CMIP6 models reproduce the spatial and temporal trends within the observed range proximity. Overall, the best performing models are as follows: FGOALS-g3, HadGEM-GC31-LL, MPI-ESM2-LR, CNRM-CM6-1,andIPSL-CM6A-LR. During the three-time slices under consideration, the Multi Model Ensemble (MME) project many changes during the late period (2080–2100) with expected mean changes at 2.4 °C for SSP2-4.5 and 4.4 °C for the SSP5-8.5 scenario. The magnitude of change based on Sen's slope estimator and Mann-Kendall test reveal significant increasing tendencies with projections of 0.24 °C decade-1 (0.65 °C decade-1) under SSP2-4.5(SSP5-8.5) scenarios. The findings from this study illustrate higher warming in the latest model outputs of CMIP6 relative to its predecessor, despite identical instantaneous radiative forcing.},

The paucity of reports in Africa is in contrast with the demographics of the series in New York, Paris and UK with children of African ancestry accounting for over 40% of all cases of MIS-C. With the global trend of higher prevalence of MIS-C in children of African ancestry, enhanced surveillance and awareness for this syndrome in children with COVID-19 in Africa are therefore important. A case report of a 12-year-old Nigerian girl with MIS-C is presented in line with the WHO global surveillance especially in areas were MIS-C is considered a rarity. This case report stimulates a call for vigilance and expanded effort at surveillance to promote early recognition and diagnosis of MIS-C in Nigeria and Africa. The favourable outcome and experience from this case will create awareness, expand knowledge, and support clinicians in Nigeria and the African continent in their approach to other potential cases.},

abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) is a key component of forest productivity and soil organic carbon stock. However, little is known about SOM and C variability in miombo woodlands which is a significant ecosystem in sub-Sahara African forests and vital for REDD+ strategies. In this study, nine edaphic factors were measured and used to analyse the variability of SOM in miombo woodland sites with different tree structures in Luanshya, Zambia. The findings showed a large variability of SOM stocks at different soil depths: 36.67 to 113.89 Mg ha-1 at 0–10 cm depth, 28.67 to 79.56 Mg ha-1 at 10–20 cm depth, and 31.89 to 98.56 Mg ha-1 at 20–30 cm depth. These SOM values at different depths also varied between miombo woodland sites of different successional stages, notably that areas affected by recent tree clearance had higher than average SOM content per layer (0–10 cm: +5.57%; 10–20 cm: +4.20%; 20–30 cm: +4.30%). Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed that the most significant environmental factors influencing SOM were woodland thinning by clearance, and silt content within soils. This study highlights that CCA can be used to show the relative importance of different forest successional stages as a function of management practices, as well as edaphic factors, in determining miombo soil SOM content. The results of this study are particularly relevant for addressing current REDD+ reforestation and management strategies that are aimed at increasing carbon stocks in the tropical forests of sub-Saharan Africa.},

abstract = {The choice of solar collector type to employ and the number of chosen collectors to subsequently deploy, are important planning decisions, which can greatly influence the economic attractiveness of solar water heating systems. In this paper, a thermo-economic model is developed for the computation of a suitable metric that can aid in choosing the most cost-effective collector to use in a solar water heating system and to determine the optimal sizing of the solar water heater components once the choice collector has been picked. The energy-per-dollar comparison metric, calculated as the annual heat energy output of the collector in an average year, at the so-called “sweet-spot” size of the collector array, divided by the annualized life-cycle cost, based on warranty life and collector initial cost, was recommended as instructive for comparing cost-effectiveness of different solar collectors. For the determination of the sweet-spot size of collector to use in a particular solar water heating system, at which the energy-per-dollar is calculated, the Net Present Value of Solar Savings was used as the objective function to maximize. Ten (10) different models of liquid solar thermal collectors (5 flat plate and 5 evacuated tube type), which are rated by the Solar Ratings & Certification Corporation (SRCC), were ranked according to the energy-per-dollar criterion through the thermo-economic model described in this study. At the sweet-spot collector area for the solar water heating system, the corresponding volume of hot water storage tank and the optimal solar fraction are also simultaneously determined. The required hot water storage volume decreases as the deployed collector area increases while the solar fraction increases, with diminishing marginal increase, until it saturates at a value of unity. For the present case study where the required load temperature is 50 °C and the solar water heating system is located in central Zimbabwe (latitude 19° S and longitude 30° E), the selected collector model happened to be a flat-plate type, which achieved the highest energy-per-dollar score of 26.1 kWh/$. The optimal size of this collector model to deploy in the solar water heating system at the case-study location is 18 m2 per m3 of daily hot water demand; with a hot water storage volume of 900 l/m3; at an optimal solar fraction of 91%. Although the method of this paper was applied only for a solar water heating application of specified operating temperature, at a specified location, it can be applied equally well for any other solar water heating application and at any other location.},

abstract = {Cyanobacteria are single-celled algae that thrive in warm and nutrient rich water bodies. They can produce different kinds of toxins called cyanotoxins that can affect the liver. Cyanobacteria have been reported in Lake Victoria, which is an important source of drinking water for the riparian communities. This is as a result of eutrophication in Lake Victoria increasing the levels of cyanobacteria in the Nyanza Gulf. The purpose of this study was to identify and quantify microcystins in household and Lake Victoria water in Nyanza Gulf. In a longitudinal study adopting experimental design, six beaches were studied and 127 samples collected monthly from both households and beaches over six months. Cyanobacterial levels were determined using an enzyme assay method (PP2A) and microcystin strains identified using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Two-way ANOVA was done to determine statistical significance of microcystins. The results showed that all beaches were eutrophic resulting in flourishing of cyanobacteria. 84% of water samples contained microcystins. Concentration of microcystins was 3.44g/L. Microcystin RR (MC-RR) is the most abundant cyanotoxins followed by Microcystin YR (MC-YR) and Microcystin LR (MC-LR) is the least abundant in the Nyanza Gulf. There was significant variation between different beaches and different months (ANOVA: F=12.09, p<0.0005). This information provides an insight into the quality of Lake Victoria water for drinking based on quantities of microcystins in the sampled water. The study recommends regular monitoring of cyanobacterial cells in the lake water.},

abstract = {Introduction The novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), in Africa is characterised by a more substantial proportion of asymptomatic (or mildly symptomatic) individuals thought to be playing a role in the spread of the infection. The exact proportion and degree of infectiousness of asymptomatic individuals remains unclear. Studies however indicate that their management is crucial for control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Methodology We developed a simplified deterministic susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) mathematical model to assess the effect of active isolation of SARS-CoV-2 infected but asymptomatic individuals through blanket testing for control of the outbreak in Lusaka Province of Zambia. Here we modelled two scenarios; (1) assuming asymptomatic individuals comprised 70% of all COVID-19 cases and (2) asymptomatic individuals comprised only 50% of the cases. For contrast, the model was assessed first under the assumption that asymptomatic individuals are equally as infectious as symptomatic individuals and then secondly, and more likely, assuming asymptomatic individuals are only half as infectious as symptomatic individuals. Results For the model assuming 70% asymptomatic cases, a minimum sustained daily blanket testing rate of ≥ 7911 tests/100000 population was sufficient to control the outbreak if asymptomatic individuals are only half as infectious while if equal infectiousness was assumed then a testing rate of ≥ 10028 tests/ 100000 population would be required. For 50% asymptomatic, minimum blanket testing rates of ≥ 4540 tests/ 100000 population was sufficient to control the outbreak at both assumed levels of infectiousness for asymptomatic individuals relative to symptomatic individuals. Discussion and conclusion Our model predicts that active isolation of COVID-19 cases, including asymptomatic individuals, through blanket testing can be used as a possible measure for the control of the SARS-Cov-2 transmission in Lusaka, Zambia, but it would come at a high cost.},

abstract = {The outbreak of coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) has rabidly spread all over the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) has announced that coronavirus COVID-19 is an international pandemic. The Real-Time Reverse transcription-polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) has a low positive and sensitivity rate in the early stage of COVID-19. As a result, the Computed Tomography (CT) imaging is used for diagnosing. COVID-19 has different key signs on a CT scan differ from other viral pneumonia. These signs include ground-glass opacities, consolidations, and crazy paving. In this paper, an Artificial Intelli-gence-inspired Model for COVID-19 Diagnosis and Prediction for Patient Response to Treatment (AIMDP) is proposed. AIMDP model has two main functions reflected in two proposed modules, namely, the Diagnosis Module (DM) and Prediction Module (PM). The Diagnosis Module (DM) is proposed for early and accurately detecting the patients with COVID-19 and distinguish it from other viral pneumonias using COVID-19 signs obtained from CT scans. The DM model, uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) as a Deep learning technique for segmentation, can process hundreds of CT images in seconds to speed up diagnosis of COVID-19 and contribute in its containment. In addition, some countries haven't the ability to provide all patients with the treatment and intensive care services, so it will be mandatory to give treatment to only responding patients. In this context, the Prediction Module (PM) is proposed for predicting the ability of the patient to respond to treatment based on different factors e.g. age, infection stage, respiratory failure, multi-organ failure and the treatment regimens. PM implement the Whale Optimization Algorithm for selecting the most relevant patient's features. The experimental results show promising performance for the proposed diagnosing and prediction modules, using a dataset with hundreds of real data and CT images.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThere is no Funding appliedAuthor DeclarationsAll relevant ethical guidelines have been followed; any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained and details of the IRB/oversight body are included in the manuscript.YesAll necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

abstract = { Background : Digital tools that support open science practices play a key role in the seamless accumulation, archiving and dissemination of scholarly data, outcomes and conclusions. Despite their integration into open science practices, the providence and design of these digital tools are rarely explicitly scrutinized. This means that influential factors, such as the funding models of the parent organizations, their geographic location, and the dependency on digital infrastructures are rarely considered. Suggestions from literature and anecdotal evidence already draw attention to the impact of these factors, and raise the question of whether the open science ecosystem can realise the aspiration to become a truly “unlimited digital commons” in its current structure.  Methods : In an online research approach, we compiled and analysed the geolocation, terms and conditions as well as funding models of 242 digital tools increasingly being used by researchers in various disciplines.  Results : Our findings indicate that design decisions and restrictions are biased towards researchers in North American and European scholarly communities. In order to make the future open science ecosystem inclusive and operable for researchers in all world regions including Africa, Latin America, Asia and Oceania, those should be actively included in design decision processes.  Conclusions : Digital open science tools carry the promise of enabling collaboration across disciplines, world regions and language groups through responsive design. We therefore encourage long term funding mechanisms and ethnically as well as culturally inclusive approaches serving local prerequisites and conditions to tool design and construction allowing a globally connected digital research infrastructure to evolve in a regionally balanced manner. },

Journal publications were used to measure research output. From the analysis, 86% of the publications fell within one or more of the national development priority areas, though 60% were in only 6 of the 35 areas. Several areas had no publications at all during the period under investigation. Furthermore, excluding the health and education sectors, a strong positive relationship was established between the number of publications in different priority areas and those areas' contribution to Gross Domestic Product.

abstract = {Anecdotal evidence suggests social media are used by individuals and groups wanting to incite hatred and violence, yet the empirical evidence we present in this report suggests the these extreme forms of speech are actually marginal. Building on a collaboration between the University of Oxford and Addis Ababa University we examined thousands of comments made by Ethiopians on Facebook during four months around the time of the country's general election. Hate speech – defined as statements to incite others to discriminate or act against individuals or groups on grounds of their ethnicity, nationality, religion or gender – was found in just 0.7% of overall statements in the representative sample. These findings may have wide implications for the many countries trying to address growing concerns about the role played by social media in promoting radicalisation or violence. Ethiopia represented an exceptional case study because of its distinct languages, which allowed gaining a realistic sample of the overall online debates focused on one country. We analysed Facebook statements made by Ethiopians, both in their homeland and abroad, in the run-up to and just after the general election on 24 May 2015. We found that fans or followers rather than people with any real influence online are mainly responsible for the violent or aggressive speech that appeared on Facebook pages in the sample. These individuals appear to use Facebook to vent their anger against more powerful sections of society. Around 18% of total comments in the sample were written by fans or followers compared with 11% of comments made by highly influential speakers (the owners of web pages). One fifth (21.8%) of hostile comments were grounded in political differences, only slightly higher than the overall average of 21.4% of all conversations containing hostile comments. Religion and ethnicity provoked fewer hostile comments (10% and 14% of overall comments in sample respectively). The findings are based on the analysis of more than 13,000 statements posted on 1,055 Facebook pages between February and June 2015. They mapped Facebook profiles, pages, and groups that had 100 or more followers or likes or members, respectively. All content in the sample studied had to include an Ethiopian language and raise discussion topics about Ethiopia. We focused on popular spaces on Facebook, analysing such pages daily to map ongoing trends, but also included comments on some online random pages or pages capturing particular events, such as a protest or publicised speeches.

@article{Workneh2021,
abstract = {In 2018, Ethiopia experienced a tectonic political shift following the culmination of years of public outcry against the now defunct ruling party, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). Protest groups, predominantly organized along ethnic identification, have used social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter to disseminate strategies, recruit members, and galvanize support. Anchored on theories of collective identity and moral outrage, this study investigates the role of social media platforms in mobilizing Ethiopians toward political reform during the protest and post-protest periods demarcated by the ascent of Abiy Ahmed as the new Prime Minister of Ethiopia. Data generated from a mixed method approach consisting of an online survey and interviews indicate social media platforms played a crucial role by drawing Ethiopian youth to participate in political discourse, empowering formerly marginalized groups to influence policy, and fostering ingroup cultural/political cohesion. However, evidence indicates participation opportunities created by social media platforms also brought apprehension including the rise of outrage communication as manifested by inflammatory expressions, hate speech, and political extremism. By proposing outrage communication as a viable construct that captures this phenomenon, I argue, in the context of a polity embodying highly heterogeneous and competing collective identities–ethnic or otherwise–such as Ethiopia, social media platforms are likely to increase ingroup political participation but chronically diminish outgroup engagement.},

@article{Beyene2015,
abstract = {An ambitious experiment in the ICT and justice sector is underway in Ethiopia. As part of an effort to improve service delivery and the responsiveness of the state, the Ethiopian government has created ‘TeleCourt,' a system that allows trials to take place between remote areas and regional or federal courts through videoconferencing and a satellite Internet connection. This article is the first to analyze how TeleCourt operates, with a particular focus on the perspectives of end-users, those who have had first-hand experience of how ‘justice at a distance' actually works. The findings suggest general satisfaction with the savings – both in terms of financial burden and time costs that are often incurred when travelling to trials – which TeleCourt allows. As the system improves ways to provide justice to the grassroots, in line with the government's commitment towards peasants, this must also be considered in the context of the Ethiopian government's growing efforts to use law to curb political dissent. This is indicative of a broader tendency of selectively adopting and reshaping ICTs and extending them to the poorest people in Ethiopia in order to support the functioning of the state, while other uses of ICTs that are seen as potentially destabilizing are discouraged or forbidden.},

@article{Bach2011,
abstract = {Since 1991 and the arrival of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) into power, the Ethiopian ideologists have maintained revolutionary democracy (abyotawi democracy in Amharic) as their core doctrine. The notion inherited from the struggle (1970s-1980s) aims at legitimizing a political and economic structure which de facto implies the resilience of authoritarianism. Abyotawi democracy has been presented by EPRDF as the exact opposite of liberalism and neoliberalism. As no article dedicated to a review and engagement with EPRDF's abyotawi democracy has been written so far, this article aims at analysing this Ethiopian version of revolutionary democracy. The evolution and uses of the notion since 1991 reveal a "bricolage" that abyotawi democracy has been operating out of Leninism, Marxism, Maoism, and also liberalism. While a review of party pamphlets and official party/state discourses reveals the degree to which revolutionary democracy has become an ambiguous doctrine vis-{\`{a}}-vis "liberalism", the doctrine remains powerful as a fighting tool to exclude internal and external "enemies". {\textcopyright} 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

@article{Abbink2011,
abstract = {One of the core principles instituted by the post-1991 government in Ethiopia that took power after a successful armed struggle was ethnic-based federalism, informed by a neo-Leninist political model called revolutionary democracy. In this model, devised by the reigning Tigray People's Liberation Front (later EPRDF), ethnic identity was to be the basis of politics. Identities of previously non-dominant groups were constitutionally recognized and the idea of pan-Ethiopian identity de-emphasized. This article examines the general features and effects of this new political model, often dubbed an "experiment", with regard to ideas of federal democracy, socio-economic inclusiveness, and ethno-cultural and political rights. After 20 years of TPLF/EPRDF rule, the dominant rhetorical figure in Ethiopian politics is that of ethnicity, which has permeated daily life and overtaken democratic decision-making and shared issue-politics. The federal state, despite according nominal decentralized power to regional and local authorities, is stronger than any previous Ethiopian state and has developed structures of central control and top-down rule that preclude local initiative and autonomy. Ethnic and cultural rights were indeed accorded, and a new economic dynamics is visible. Political liberties, respect for human rights and economic equality are however neglected, and ethnic divisions are on the increase, although repressed. Ethiopia's recent political record thus shows mixed results, with positive elements but also an increasingly authoritarian governance model recalling the features of the country's traditional hierarchical and autocratic political culture. This may produce more debate on the need for "adjusting the experiment". {\textcopyright} 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {This study examines the role that social media played in the organisation of the Occupy Nigeria protest and in holding mainstream media accountable during the protest. Using a mixed-methods research design, we interviewed 19 students from two liberal Nigerian universities who participated in the protest. We also analysed 13,031 contents from protesters' Facebook posts and tweets of the Occupy Nigeria protests. Our data reveal that social media platforms were used most by the protesters to plan and organise for the 2012 Occupy Nigeria protest. Our findings also show that the local mainstream media acquiesced to the pressure from government officials by refusing to cover the protest at its inception until they were forced to do so by the protesters. This perceived inaction by the local mainstream media was cited by some of our interview participants as a source of motivation to participate in the protest. Using social capital theory, this paper argues that social media—the fifth estate—brought about interaction, socialisation, collective engagement, and liberation that was not present in the mainstream media.},

@article{Jacob2015,
abstract = {In the summer of 2013, the Nigerian military, as part of its counterinsurgency operations against Boko Haram insurgents, shut down GSM mobile telephony in three northeast states – Adamawa, Borno and Yobe. This article explores the rationale, impact and citizens' opinion of the mobile phone blackout. It draws on focus group discussions with local opinion leaders and in-depth personal interviews with military and security insiders, as well as data of Boko Haram incidences before, during and after the blackout from military sources and conflict databases. It argues that, although the mobile phone shutdown was ‘successful' from a military-tactical point of view, it angered citizens and engendered negative opinions toward the state and new emergency policies. While citizens developed various coping and circumventing strategies, Boko Haram evolved from an open network model of insurgency to a closed centralized system, shifting the center of its operations to the Sambisa Forest. This fundamentally changed the dynamics of the conflict. The shutdown demonstrated, among others, that while ICTs serve various desirable purposes for developing states, they will be jettisoned when their use challenges the state's legitimacy and raison d'{\^{e}}tre, but not without consequences.},

Computer scientists, physicists, economists, mathematicians, political scientists, bio-informaticists, sociologists, and other scholars are clamoring for access to the massive quantities of information produced by and about people, things, and their interactions. Diverse groups argue about the potential benefits and costs of analyzing genetic sequences, social media interactions, health records, phone logs, government records, and other digital traces left by people. Significant questions emerge. Will large-scale search data help us create better tools, services, and public goods? Or will it usher in a new wave of privacy incursions and invasive marketing? Will data analytics help us understand online communities and political movements? Or will it be used to track protesters and suppress speech? Will it transform how we study human communication and culture, or narrow the palette of research options and alter what 'research' means? Given the rise of Big Data as a socio-technical phenomenon, we argue that it is necessary to critically interrogate its assumptions and biases.

Things of all shapes and sizes-from the smart comb to the smart city and everything between-are now being digitally upgraded with the latest sensors, software, and connectivity. Even your toothbrush can now collect data about when, how long, and how well you brush. And, since it is Bluetooth enabled, it sends that brushing data to cloud servers so that your dentist can monitor your performance and send you personalized tips for a brighter smile. The promise of smart tech is that-by channeling the power of data, networks, and algorithms-we will enjoy a vast array of new capabilities and conveniences. Indeed, it is common for the most energetic boosters to describe smart upgrades in mystical terms. Using smartphones to control our home appliances, they simultaneously exclaim and lament, is the closest we can get to being wand-wielding wizards. While the wonders of smart tech might feel like magical enchantments that enable us to cast digital spells, this book intends to dispel any notions that we inhabit the charmed castle of Fantasia. If anything, it's more like the witchy world of Sabrina, where every spell comes at a cost and unintended consequences abound. Whether celebrating or criticizing smart tech, our attention tends to be captured by concerns about how we choose to use personal devices. The focus on things like how people should detox from the Internet and practice good cyber hygiene elides a far more important issue: how others use digital systems on us, whether we want them to or not.

Enthusiasm for digital opposition peaked with the Arab Spring and troughed through the repressive government apparatus. Social media (SMS, Facebook, Twitter) and crowdsourcing technologies can threaten the government's control over the public sphere as participatory practices. To arrive at this finding, we argue the significance of epistemological tools of those who control the representation of digital power, and approach state legitimacy as an ongoing and fragile process of constructing “reality” that requires continuous work to stabilise and uphold. At the same time, the paper describes an international counterpublic of security researchers and hackers who revealed that the Sudanese government invested greatly in controlling the digital landscape. We analyse Nafeer, a local grass-roots initiative for flood-disaster-relief that made use of digital media despite the digital suppression. Nafeer's challenge to the state came from the way it threatened the state-monopoly over knowledge, revealing both the fragility and the power of state legitimacy.},

abstract = {Online political participation has been presented as a possible solution to declining levels of trust in traditional politics. However, the most marginalised communities are often the least connected and participate least in digital citizenship programmes. Much existing literature rests on a binary understanding of citizens as being either connected or unconnected. Progress is therefore often understood simply as a process of “connecting the unconnected.” This paper presents primary empirical research from the Philippines, which suggests that such binary understandings disguise more than they reveal. We argue that it is descriptively more accurate and more analytically useful to recognise that multiple classes of technology access exist, which limit digital citizenship in multiple ways. Qualitative methods were used to learn from non-users and the least connected about the barriers to online civic participation that they experience. The 5'A's of Technology Access was employed as a framework to analyse those barriers and reveal the social and economic factors that they reflect, reproduce, and amplify. Findings suggest that nonbinary and nontechnical understandings of the barriers to digital inclusion are essential to any effective attempt to remove the remaining obstacles to genuinely inclusive digital citizenship.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: How do public regulations shape the composition and behavior of non-governmental organizations (NGOs)? Because many NGOs advocate liberal causes, such as human rights, democracy, and gender equality, they upset the political status quo. At the same time, a large number of NGOs operating in the Global South rely on international funding. This sometimes disconnects from local publics and leads to the proliferation of sham or ‘briefcase' NGOs. Seeking to rein in the politically inconvenient NGO sector, governments exploit the role of international funding and make the case for restricting the influence of NGOs that serve as foreign agents. To pursue this objective, states worldwide are enacting laws to restrict NGOs' access to foreign funding. We examine this regulatory offensive through an Ethiopian case study, where recent legislation prohibits foreign-funded NGOs from working on politically sensitive issues. We find that most briefcase NGOs and local human rights groups in Ethiopia have disappeared, while survivors have either ‘rebranded' or switched their work from proscribed areas. This research note highlights how governments can and do shape the population ecology of the non-governmental sector. Because NGOs seek legitimacy via their claims of grassroots support, a reliance on external funding makes them politically vulnerable. Any study of the NGO sector must include governments as the key component of NGOs' institutional environment.},

abstract = {This report introduces findings from ten digital rights landscape country reports on Zimbabwe, Zambia, Uganda, Sudan, South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Ethiopia, Egypt, and Cameroon. They analyse how the openings and closings of online civic space affect citizens' digital rights. They show that: (1) when civic space closes offline citizens often respond by opening civic space online; (2) when civic space opens online governments often take measures to close online space; and (3) the resulting reduction in digital rights makes it impossible to achieve the kind of inclusive governance defined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We know far more about openings and closings of online civic space in the global North than we do in the global South. What little we do know about Africa is mainly about a single country, a single event, or single technology. For the first time, these reports make possible a comparative analysis of openings and closings of online civic space in Africa. They document 65 examples of the use of digital technologies to open online civic space and 115 examples of techniques used to close online civic space. The five tactics used most often to close online civic space in Africa are digital surveillance, disinformation, internet shutdowns, legislation, and arrests for online speech. The reports show clearly that any comprehensive analysis of digital rights requires consideration of the wider political, civic space, and technological contexts. We argue that countering the threats to democracy and digital rights discussed in the reports requires new evidence, awareness, and capacity. We propose applied research to build capacity in each country to effectively monitor, analyse, and counter the insidious impact of surveillance and disinformation; and a programme to raise awareness and mobilise opinion to open civic space and improve citizens' ability to exercise, defend, and expand their digital rights.},

Attitudes towards traditional medicine vary strongly with the tradition and cultures of the people and this has raised a serious confusion between herbal medicine and witchcraft. Millions of Africans and South Sudanese in particular prefer treatment and use of medicinal plant products made from indigenous plants, because it represents an important source of affordable medicine as well as sources of income for rural communities. 25% of the world medicinal plants are found in the African continent, but only 8% are used because information is transferred verbally from generation to generation and much is not unknown. The set back is due to lack of proof that medicinal plants are useful, safe and effective and can be used as alternative medicine. Many plants species are likely to become extinct as well as endangered as population increases demand also increases, giving greater pressure on medicinal plants. As a result, 50% of medicinal plants worldwide are threatened with extinction due to rampant exploration. Traditional herbal medicines are identified and produced by traditional medicinal practitioners in Africa. Many herbs grown in South Sudan and in African continent have valuable medical properties but traditional methods used have many disadvantages that can be corrected and developed to make them effective, stable and reproductive through the methods of scientific research.},

abstract = {Project managers from both the public and private sectors have always known that better project management is often synonymous with better risk management. As such, all projects are subject to risk factors that make their management more or less complicated. In this article, we contend that successful project managers need tools to better identify and assess project risks and we try to provide such a tool in the form of grid of specific risk factors. This article analyzes risk factors in IT projects conducted using public–private partnership (PPP) procurement from the public partner's perspective. Our research uses, as empirical case studies, three projects undertaken by the Tunisian government in partnership with IT and engineering companies. The results reveal 13 specific risk factors, which are classified into three generic risk factor categories: strategic, operational, and key resources. The adverse effects of risks materializing are also identified and analyzed.},

abstract = {Growing urbanization trends, together with a greater environmental awareness, are transforming cities into game changers in the sustainability game. Cities are under pressure in both developed as well as developing economies. In developed countries, the challenge is to be able to tackle a lack of infrastructure, such as clean water and sanitation and mass transit transport systems. In developed countries, the challenges are distinct, but not less. There are growing needs for a renewal of infrastructures, such as water, transportation and energy systems, which deteriorate over time, and the related increasing challenges regarding the sustainability of the systems. Drivers of change include lower costs, greater levels of efficiency, better response to natural disasters (resilience), an ability to provide a good service, among others. Cities, regulators and operators are focused on improving innovation and develop truly smart cities and smart infrastructure. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) have been at the forefront of infrastructure development and management, however, questions exist regarding existing models which are usable for smart infrastructure. Our thesis is that existing models of PPP need to be significantly restructured, to be able to provide an adequate response to the smart infrastructure challenges and to be a driving force to make cities smarter. Greater flexibility is necessary, as is a profound change of the existing regulatory and procurement models, in order to ensure that the private sector will continue to have a pivotal role with regards to infrastructure, financing and management.},

The study adopted the descriptive survey design and used teaching staff (lecturers) as the population of the study. Design/methodology/approach: A sample size of 278 was used for the study. The study used questionnaires to obtain data from participants. The study revealed that faculty members appreciate digital scholarship through the services offered by Sam Jonah Library are relevant to the current higher education context, reliable information, preservation of information resources and facilitating the integration of library services into the learning process are closely integrated into the library service, transform scholarly communication, teaching and learning style and research paradigm. Findings: The study revealed that digital scholarship contributes to faculty members' delivery at the University of Cape Coast through the provision of information literacy training for new students, provision of reference lists of materials available in the library and provision of lists of new materials. The study revealed that faculty members face inadequate facilities to enhance digital scholarship, inadequate open access to reading materials (articles, books, etc.), inadequate platforms or suite of tools for librarians to take faculty. Practical implications: The application of digital scholarship provides an expansion to the core competitiveness of librarians new services which enables innovativeness and transformation of libraries. Students will be equipped with digital literacy skills; it affords instructors to approach teaching with innovation and scholars are also engaged to perform novel practices in scholarship acquisition. Digital scholarship is the umbrella under which all academic technologies comes under to foster collaboration and better learning experience. Originality/value: This paper offers an insight of the role digital scholarship in promoting and advancing scholarship in the academic environment. It highlights a number of digital scholarship platform available in the library. It is observed that digital scholarship practices must be encouraged in the library because it facilitates the role of academic library which is to support teaching, learning and research.},

Moreover, our research identifies six key factors that define the literature, which are information literacy, developing digital literacy, digital learning, ICT, social media, and twenty-first century digital skills. These factors can be grouped into three main streams, which are 1) digital literacy, 2) digital learning and 3) twenty-first century digital skills. These three streams are supported by informational and technological foundations. These results provide research avenues and offer a framework for digital literacy in education.},

Despite the significant attention paid to the nature and suitability of such policies targeted at young people, there has been far less focus on digital skills policies targeted at adults. This article contributes to this literature. It outlines current digital skills policy in England. Having established this background, it analyses 30 interviews with digitally competent adults from lower socio-economic backgrounds about their experiences of learning to use the Internet. In doing so, the article highlights that a narrow and instrumental digital skills agenda is emerging in the education of adults, driven by the needs of the commercial sector, that is in stark contrast to the experiences, motivations and hopes of adults who learn about, and use, digital technologies. Reframing digital skills as part of a broader adult education agenda may offer a way to facilitate the development of digital literacies that individuals seek.},

abstract = {Digital inclusion can bridge the digital divide and reduce the social exclusion of older adults, yet it is understudied in China. This research examined factors influencing the digital inclusion of older adults in China and the relationship between digital inclusion and quality of life. Data collected from 312 older people (M = 69.6 years old) in Nanjing were included in a multinomial logit model to tackle these questions. Their attitudes toward technology were the most significant factor predicting their digital inclusion. Other factors included party affiliation, living situation, personal average monthly income, occupation, and capacity for instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). This study shows digital inclusion has a direct impact on quality of life. It also serves as an intermediate variable that affects older people's attitudes toward technology and their IADL capacities. Most importantly, digital inclusion promotes social integration of older adults and improves the quality of their lives. Hence, it should not be ignored. Older people's attitudes toward technology are one of the keys to promoting their digital inclusion.},

abstract = {Existing discussions of rural–urban education inequality focus primarily on education investment and/or attainment, with little attention being paid to the opportunities or potential that an area has to achieve better educational outcomes. This study presents a new analytical framework based on Amartya Sen's capability approach for a better understanding of rural–urban education disparity. In addition, the rural–urban definitions for educational research are clarified and the effects of a wide range of Central Government policies aimed at reducing the rural–urban educational gap are assessed. The results suggest: inadequate investment (e.g., funding and high-quality teaching resources) in rural education in some regions, especially middle and high schools; inappropriate partitioning of the national territory by the Government for policy implementation; and negative effects resulting from the school consolidation policy. The latter will influence the ability of some rural areas to match the educational achievements of their urban counterparts. This research also reveals that the existing rural–urban gap will be unlikely to narrow under the current policy regime. A conventional approach based on investment and outcomes alone in rural–urban disparity research and policy may overlook the important interactions and conversion processes that are important for mitigating rural–urban disparities.},

abstract = {Rapid urbanization in China has worsened the educational disparity between rural and urban regions, which can lead to increased social stratification and injustice. Information and communications technologies (ICTs), with their potential to enable universal access and pedagogical reform, are considered a promising solution to bridge such disparity. To gain a deeper understanding of how ICTs can promote equity and quality in China's education system, this study employed the extended case method to critically evaluate the longitudinal changes in four rural schools since the implementation of ICT initiatives in 2014. Our study revealed that ICTs acted as an external force that disrupted the status quo of rural education in terms of pedagogical and curricular norms, classroom structure and dynamics, perceived school and teacher identities, and induced positive changes such as increased academic performance, social and emotional development for left-behind children, and professional development for rural teachers. The study also offered theoretical insight into the socioeconomic factors hindering the sustainable development of ICT-supported rural education. Our research findings can contribute to the theory development in educational equity, educational quality, and social justice, and inform policy formulation to revamp rural education in China.},

abstract = {Purpose: Information and digital literacy have recently received much interest, and they are being viewed as critical strategic organisational resources and skills that employees need to obtain in order to function at their workplaces. Yet, the role of employees' literacy seems to be neglected in current literature. This paper aims to explore the roles that information and digital literacy play on the employees' perception in relation to usefulness and ease of use of digital technologies and consequently their intention to use technology in the practices they perform at the workplace. Design/methodology/approach: This paper builds a conceptual model with key constructs (information literacy and digital literacy) as new antecedents to the technology acceptance model and aims to establish that information literacy and digital literacy are indirect determinants of employees' intention to use digital technologies at the workplace. The data set used in this paper comprises of 121 respondents and structural equation modelling was used. Findings: The findings reveal that both information literacy and digital literacy have a direct impact on perceived ease of use of technology but not on the perceive usefulness. The findings also show that both literacies have an indirect impact on the intention to use digital technology at work via attitude towards use. Practical implications: Managers and decision-makers should pay close attention to the literacy levels of their staff. Because literacies are such an important skillset in the digital age, managers and chief information officers may want to start by identifying which work groups or individuals require literacy training and instruction, and then provide specific and relevant training or literacy interventions to help those who lack sufficient literacy. Originality/value: This is one of the first studies to consider information literacy and digital literacy as new antecedents of the technology acceptance model at the workplace environment.},

Yet as digital texts have proliferated and evolved, there has been much conjecture over what it means to be ‘digitally literate'. As literacy researchers from Australia, Sweden and Argentina we are concerned with the drive to standardise definitions of ‘digital literacy' despite notable differences in the cultural politics of education in each country. This paper analyses how the term digital literacy has been conceptualised and applied by scholars in these three language contexts. To do this, we analyse the most cited publications on digital literacy in the English-speaking; Scandinavian; and Spanish-speaking contexts. In the analysis the variety of definitions across and within each context, the key tensions and challenges that emerge and the implications for digital literacy education are explored. Our findings reveal that similar tensions and challenges exist in all three contexts, however, the path to resolution varies given contextual differences. The article concludes with suggestions for educational research that acknowledges and advocates the need for local conceptualisations of digital literacies in increasingly globalised educational systems.},

abstract = {African populations are vastly underrepresented in genetic studies but have the most genetic variation and face wide-ranging environmental exposures globally. Because systematic evaluations of genetic prediction had not yet been conducted in ancestries that span African diversity, we calculated polygenic risk scores (PRS) in simulations across Africa and in empirical data from South Africa, Uganda, and the UK to better understand the generalizability of genetic studies. PRS accuracy improves with ancestry-matched discovery cohorts more than from ancestry-mismatched studies. Within ancestrally and ethnically diverse South Africans, we find that PRS accuracy is low for all traits but varies across groups. Differences in African ancestries contribute more to variability in PRS accuracy than other large cohort differences considered between individuals in the UK versus Uganda. We computed PRS in African ancestry populations using existing European-only versus ancestrally diverse genetic studies; the increased diversity produced the largest accuracy gains for hemoglobin concentration and white blood cell count, reflecting large-effect ancestry-enriched variants in genes known to influence sickle cell anemia and the allergic response, respectively. Differences in PRS accuracy across African ancestries originating from diverse regions are as large as across out-of-Africa continental ancestries, requiring commensurate nuance. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {The burden of breast and cervical cancer is increasing exponentially, especially among women in low- and mid-income countries. Early detection, hinged on screening uptake is a key to higher survival rate and managing cancer outcome. The present study assessed Nigerians and Egyptians' knowledge of breast self-examination (BSE) and breast and cervical cancer screening. A cross-sectional questionnaire was utilized to obtain 1,006 respondents via a convenient sampling method. The mean age of respondents was 30.43 ± 6.69. About one-third of participants had good knowledge (> 66%) of breast cancer screening (42%), cervical cancer screening (44%) and BSE practice (36%). Age range (26–40 years), educational level (tertiary), and marital status were demographic data that influenced knowledge level. The screening uptake among the studied population is very poor as only (11%) had ever been screened and only (2.2%) ever vaccinated. The major reasons for poor screening uptake were “no awareness of where to be screened” and “no symptoms”. Assessing the knowledge and uptake level of African women through studies like this is crucial in identifying the loopholes in the fight against cancer. More efforts are required for promoting the utilization of cancer screening services, HPV vaccination, and BSE practice among African women. Doi: 10.28991/SciMedJ-2021-0303-3 Full Text: PDF},

abstract = {This chapter discusses the current state of healthcare, challenges and potential local and cross-national solutions related to multiple morbidity in low and middle income countries and vulnerable populations in high income countries, based on interdisciplinary research of provider workload in South Africa and the Caribbean. With a high chronic and noncommunicable disease (NCD) and HIV burden in both settings, it is not uncommon to find patients having this double burden of disease. Additionally, patient resiliency is exacerbated by the multiplication of both demands made by the interactions from treatment modalities and multiple service providers. The Cumulative Complexity Model (CCM) posits that as the burden of disease and resulting workload increase, the patient capacity to respond to it diminishes. In middle and high-income countries, a dedicated system of care for people living with HIV/AIDS was developed in parallel to existing systems of care for NCDs, which has been successful in increasing advocacy, political will, and healthcare worker empowerment. We explore the application of this model across settings, along with other potential solutions.},

abstract = {Objective The risk of cardiovascular events in patients with RA is disproportionately heightened as a result of systemic inflammation. The relative effect of autoimmune-associated citrullination on the structure and thrombotic potential of fibrin(ogen) remains unknown. We therefore compared indices of vascular function, inflammation, coagulation and fibrin clot composition in RA patients with healthy controls and evaluated inter-parameter relationships. Methods Blood samples were collected from 30 RA patients and 25 age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers. Levels of SAA, CRP, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 was measured using a sandwich immunoassay. Whole blood coagulation was assessed using Thromboelastography. Fibrin clot networks and fiber structure was investigated using Scanning Electron Microscopy. The detection and quantification of citrullination in formed fibrin clots were performed using a fluorescently labeled Citrulline monoclonal antibody with Confocal Microscopy. Results Concentrations of SAA, CRP and ICAM-1 were significantly elevated in RA patients compared to controls. TEG parameters relating to coagulation initiation (R and K), rate of fibrin cross-linking ($\alpha$-Angle), and time to reach maximum thrombus generation (TMRTG) were attenuated in RA patients. Parameters relating to clot strength (MA, MRTG, TGG) did not statistically differ between RA and controls. Logistic regression modelling revealed stronger association between acute phase reactants (CRP, SAA) with TEG parameters than endothelial function markers. Microscopic analysis revealed denser networks of thicker fibrin fibers in RA patients compared to controls [median (interquartile range) 214 (170-285) vs 120 (100-144) nm respectively, p<0.0001, Odds ratio=22.7). Detection of multiple citrullinated regions within fibrin clot structures in RA patients, which was less prevalent in control samples (p<0.05, OR=2.2). Conclusion Patients with active RA display a coagulation profile that is dissimilar to general findings associated with other inflammatory conditions. The alteration of protein structures by autoimmune linked citrullination could play a role in determining the structure of fibrin and the potential of conferring a heightened thrombotic risk in RA patients. ### Competing Interest Statement The authors have declared no competing interest.},

abstract = {Studies of insecticide resistance provide insights into the capacity of populations to show rapid evolutionary responses to contemporary selection. Malaria control remains heavily dependent on pyrethroid insecticides, primarily in long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs). Resistance in the major malaria vectors has increased in concert with the expansion of LLIN distributions. Identifying genetic mechanisms underlying high-level resistance is crucial for the development and deployment of resistance-breaking tools. Using the Anopheles gambiae 1000 genomes (Ag1000g) data we identified a very recent selective sweep in mosquitoes from Uganda which localized to a cluster of cytochrome P450 genes. Further interrogation revealed a haplotype involving a trio of mutations, a nonsynonymous point mutation in Cyp6p4 (I236M), an upstream insertion of a partial Zanzibar-like transposable element (TE) and a duplication of the Cyp6aa1 gene. The mutations appear to have originated recently in An. gambiae from the Kenya-Uganda border, with stepwise replacement of the double-mutant (Zanzibar-like TE and Cyp6p4-236 M) with the triple-mutant haplotype (including Cyp6aa1 duplication), which has spread into the Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania. The triple-mutant haplotype is strongly associated with increased expression of genes able to metabolize pyrethroids and is strongly predictive of resistance to pyrethroids most notably deltamethrin. Importantly, there was increased mortality in mosquitoes carrying the triple-mutation when exposed to nets cotreated with the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO). Frequencies of the triple-mutant haplotype remain spatially variable within countries, suggesting an effective marker system to guide deployment decisions for limited supplies of PBO-pyrethroid cotreated LLINs across African countries.},

abstract = {Efforts to preserve, protect and restore ecosystems are hindered by long delays between data collection and analysis. Threats to ecosystems can go undetected for years or decades as a result. Real-time data can help solve this issue but significant technical barriers exist. For example, automated camera traps are widely used for ecosystem monitoring but it is challenging to transmit images for real-time analysis where there is no reliable cellular or WiFi connectivity. We modified an off-the-shelf camera trap (Bushnell™) and customised existing open-source hardware to create a ‘smart' camera trap system. Images captured by the camera trap are instantly labelled by an artificial intelligence model and an ‘alert' containing the image label and other metadata is then delivered to the end-user within minutes over the Iridium satellite network. We present results from testing in the Netherlands, Europe, and from a pilot test in a closed-canopy forest in Gabon, Central Africa. All reference materials required to build the system are provided in open-source repositories. Results show the system can operate for a minimum of 3 months without intervention when capturing a median of 17.23 images per day. The median time-difference between image capture and receiving an alert was 7.35 min, though some outliers showed delays of 5-days or more when the system was incorrectly positioned and unable to connect to the Iridium network. We anticipate significant developments in this field and hope that the solutions presented here, and the lessons learned, can be used to inform future advances. New artificial intelligence models and the addition of other sensors such as microphones will expand the system's potential for other, real-time use cases including real-time biodiversity monitoring, wild resource management and detecting illegal human activities in protected areas.},

To date, however, few studies have examined in detail older adults' access to and use of ICTs. This important aspect of the interaction between population ageing and societal change is more complex than the published literature's portrayal of a dichotomy between 'successful users' and 'unsuccessful non-users'. The paper examines the extent and nature of ICT access and use by older adults in their everyday lives. Information was collected from a sub-sample of 352 adults aged 60 or more years taken from a large household survey of ICT use in England and Wales among 1,001 people. The findings suggest that using a computer is not only a minority activity amongst older adults but also highly stratified by gender, age, marital status and educational background. Conversely, non-use of computers can be attributed to their low relevance and 'relative advantage' to older people. The paper concludes by considering how political and academic assumptions about older people and ICTs might be refocused, away from trying to'change' older adults, and towards involving them in changing ICT.},

Descriptive analyses of a representative sample of 1,578 British Internet users confirm that there continue to be small but significant gender differences for most uses of the Internet.

The fascination of smart cities, able to link high technology, green environment and well-being for citizens, interests all the municipalities, independently on their dimensions, geographical area or culture. However, the concept of smart city is far from to be unambiguous. Several experiences all over the world show that cities define themselves as smart, but the meaning attributed to this word is different each time. Smart city concept has been growing from empirical experience, therefore a systemic theoretical study about this phenomenon still lacks. In this paper, the author aims to propose a comprehensive and verified definition of smart city, based on both a deep literature investigation about smart city studies and a large survey of smart city projects in the international panorama. The goal of this work is not only to provide a clear framework about this interesting and current topic, but also to support local governments and public administrations in effective smart city implementation, able to create public value and well being for citizens and environmental sustainability in the urban space.{\^{A}} },

abstract = {This paper focuses on the need for a widened definition of the notion of technology within the smart city discourse, with a particular focus on the “built environment”. The first part of the paper describes how current tendencies in urban design and architecture are inclined to prioritize high tech-solutions at the expense of low-tech functionalities and omits that information and communication technology (ICT) contrasts the art of building cities as an adaptable and habitually smart technology in itself. It continues with an elaboration on the need for expanding the limits of system boundaries for a better understanding of the energy and material telecouplings that are linked to ICT solutions and account for some perils inherent in smart technologies, such as rebound effects and the difficulty of measuring the environmental impacts of ICT solutions on a city level. The second part of the paper highlights how low-tech technologies and nature-based solutions can make cities smarter, representing a new technology portfolio in national and international policies for safeguarding biodiversity and the delivery of a range of ecosystem services, promoting the necessary climate-change adaption that cities need to prioritize to confer resilience.},

Young adults are the most highly connected age group, but that does not mean that their Internet uses are homogenous. Analyzing data about the Web uses of 270 adults from across the United States, the article explores the differences in 18- to 26-year-olds' online activities and what social factors explain the variation. Findings suggest that those with higher levels of education and of a more resource-rich background use the Web for more "capitalenhancing" activities. Detailed analyses of user attributes also reveal that online skill is an important mediating factor in the types of activities people pursue online. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for a "second-level digital divide," that is, differences among the population of young adult Internet users. {\textcopyright} 2008 Sage Publications.},

This analysis of the triple helix will be augmented using the Analytic Network Process to model, cluster and begin measuring the performance of smart cities. The model obtained allows interactions and feedbacks within and between clusters, providing a process to derive ratio scales priorities from elements.

abstract = {The current literature on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and planning suggests that the use of Information Technology (IT) in local government can enhance the management and functioning of cities. Of particular interest is the phenomenon of e-government, where debates and information surrounding local government matters are conducted in cyberspace. Of relevance also, are the networking opportunities that the Internet can facilitate between city governments and the institutional learning that can emanate from that. The increasing use of web-based Geographic Information Systems (GIS) applications raises awareness of spatial issues that impact on defined municipal areas, whilst interactive mapping provides opportunities for addressing spatial concerns virtually. Most of the literature does, however, focus on the experience of developed countries where capacity and resources permit a sophisticated understanding of ICT. Yet, evidence suggests that these tools are also used in some developing countries, with India often cited as one of the leading countries in achieving ICT prominence, but little seems to be published about this experience in Southern Africa. There are a number of innovative initiatives underway in South African local governments but most of these interventions are in their infancy. In contrast, there are a number of examples in developed countries that may provide some guidance for developing cities. This paper examines the Smart City initiative in Brisbane in Australia, and compares it with moves currently underway in Durban, South Africa to incorporate ICT in local governance. The intention is to expose the differences in approach, understand the capacity and resource issues that may impact, and draw some conclusions with regards to future interventions in Durban. Overall, the paper provides an initial conceptual landscape that begins to determine the extent to which ICT in local government can provide opportunities for Durban by learning from the experience of Brisbane, Australia. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Unceasing growth of population and urbanization have intensified innovative ways to handle urbanization with minimal impact on environment, citizen lifestyles, and governance. Initial integration of information communication technology (ICT) into city operations have promoted telicity, information city, and digital city concepts. Later, the conception of IoT has founded the smart cities, which support the city operations intelligently with minimal human interaction. Smart city emerged as a solution to address the challenges arise with exponential growth of urbanization and population. However, smart city concept is still evolving and not mainstreamed throughout the globe due to technological, economical, and governing barriers. Therefore, this paper aims to deliver the essence of smart cities. The paper presents a brief overview of smart cities, followed by the features and characteristics, generic architecture, composition, and real-world implementations of smart cities.

A plethora of studies have been conducted to identify determinants of digital divides. Unfortunately, there is a lack of consistency in the terminology used. Moreover, terms are often not theoretically grounded. Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature review of digital divide determinants. The results show that the third-level digital divide was underexposed. The primary focus is on Internet use. More importantly, the identified determinants show that digital divide research is largely limited to sociodemographic and socioeconomic determinants.},

This article makes an inventory of 5 years of digital divide research (2000-2005). The article focuses on three questions. (1) To what type of inequality does the digital divide concept refer? (2) What is new about the inequality of access to and use of ICTs as compared to other scarce material and immaterial resources? (3) Do new types of inequality exist or rise in the information society? The results of digital divide research are classified under four successive types of access: motivational, physical, skills and usage. A shift of attention from physical access to skills and usage is observed. In terms of physical access the divide seems to be closing in the most developed countries; concerning digital skills and the use of applications the divide persists or widens. Among the shortcomings of digital divide research are its lack of theory, conceptual definition, interdisciplinary approach, qualitative research and longitudinal research. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The concept of Smart City (SC) as a means to enhance the life quality of citizen has been gaining increasing importance in the agendas of policy makers. However, a shared definition of SC is not available and it is hard to identify common global trends. This paper provides with a comprehensive understanding of the notion of SC through the elaboration of a taxonomy of pertinent application domains, namely: natural resources and energy, transport and mobility, buildings, living, government, and economy and people. It also explores the diffusion of smart initiatives via an empirical study aimed at investigating the ratio of domains covered by a city's best practices to the total of potential domains of smart initiatives and at understanding the role that various economic, urban, demographic, and geographical variables might have in influencing the planning approach to create a smarter city. Results reveal that the evolution patterns of a SC highly depend on its local context factors. In particular, economic development and structural urban variables are likely to influence a city's digital path, the geographical location to affect the SC strategy, and density of population, with its associated congestion problems, might an important component to determine the routes for the SC implementation. This work provides policy makers and city managers with useful guidelines to define and drive their SC strategy and planning actions towards the most appropriate domains of implementation. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

To remedy this shortcoming, in this paper I look at the differences in people's online skills. In order to measure online ability, I assigned search tasks to a random sample of Internet users from a suburban county in the United States. My findings suggest that people search for content in a myriad of ways and there is considerable difference in whether individuals are able to find various types of content on the Web and a large variance in how long it takes to complete online tasks. Age is negatively associated with one's level of Internet skill, experience with the technology is positively related to online skill, and differences in gender do little to explain the variance in the ability of different people to find content online.

abstract = {The smart city has been both celebrated for opening up decision-making processes through responsive digital infrastructures, and criticised for turning citizens into mere nodes of socio-technical networks under corporate or government control. In line with these depictions, smart city politics is often analysed as a struggle between aspirations for bottom-up participatory democracy and authoritarian control. Drawing on ethnographic research on an Amsterdam project which encourages citizens to collect and share air quality data, we problematise this vertical reading of smart city politics. The project mobilises both republican citizenship and cybernetic citizenship, each assuming different logics regarding the ways in which citizens negotiate urban life by means of data and sensing technologies. While republican citizenship emphasises citizens' sovereignty, cybernetic citizenship emphasises their immersion into informational environments. We demonstrate how, depending on specific situated interests and forms of engagement, both kinds of citizenship feed into appealing visions of urban life for different actors.},

The article outlines a more sophisticated, hierarchical model of the digital divide based around these conceptual 'stages' while recognizing the mediating role of economic, cultural and social forms of capital in shaping individuals' engagements with ICT.

Fixing problems and framing stories are presented as the two principal strategies for tackling the various barriers throughout the innovation process. This model is explored in a case study of a technological system for collaboration between police and citizens in The Netherlands. The case shows the value of the model and highlights that e-governance innovation is about designing comprehensive strategies of fixing and framing to tackle the variety of barriers. More specifically, the research highlights that government officials and citizens are not motivated by the promise of technology but by frames that connect technological opportunities to the production of public value.},

The paper focuses on four case studies-namely, India, Indonesia, Uganda, and Nicaragua-to highlight some of the complexities in campaigning for RTI laws and in implementing them. Based on these, a framework is developed as a tool to map alternative approaches to making local governance more effective and accountable. At present, there are two schools of thought: one focusing on supply-led or state-led mechanisms such as public expenditure tracking surveys, and the other focusing on a human rights-based approach with RTI law at its centre. The framework developed here suggests that these alternative approaches need not be considered mutually exclusive approaches but can be seen in terms of Dreze and Sen's argument of democratic institutions and democratic practice. Thus, activists can choose approaches that best suit a context at a given point in time as intermediate steps in the journey towards developing just and inclusive institutions. {\textcopyright} 2011 United Nations Development Programme.},

abstract = {Sensors and systems within rapidly expanding smart cities produce citizen-centered big data which have potential value to support citizen-centered urban governance decision-making. There exists a wealth of extant conceptual studies, however, further operational studies are needed to establish a specific path towards implementation of such data to governance decision-making with analytical algorithms that are appropriate for each step of the path. This paper proposes a framework for the use of citizen-centered big data analysis to drive governance intelligence in smart cities from two perspectives: urban governance issues and data-analysis algorithms. The framework consists of three layers: 1) A data-merging layer, which builds a citizen-centered panoramic data set for each citizen by merging citizen-related big data from multiple sources in collaborative urban governance via similarity calculation and conflict resolution; 2) a knowledge-discovery layer, which plots the citizen profile and citizen persona at both individual and group levels in terms of urban public service delivery and citizen participation via simple statistical analysis techniques, machine learning, and econometrics methods; and 3) a decision-making layer, which uses ontology models to standardize urban governance-related attributes, personas, and associations to support governance decision-making via data mining and Bayesian Net techniques. Finally, the proposed framework is validated in a case study on blood donation governance in China. This research highlights the value of citizen-centered big data, pushes data-to-decision research from conceptual to operational, synthesizes previously published frameworks for citizen-centered big data analysis in smart cities, and enhances the mutual supplement cross multiple disciplinaries.},

@article{Ruohonen2021,
abstract = {This short theoretical and argumentative essay contributes to the ongoing deliberation about the so-called digitalfug sovereignty, as pursued particularly in the European Union (EU). Drawing from classical political science literature, the essay approaches the debate through paradoxes that arise from applying classical notions of sovereignty to the digital domain. With these paradoxes and a focus on the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, the essay develops a viewpoint distinct from the conventional territorial notion of sovereignty. Accordingly, the lesson from Westphalia has more to do with the capacity of a state to govern. It is also this capacity that is argued to enable the sovereignty of individuals within the digital realm. With this viewpoint, the essay further advances another, broader, and more pressing debate on politics and democracy in the digital era.},

abstract = {The Smart City is a fuzzy concept, which integrates numerous characteristics, components and dimensions. These characteristics are challenged in the academic literature, especially the technocentric approach and the central position of private companies. Moreover, the lack of proper conceptualisation pushes cities to claim themselves ‘smart'. Finally, there are few rigorous analytical or statistical analyses of the concept and its application to territories. Therefore, this paper studies how Belgian municipalities understand the concept of Smart Cities in 2016. Based on the groundwork of literature on Smart Cities and the results of a survey of 113 Belgian municipalities, a typology of four understandings of the Smart City (technological, societal, comprehensive and non-existent) is elaborated. The results also show that municipalities with no understanding of the Smart City concept or with a technical understanding are mostly located in small and rural municipalities. This could be a sign of rejection of the phenomenon in this context. Conversely, medium and large-sized municipalities mostly develop a societal or comprehensive understanding. Therefore, this study highlights a dichotomy of understanding and acceptance of the concept of the Smart City between peripheral (rural and small size municipalities) and central municipalities (urban, medium and large size municipalities).},

A key challenge is to diffuse and sustain SIs in ways that transform the relational webs that constitute local spaces and their governance. The relational approach to SI is conceptually promising in this respect, but its foundations and practices need to be further developed. Therefore, I develop a relational ‘theory–methods package' of practice theory and action research. By co-producing immediately usable insights, experiences and artefacts in the daily practice of SI, this approach enables researchers to gradually create conditions for a transformative trajectory of learning and change in urban governance. I critically appraise four research practices in the context of SI in Dutch urban governance and reflect on the transformative potential of this relational theory–methods package.},

This contribution unpacks the “SI ecosystems” concept, specifying how the empowerment afforded through SI networks rests on (1) local embedding, (2) transnational connectivity and (3) discursive resonance. Charting the variety of network constellations as studied in an international comparison of 20 transnational SI networks, a typology of SI ecosystems is constructed.

Consequently, in recent years, several declarations/manifestos have emerged across the world claiming to protect citizens' digital rights. In 2018, Barcelona, Amsterdam, and NYC city councils formed the Cities' Coalition for Digital Rights (CCDR), an international alliance of global People-Centered Smart Cities—currently encompassing 49 cities worldwide—to promote citizens' digital rights on a global scale. People-centered smart cities programme is the strategic flagship programme by UN-Habitat that explicitly advocates the CCDR as an institutionally innovative and strategic city-network to attain policy experimentation and sustainable urban development. Against this backdrop and being inspired by the popular quote by Hannah Arendt on “the right to have rights”, this article aims to explore what “digital rights” may currently mean within a sample consisting of 13 CCDR global people-centered smart cities: Barcelona, Amsterdam, NYC, Long Beach, Toronto, Porto, London, Vienna, Milan, Los Angeles, Portland, San Antonio, and Glasgow. Particularly, this article examines the (i) understanding and the (ii) prioritisation of digital rights in 13 cities through a semi-structured questionnaire by gathering 13 CCDR city representatives/strategists' responses. These preliminary findings reveal not only distinct strategies but also common policy patterns.},

However, these implementations not only reduce the interdependencies among stakeholders to technocratic Public-Private-Partnership (PPP) models, but also fail to question the identities of strategic stakeholders and how they prioritise their business/social models. These aspects are putting democracy at stake in smart cities. Therefore, this article aims to unfold and operationalise multistakeholders' policy frameworks from the social innovation perspective by suggesting the ex-novo penta-helix framework—including public, private, academia, civic society, and social entrepreneurs/activists—to extend the triple and quadruple-helix frameworks. Based on fieldwork action research conducted from February 2017 to December 2018—triangulating desk research, 75 interviews, and three validation workshops—this article applies the penta-helix framework to map out five strategic dimensions related to (i) multistakeholder helix framework and (ii) the resulting business/social models comparatively in three follower cities of the H2020-Replicate project: Essen (Germany), Lausanne (Switzerland), and Nil{\"{u}}fer (Turkey). For each case study, the findings reveal: (i) a unique multistakeholder composition, (ii) diverse preferences on business/social models, (iii) a regular presence of the fifth helix as intermediaries, and (iv) the willingness to experiment with democratic arrangements beyond the hegemonic PPP.},

We undertook a different benchmarking approach, focused on learning best practices among cities, in late 2008 and early 2009. A benchlearning methodology (BLM) was developed, and a pilot study with 15 European cities was carried out. In this paper, we present the actual impact of the benchmarking study with respect to improvements in services, as the effectiveness of e-government benchmarking has rarely been evaluated. We discuss and analyse the results of a survey carried out in the same 15 cities four years after the pilot study. This paper presents evidence that BLM helped cities to identify good practices that they could learn from, and that some e-services were subsequently improved. The survey reveals that some changes are needed in the benchmarking methodology. The main one is the updating of the BLM bottom-up e-services catalogue, which is deeply discussed within the changing context of Smart Cities, especially the enlargement of the ecosystem of e-services to include citizens, the third sector, entrepreneurs, companies and other actors. A second one is the measurement of the adoption of e-services by citizens, also rarely assessed.},

The research found that, although a supportive regulatory environment helps to create a positive regulatory and cognitive institutional context, normative institutions continue to discourage the positive environment that this context has created. Such a scenario may lead to a ‘talent-in and talent-out' situation that reduces the entrepreneurial potential of the cities. Thus, city governments in emerging economies need to focus on building not only a regulatory environment, but also create a conducive environment for the key stakeholders in the ecosystem to encourage and promote citizen-led IoT interventions that would result in building inclusive smart cities.},

Ubiquitous information communication technologies (ICTs) in SCs enable people to understand and manage cities more efficiently and sustainably, thus improving their life quality. However, a number of potential pitfalls have been noted in the development of SC. This study aims at identifying potential pitfalls in the development of SCs and filling a knowledge gap in this domain. Based on an extensive literature review, four major pitfalls are categorized as system information insecurity, personal privacy leakage, information islands, and digital divide. Possible causes and adverse effects of these pitfalls are discussed with the aid of three international case reviews. In addition, this study looks into existing assessment schemes of SC performance that are mainly focused on the positive and functional capability, but sparingly evaluate the possible downsides. It is argued that a SC cannot claim to be successful by solely measuring how much it has done or what it aims to achieve. While most studies focus on the benefits of SCs, this research reveals the challenges facing city planners. It contributes to the body of knowledge in this regard and also provides an insight into the subject matter. A framework for conducting further research on mitigating potential SC pitfalls has been laid. It is intended to inform practitioners, researchers and policymakers to develop proactive solutions concerning both technological and non-technological aspects at an early stage of SC developments.},

Cities contribute to these problems due to the ever-increasing urbanization. As a solution, smart cities are managed and optimized across traditional boundaries and through the exchange of information between physical objects, citizens, and stakeholders. However, there are barriers in the development of smart cities that should be overcome in order to meet these challenges through smart cities. The main barriers identified in this work are poor private-public participation, utilization of fossil fuels, lack of attention to the environment, insufficient internet technology (IT) infrastructure, and old technology throughout the cities. To overcome these barriers, policies must be implemented to improve private-public participation by encouraging public investments and a wider adoption of electrical vehicles that may act as storage device and provide ancillary services to the electricity grid; reduce the use of private cars; strengthen IT infrastructure, deployment of smart technology to allow residents to monitor and control their energy consumption, installation of roof-top solar panels, and better mobility and efficient public services supported by smart technologies such as IoT (Internet of Things) and information and communication technology (ICT) to enhance the interconnection among smart city systems.},

In the digital era, this struggle is manifested in the work of civil-society organizations calling to expand the boundaries of digital rights such as access to the internet, freedom of speech, and the right to privacy. Alongside their traditional activity of confronting governments and internet organizations, these bodies have also engaged in educating citizens about their rights. In order to shed light on such educational efforts, I examine the activities of four civil-society organizations operating in three countries (Germany, Israel, and the U.S.) by conducting a content analysis of their websites between 2013 and 2015. The results suggest that the organizations' interactions with the public are guided by three main principles: (1) cultural informational framing: delivering accurate technological and political information, which is framed so as to resonate with the cultural premises and everyday lives of the target audiences; (2) personal activism: propelling citizens toward participation, primarily through political clicktivism and by providing them with technological guidance and tools for digital self-protection; and (3) branding digital rights activism: fostering a unique image for a particular organization's digital rights activism, mostly through selling merchandise to citizens. Using these strategies, the organizations aim to construct the social–political–cultural identity of a generation who are knowledgeable, politically active, and aware of their rights in the digital age. The characteristics of this identity are discussed in the conclusion.},

Particularly, this feature article sheds light on two intertwined notions that articulate the technopolitical dimension of the ‘People-Centred Smart Cities' approach: data co-operatives and data sovereignty. Data cooperatives are emerging as a way to share and own data through peer-to-peer (p2p) repositories and data sovereignty is being claimed as a digital right for communities/citizens. Consequently, this feature article aims to open up new research avenues around ‘People-Centred Smart Cities' approach: First, it elucidates how data co-operatives through data sovereignty could be articulated as long as co-developed with communities connected to the long history and analysis of the various forms of co-operatives (technopolitical dimension). Second, it prospectively anticipates the city–regional dimension encompassing data colonialism and data devolution.},

abstract = {Advocated mostly by technology companies, the smart city concept promises participation, democratization and innovative urbanism. Tracking these promises and ideas, this paper explores “smart urbanism” in ten cities from all over Israel. Based on interviews with leading figures in municipalities, smart city consultants and key figures in technological companies (n = 40), the aims of this paper are to assess the efforts of cities to become smart by responding to the following questions: 1. What is guiding the decision-making process in developing technological initiatives? 2. Does context play a role in implementing technological initiatives? 3. How are the residents perceived, and what tools are being used to address residents' digital differences? The key argument of this paper is threefold: first, in the process of becoming a smart city, the roles of public and private actors are blurred, influencing the process of decision making. Second, despite contextual differences, cities adopt similar digital initiatives. Third, technological initiatives that focus on social needs and address inequality in the digital age are still at the margins. The final discussion suggests that most municipalities are still at an early stage of digitization implementation and have the ability to shape and form a vision for the cities as socio-technological ecosystems in a way that will serve their publics as a whole. The paper ends with a call for shifting the focus from the city to society in developing digital initiatives and cultivating smart social urbanism.},

abstract = {Over the two and a half years of its existence, Alphabet/Sidewalk Labs' smart city project in Toronto, Canada has been at the center of successive controversies relating to its proprietary approach to personal data. To address these concerns, Sidewalk Labs suggested putting the data collected in the smart city in a trust. As a “steward of urban data and the public interest,” the Urban Data Trust was expected to protect residents' privacy, establish responsible data sharing standards, and provide individuals with a share in the profits derived from the data gathered about them. This article proposes technoscientific/platform capitalism theories as a theoretical framework in the research on data governance. I situate the Urban Data Trust within a series of policy responses to the problem of extractive data practices. I posit that the company's data governance approach appeals to and sustains a political-economic regime governed by the logic of rent seeking, which aims to entrench the economic dominance of technological monopolies.},

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the use of digital platforms and software for operating remotely and encouraged employers to reshape the workplace for social distancing. But it is not at all clear what these arrangements will mean for cities that have spent the past decade building an ‘innovation complex' around physical density, digital technology and real estate development. On the one hand, many parts of the tech ecosystem that relied on face-to-face interaction – such as coworking spaces, hackathons and venture capitalists' mentoring of start-up founders – have already moved online. On the other hand, cutting tech ecosystems loose from place-based offices, labour markets and institutional networks puts cities' economic future at risk. This could drastically weaken the value of the city's fixed capital of buildings and land, its social capital of institutional networks and communities, and its human capital of workers with tech skills. Yet partnering with tech leaders to ‘reimagine' the city could advance the power of Big Tech. To try to understand which parts of the urban tech ecosystem will likely survive the pandemic, I take a critical look at how the discursive, organisational and geographical spaces of a planetary Silicon Valley culture became embedded in New York between 2010 and 2020.},

abstract = {The last decade has seen “global” and “comparative” forms of urbanism flourish, and critiques thereof expand. While in theory the discussion on the value or shortcomings of global city thinking has thrived, in practice many cities have applied it through expanding international outlooks and collaborations through mounting numbers of partnerships and networks. This has also witnessed a growing sense of competition between peers near and far for investment, talent, and tourism. The “comparative gestures” of cities are increasingly common not just in research but in practice, with expanding ranks of city benchmarking to testify to the popularity of “actually existing” comparative thinking. While there has been a significant rise in the number of city rankings and indexes, as well as increased scholarly interest in comparative urban analysis, how benchmarking is shaping the imagination of those driving urban policymaking or indeed how it relates to global city thinking is still little understood. This study aimed to identify correlations between an appreciation of city rankings and “global city” thinking, especially in cities that have emerged on the “map” of global urbanism. It draws on 170 interviews with a variety of key urban development stakeholders in Dubai, Singapore, and Sydney, focusing on how city rankings relate to the ways we speak of global cities. It suggests a close but nuanced correlation between global city thinking and benchmarking in these cities, but also a wider “map” of comparative gestures than we may have anticipated.},

Critics of deliberative and participatory democracy are highly skeptical that most citizens can engage with such complex issues in good circumstances and these are far from ideal circumstances. The need for rapid action and decision-making is a challenge for inclusivity and quality of deliberation. Additionally, policy responses to the virus need to be even more co-ordinated than usual, which intensifies their complexity. The digitalisation of the public sphere may be seen as a further challenge to deliberating. Furthermore, these are stressful and emotional times, making a considered judgement on these issues potentially challenging. We employ a modified version of the Discourse Quality Index to assess the deliberative quality in two facilitated synchronous digital platforms to consider aspects of data use in light of COVID 19. Our study is the first to perform a comprehensive, systematic and in-depth analysis of the deliberative capacity of citizens in a pandemic.

In this study, we explore the feasibility and acceptability of using Zoom to collect qualitative interview data within a health research context in order to better understand its suitability for qualitative and mixed-methods researchers. We asked 16 practice nurses who participated in online qualitative interviews about their experiences of using Zoom and concurrently recorded researcher observations. Although several participants experienced technical difficulties, most described their interview experience as highly satisfactory and generally rated Zoom above alternative interviewing mediums such as face-to-face, telephone, and other videoconferencing services, platforms, and products. Findings suggest the viability of Zoom as a tool for collection of qualitative data because of its relative ease of use, cost-effectiveness, data management features, and security options.

The article will then approach the function of code at the level of the category, arguing that an analysis of coded computer algorithms enables a supplement to Foucauldian thinking around biopolitics and biopower, of what I call soft biopower and soft biopolitics. These new conceptual devices allow us to better understand the workings of biopower at the level of the category, of using computer code, statistics and surveillance to construct categories within populations according to users' surveilled internet history. Finally, the article will think through the nuanced ways that algorithmic inference works as a mode of control, of processes of identification that structure and regulate our lives online within the context of online marketing and algorithmic categorization. {\textcopyright} 2011, SAGE, Los Angeles, London, New Delhi, and Singapore.

abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to spark a debate by presenting the need for developing data ecosystems in Europe that meet the social and public good while committing to democratic and ethical standards; suggesting a taxonomy of data infrastructures and institutions to support this need; using the case study of Barcelona as the flagship city trailblazing a critical policy agenda of smart cities to show the limitations and contradictions of the current state of affairs; and ultimately, proposing a preliminary roadmap for institutional and governance empowerment that could enable effective data ecosystems in Europe. Design/methodology/approach: This paper draws on lessons learned in previous publications available in the sustainability (Calzada, 2018), regions (Calzada and Cowie, 2017; Calzada, 2019), Zenodo (Calzada and Almirall, 2019), RSA Journal (Calzada, 2019) and IJIS (Calzada, 2020) journals and ongoing and updated fieldwork about the Barcelona case study stemming from an intensive fieldwork action research that started in 2017. The methodology used in these publications was based on the mixed-method technique of triangulation via action research encompassing in-depth interviews, direct participation in policy events and desk research. The case study was identified as the most effective methodology. Findings: This paper, drawing from lessons learned from the Barcelona case study, elucidates on the need to establish pan-European data infrastructures and institutions – collectively data ecosystems – to protect citizens' digital rights in European cities and regions. The paper reveals three main priorities proposing a preliminary roadmap for local and regional governments, namely, advocacy, suggesting the need for city and regional networks; governance, requiring guidance and applied, neutral and non-partisan research in policy; and pan-European agencies, leading and mobilising data infrastructures and institutions at the European level. Research limitations/implications: From the very beginning, this paper acknowledges its ambition, and thus its limitations and clarifies its attempt to provide just an overview rather than a deep research analysis. This paper presents several research limitations and implications regarding the scope. The paper starts by presenting the need for data ecosystems, then structures this need through two taxonomies, all illustrated through the Barcelona case study and finally, concludes with a roadmap consisting of three priorities. The paper uses previous published and ongoing fieldwork findings in Barcelona as a way to lead, and thus encourage the proliferation of more cases through Cities Coalition for Digital Rights (CCDR). Practical implications: This paper presents practical implications for local and regional authorities of the CCDR network. As such, the main three priorities of the preliminary roadmap could help those European cities and regions already part of the CCDR network to establish and build operational data ecosystems by establishing a comprehensive pan-European policy from the bottom-up that aligns with the timely policy developments advocated by the European Commission. This paper can inspire policymakers by providing guidelines to better coordinate among a diverse set of cities and regions in Europe. Social implications: The leading data governance models worldwide from China and the USA and the advent of Big Data are dramatically reshaping citizens' relationship with data. Against this backdrop and directly influenced by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Europe has, perhaps, for the first time, spoken with its own voice by blending data and smart city research and policy formulations. Inquiries and emerging insights into the potential urban experiments on data ecosystems, consisting of data infrastructures and institutions operating in European cities and regions, become increasingly crucial. Thus, the main social implications are for those multi-stakeholder policy schemes already operating in European cities and regions. Originality/value: In previous research, data ecosystems were not directly related to digital rights amidst the global digital geopolitical context and, more specifically, were not connected to the two taxonomies (on data infrastructures and institutions) that could be directly applied to a case study, like the one presented about Barcelona. Thus, this paper shows novelty and originality by also opening up (based on previous fieldwork action research) a way to take strategic action to establish a pan-European strategy among cities and regions through three specific priorities. This paper can ultimately support practice and lead to new research and policy avenues.},

abstract = {The literature on transparency in participatory policy making is flourishing. With the increased digitization of our world, recent work suggests that the digitally-enabled relationships of how policy makers and citizens observe each other may transform policy making in a fundamental way. In this paper, we use complexity theory to examine how digitally-enabled transparency affects the effectiveness of policy making in aligning citizens with the policy goal to improve collective human welfare. We map Kauffman's NKC fitness landscape model, a generalizable theory of co-evolutionary complexity, to the phenomenon of transparent policy making in order to explain how transparency as an enabling generative mechanism encourages citizens to align with the policy goal without exercising central control. In our framework, citizens are agents who co-evolve by adapting to information available in their citizen landscapes. These landscapes represent the citizens' decision context, which policy makers observe and modify throughout an iterative policy cycle. In our study we identify three types of transparencies that relate to three properties of the citizens' decision context: (1) individual decision interdependence; (2) decision bias; and (3) collective decision interdependence. Using conceptual modeling, a form of inquiry combining formal representation with empirical sense making in three policy domains (e-health, smart transportation, and smart energy), we articulate and empirically validate two generative mechanisms that explain transparency effects for each of the three transparencies: (1) orchestration via iterative landscape “tuning” to reduce ambiguity and simplify citizens' alignment with the policy goal; and (2) social learning via information sharing, a co-evolutionary social “nudge” that encourages citizens to be more open to behavioral changes. Our findings have implications for the literature on transparency in participatory policy making as well as the literature on complexity in public policy and public administration.},

abstract = {Rigorous, cutting-edge, interdisciplinary resource on the present and future techno-political challenges of citizenship in data-driven global smart cities from the social innovation perspective.

KEY FEATURES
• Utilizes ongoing, action research fieldwork, comparative case studies for examining current governance issues, and the role of citizens in smart cities.
• Provides definitions of new key citizenship concepts, along with a technopolitical framework and toolkit drawn from a community-oriented perspective.
• Shows how to design smart city governance initiatives, projects and policies based on applied research from the social innovation perspective.
• Highlights citizen's perspective and social empowerment in the AI-driven and algorithmic disruptive post-COVID-19 context in both transitional and experimental frameworks.

DESCRIPTION
Smart City Citizenship provides rigorous analysis for academics and policymakers on the experimental, data-driven, and participatory processes of smart cities to help integrate ICT-related social innovations into urban life.

Unlike other smart city books that are often edited collections, this book focuses on the business domain, grassroots social innovation, and AI-driven algorithmic and techno-political disruptions, also examining the role of citizens and the democratic governance issues raised from an interdisciplinary perspective. As smart city research is a fast-growing topic of scientific inquiry and evolving rapidly, this book is an ideal reference for a much-needed discussion. The book drives the reader to a better conceptual and applied comprehension of smart city citizenship for further democratic hyper-connected-virialised post-COVID-19 societies. In addition, it provides a whole practical roadmap to build smart city citizenship inclusive and multi-stakeholder
interventions through intertwined chapters of the book. Users will find a book that fills the knowledge gap between the purely critical studies on smart cities and those further constructive and highly promising socially innovative interventions using case study fieldwork action research empirical evidence drawn from several cities and regions that are advancing and innovating smart city practices from the citizenship perspective.},

Yet despite numerous examples of this 'urban labelling' phenomenon, we know surprisingly little about so-called smart cities, particularly in terms of what the label ideologically reveals as well as hides. Due to its lack of definitional precision, not to mention an underlying self-congratulatory tendency, the main thrust of this article is to provide a preliminary critical polemic against some of the more rhetorical aspects of smart cities. The primary focus is on the labelling process adopted by some designated smart cities, with a view to problematizing a range of elements that supposedly characterize this new urban form, as well as question some of the underlying assumptions/ contradictions hidden within the concept. To aid this critique, the article explores to what extent labelled smart cities can be understood as a high-tech variation of the 'entrepreneurial city', as well as speculates on some general principles which would make them more progressive and inclusive.},

Invasions of privacy, increasing dataveillance, digital-by-default commercial and civic transactions and the erosion of the democratic sphere are just some of the complex issues in modern societies. Existential questions associated with digital life challenge the individual to come to terms with who they are, as well as their social interactions and realities. In this article, we identify three contemporary normative responses to these complex issues –digital citizenship, digital rights and digital literacy. These three terms capture epistemological and ontological frames that theorise and enact (both in policy and everyday social interactions) how individuals learn to live in digitally mediated societies. The article explores the effectiveness of each in addressing the philosophical, ethical and practical issues raised by datafication, and the limitations of human agency as an overarching goal within these responses. We examine how each response addresses challenges in policy, everyday social life and political rhetoric, tracing the fluctuating uses of these terms and their address to different stakeholders. The article concludes with a series of conceptual and practical ‘action points' that might optimise these responses to the benefit of the individual and society.},

abstract = {A Comprehensive theory of Smart Cities continues to elude scholars. This seems to result from ontological uncertainty surrounding the Smart City and who it serves. Such uncertainty has led to the techno-centric versus human-centric debate currently dominating the Smart City discussion. This paper adopts a systems approach to stratify society into three strata: the individual (micro), organizational (meso), and system (macro). I implement a systematic review of the Smart City literature to examine how Smart Cities are conceptualized. From an analysis of 41 papers, this research identifies a dualistic phenomenon occurring at all points in the stratified city system: sources of innovation (SOI) and Loci of change (LOC). Here, SOI refers to the perceptions of deficiencies which initiate the learning curve of innovation, while LOC refers to the structures which allow the learning curve to disseminate through the system. This analysis highlights an overemphasis on the organizational stratum and insufficient attention to the individual and system strata. To address this shortfall, I introduce the Social Innovation Cycle. This multi-level social innovation framework incorporates the interdependencies of SOI and LOC to link all strata, mitigate power asymmetries, and reduce marginalization. In so doing, I delineate where policy implementation can be directed for holistically developing the Smart City. I recommend that Smart City policy should target the intersection of SOI and LOC in pursuit of human-centricity.},

abstract = {Open government data (OGD) promise to reveal new insights and inform governance decisions related to changing populations, departmental operations, and economic drivers. Yet, where OGD figure prominently in the vision of a smart city, OGD are, in fact, scarce. From production and distribution practices to file types, organizational structure, and repositories, large quantities of potential OGD remain as legacy data trapped in incumbent systems. This article confronts the challenges of legacy data through a constructivist analysis of data wrangling (i.e., converting data into useful formats). The analysis illustrates that wrangling legacy data is more than a rote technical activity. Our findings suggest that smart governance in practice depends on the ways in which social, organizational, and institutional strategies cope with technical change. Further, our research demonstrates that wrangling legacy data is not a discrete problem to overcome but an operating condition defining the rapidly changing landscape of smart governance.},

abstract = {Machine learning algorithms can now identify patterns and correlations in (big) datasets and predict outcomes based on the identified patterns and correlations. They can then generate decisions in accordance with the outcomes predicted, and decision-making processes can thereby be automated. Algorithms can inherit questionable values from datasets and acquire biases in the course of (machine) learning. While researchers and developers have taken the problem of algorithmic bias seriously, the development of fair algorithms is primarily conceptualized as a technical task. In this paper, I discuss the limitations and risks of this view. Since decisions on “fairness measure” and the related techniques for fair algorithms essentially involve choices between competing values, “fairness” in algorithmic fairness should be conceptualized first and foremost as a political question and be resolved politically. In short, this paper aims to foreground the political dimension of algorithmic fairness and supplement the current discussion with a deliberative approach to algorithmic fairness based on the accountability for reasonableness framework (AFR).},

Asserting that human rights can provide such compass, this paper first examines what a human rights-based approach to AI governance entails, and sets out the promise it propagates. Subsequently, it examines the pitfalls associated with human rights, particularly focusing on the criticism that these rights may be too Western, too individualistic, too narrow in scope and too abstract to form the basis of sound AI governance. After rebutting these reproaches, a plea is made to move beyond the calls for a human rights-based approach, and start taking the necessary steps to attain its realisation. It is argued that, without elucidating the applicability and enforceability of human rights in the context of AI; adopting legal rules that concretise those rights where appropriate; enhancing existing enforcement mechanisms and securing an underlying societal infrastructure that enables human rights in the first place, any human rights-based governance framework for AI risks falling short of its purpose.},

The ‘Right to the City' calls for citizens as ‘users' of cities to be integral parts to the socio-technological processes that shape urban space. This article explores how citizens can participate meaningfully, and whether data protection rights can be instrumental to this objective. It does so by analysing several smart city projects in Belgium and the Netherlands that were affected by the GDPR. The findings illustrate that data protection impacts smart city developments, but meaningful influence of citizens, as in the Right to the City, remains very limited. The article argues that already dominant actors and decision-makers remain in control of ‘smart' urban developments, while citizens often lack awareness and data literacy. We suggest that participatory methods for city-making are valuable if they bring about small, incremental changes and that researchers can play an active role in lowering barriers to meaningful participation in practice.},

In the face of insurgent citizen activism and outcry, national governments are looking for options to address this problem-something difficult for many jurisdictions when they lack robust, responsive policy frameworks, even in the wake of the call to act represented by the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In this paper we explore two Australian developments in 2018-2019 which take up the challenge: proposals from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)'s Digital Platforms Inquiry to more stringently regulate social media companies when it comes to data privacy; and the government-mandated creation of a Consumer Data Right. Both policy initiatives seek to grapple with the widening pressure to provide better public domain information, fair and effective options for users to exercise choice over how they configure technologies, and strengthened legal frameworks, enhanced rights, and better avenues redress. However, in our analysis, we find little evidence that the initiatives are joined up, or connected by any common goal of really understanding, or acting on, citizen concerns to do with data privacy threats.},

European city authorities claim that (smart) citizens are as important to a successful smart city program as data and technology are, and that those citizens must be convinced of the benefits and security of such initiatives. This paper examines how the city of Barcelona is marking a transition from the conventional, hegemonic smart city approach to a new paradigm-the experimental city. Through (i) a literature review, (ii) carrying out twenty in-depth interviews with key stakeholders, and (iii) actively participating in three symposiums in Barcelona from September 2017 to March 2018, this paper elucidates how (smart) citizens are increasingly considered decision-makers rather than data providers. This paper considers (i) the implications of the technopolitics of data ownership and, as a result, (ii) the ongoing implementation of the Digital Plan 2017-2020, its three experimental strategies, and the related seven strategic initiatives. This paper concludes that, from the policy perspective, smartness may not be appealing in Barcelona, although the experimental approach has yet to be entirely established as a paradigm.},

Previous research finds that these SCSs are employed by the Chinese state as “surveillance infrastructure” and for social management. This article focuses on a different angle: the public's opinion of SCSs. Based on a cross-regional survey, the study finds a surprisingly high degree of approval of SCSs across respondent groups. Interestingly, more socially advantaged citizens (wealthier, better-educated, and urban residents) show the strongest approval of SCSs, along with older people. While one might expect such knowledgeable citizens to be most concerned about the privacy implications of SCS, they instead appear to embrace SCSs because they interpret it through frames of benefit-generation and promoting honest dealings in society and the economy instead of privacy-violation.},

To this end, we review 341 publications and analyze the frequency of different notions such as data sovereignty, digital sovereignty, and cyber sovereignty. We go on to map agents they concern, in which context they appear, and which values they allude to. While our sample reveals a considerable degree of divergence and an occasional lack of clarity about intended meanings of data sovereignty, we propose a conceptual grid to systematize different dimensions and connotations. Each of them relates in some way to meaningful control, ownership, and other claims to data articulated by a variety of agents ranging from individuals to countries. Data sovereignty alludes to a nuanced mixture of normative concepts such as inclusive deliberation and recognition of the fundamental rights of data subjects.},

@article{Nyers2006,
abstract = {How are citizens and foreigners made and unmade? This article addresses this question by taking Paul Virilio's recent theorizing on the accident as its point of departure. Virilio rethinks the received wisdom that says that the accident is solely that which is unexpected and contingent. According to Virilio, the invention or production of any technology is simultaneously also the production of its accident. To invent the train, he says, is to invent derailment; to invent aircraft is to invent the air crash. Technologies, therefore, can be assessed on the basis of the accidents they produce. In this article, I shift the focus of theories of the accident to the topic of citizenship. What is the primary accident of technologies of citizenship? What exclusions are enabled when the 'accident' is employed as a political category? These questions are addressed through an analysis of the discourse on 'accidental citizenship' in the United States. Accidental citizenship is a pejorative way of describing the 'birthright' citizenship of individuals who were born on US territory to non-citizen parents. I argue with reference to the case of the so-called 'second American Taliban' (Yaser Esam Hamdi) that the discourse of 'accidental citizenship' is being employed as a strategy for making and unmaking American citizenship. Accidental citizenship involves discursive technologies that enable an exceptional logic to be applied to legally normalized subjects, with the effect of excluding those who are included. Consequently, by focusing on the figure of the 'accidental citizen' in post-9/11 United States we can better understand the acts of sovereignty by which citizens and foreigners, friends and enemies are made and unmade.

abstract = {The increasing availability of digital data reflecting economic and human development, and in particular the availability of data emitted as a by-product of people's use of technological devices and services, has both political and practical implications for the way people are seen and treated by the state and by the private sector. Yet the data revolution is so far primarily a technical one: the power of data to sort, categorise and intervene has not yet been explicitly connected to a social justice agenda by the agencies and authorities involved. Meanwhile, although data-driven discrimination is advancing at a similar pace to data processing technologies, awareness and mechanisms for combating it are not. This paper posits that just as an idea of justice is needed in order to establish the rule of law, an idea of data justice – fairness in the way people are made visible, represented and treated as a result of their production of digital data – is necessary to determine ethical paths through a datafying world. Bringing together the emerging scholarly perspectives on this topic, I propose three pillars as the basis of a notion of international data justice: (in)visibility, (dis)engagement with technology and antidiscrimination. These pillars integrate positive with negative rights and freedoms, and by doing so challenge both the basis of current data protection regulations and the growing assumption that being visible through the data we emit is part of the contemporary social contract.},

We performed a comprehensive and systematic literature review extracting 252 definitions of SI through a search of 2,339 documents comprising academic papers, books and book chapters, together research and policy reports. To guide the inductive analysis of pluri-vocal discourses we assume innovation to be a learning-based process involving actors' interactions and social practices. We apply mixed qualitative methodologies, combining content analysis based on an interpretivist ontology with cognitive mapping techniques. Our findings show that SI was introduced as an analytical concept by incipient academic communities and has spread in the last decades as a normative concept fuelled by development and innovation policies. SI is defined by a set of common core elements underpinning three different and interrelated discursive ‘areas': processes of social change, sustainable development and the services sector. We point to some policy implications and a number of promising avenues for research towards the advancement of a broader socio-technical theory of innovation.},

Addressing this call, this paper examines how social innovation fits in the urban sustainability discourse and in what way it empowers urban citizens and their communities towards serving their interests. The findings with respect to 29 cases of social innovation initiatives for environmental sustainability across 9 domains suggest that a large spectrum of sustainability challenges and topics are addressed by existing initiatives, which in turn can refer to different urban spatialities. For each initiative we examine the social innovation process, focusing on the types of involved organizations, the underlying innovation mechanisms as well as the use of technology. In terms of citizen empowerment, we examine the empowerment mode, the main beneficiaries of the innovation, as well as the specific outcome of the initiative. Following this analysis, we arrive to the identification and description of four primary citizen profiles in social innovation for sustainable urban development. We close by calling for further research into the perception, behavior and needs that are associated with the identified citizen profiles and their communities.},

Hannah Arendt is not among the philosophers most quoted by geographers and social scientists interested in the spatial dimension of social life; and when she is, authors typically cite one or two examples or concepts of her work, while neglecting to place her related propositions in the context of the various ways she refers to spatiality or territoriality. This paper aims to give a broad overview of her spatial thinking. More precisely, it presents the various spatial concepts Arendt uses (place, space, territory, world, location, etc.), and suggests that a tri-partite spatial ontology is at work behind her lexicon. Since such an ontological trilogy is never explicit in Arendt's work, it is compared to the architecture of Arendt's explicit theorization which is structured around different sets of concepts (identity/plurality; labour/work/action). Then, the paper explains that an ontological analysis of Arendt's proposals allows us to understand the major issues or tragedies that she focused on as being related to tensions between different forms of spatiality. I conclude that Arendt's extensive contributions in diverse conceptual and empirical fields are intrinsically spatially grounded.},

abstract = {In times of digital pervasion of everyday life, the EU has strengthened a normative idea of European fundamental rights, especially by referring to a strong notion of privacy protection. A normative corridor is evolving with the "right to privacy"at its heart, a right that will be instrumental in shaping the European legal architecture's future structure. In this Article we argue that the constitutional protection of privacy rights is not only of individual relevance but also of major democratic significance: it protects the integrity of the communication structures that underpin democratic self-determination. The debate on privacy protection, however, often lacks a democratic understanding of privacy and misses its public value. Following an interactionist understanding of privacy and a discourse-theoretical model of democracy, our argument puts forward a conceptual link between privacy and the idea of communicative freedom. From this perspective, the substantiation of a European fundamental right to privacy can be seen as a possible contribution to promoting European democracy in general.},

This paper aims to clarify the meaning of the word “smart” in the context of cities through an approach based on an in-depth literature review of relevant studies as well as official documents of international institutions. It also identifies the main dimensions and elements characterizing a smart city. The different metrics of urban smartness are reviewed to show the need for a shared definition of what constitutes a smart city, what are its features, and how it performs in comparison to traditional cities. Furthermore, performance measures and initiatives in a few smart cities are identified.},

We propose a modelling approach that combines four computational techniques merging statistical, inference and artificial intelligence tools. We validate our findings with two external datasets recording 42,151 additional NPIs from 226 countries. Our results indicate that a suitable combination of NPIs is necessary to curb the spread of the virus. Less disruptive and costly NPIs can be as effective as more intrusive, drastic, ones (for example, a national lockdown). Using country-specific ‘what-if' scenarios, we assess how the effectiveness of NPIs depends on the local context such as timing of their adoption, opening the way for forecasting the effectiveness of future interventions.},

In this article, we report the findings of a project in which we used cultural probes to generate discussion about personal digital dataveillance. Our findings suggest the prevailing dominance of tacit assumptions about the uses and benefits of dataveillance as well as fears and anxieties about its possible misuse. Participants were able to identify a range of ways in which dataveillance is conducted, but were more aware of obvious commercial and some government actors. There was very little identification of the types of dataveillance that are used by national security and policing agencies or of illegal access by hackers and cybercriminals. We found that the participants recognised the value of both personal data and the big aggregated data sets that their own data may be part of, particularly for their own convenience. However, they expressed concern or suspicion about how these data may be used by others, often founded on a lack of knowledge about what happens to their data. The major question for our participants was where the line should be drawn. When does personal dataveillance become too intrusive, scary or creepy? What are its drawbacks and risks? Our findings suggest that experimenting with innovative approaches to elicit practices and understandings of personal digital data offers further possibilities for greater depth and breadth of social research with all types of social groups.},

It departs from Agre's classic distinction between surveillance and capture by examining the sociotechnical claims of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) as requiring totalising surveillance of passengers and environment in order to operate. By doing so, it contributes to the ongoing debate on the commodification and platformisation of life, paying attention to the under-explored infrastructural requirements of certain digital technologies, rather than its business model. The article addresses four distinct characteristics of infrastructural surveillance: the aggregation of data, initialisation of protocols limiting possible actions, the prioritisation of distributed modes of governance and the enclosure of the driver in a personalised bubble of sovereign power. Ultimately, unlike previous modes of computer privacy in which activities are being constructed in real time from a set of institutionally standardised parts specified by a captured ontology, we observe the creation of new ontologies.},

Consequently, in recent years, several declarations/manifestos have emerged across the world claiming to protect citizens' digital rights.

People-centered smart cities programme is the strategic flagship programme by UN-Habitat that explicitly advocates the CCDR as an institutionally innovative and strategic city-network to attain policy experimentation and sustainable urban development. Against this backdrop and being inspired by the popular quote by Hannah Arendt on “the right to have rights”, this article aims to explore what “digital rights” may currently mean within a sample consisting of 13 CCDR global people-centered smart cities: Barcelona, Amsterdam, NYC, Long Beach, Toronto, Porto, London, Vienna, Milan, Los Angeles, Portland, San Antonio, and Glasgow. Particularly, this article examines the (i) understanding and the (ii) prioritisation of digital rights in 13 cities through a semi-structured questionnaire by gathering 13 CCDR city representatives/strategists' responses.

Most subjective measures used in practice are unvalidated, and their relationship to system usage is unknown. The present research develops and vandales new scales for two specific variables, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which are hypothesized to be fundamental determinants of user acceptance. Definitions for these two variables were used to develop scale items that were pretested for content validity and then tested for reliability and construct validity in two studies involving a total of 152 users and four application programs. The measures were refined and stream-lined, resulting in two six-item scales with reliabilities of .98 for usefulness and .94 for ease of use. The scales exhibited high convergent, discriminant, and factorial validity. Perceived usefulness was significantly correlated with both self-reported current usage (r=.63, Study 1) and self-predicted future usage (r=.85, Study 2). Perceived ease of use was also significantly correlated with current usage (r=.45, Study 1) and future usage (r=.59, Study 2). In both studies, usefulness had a significantly greater correlation with usage behavior than did ease of use. Regression analyses suggest that perceived ease of use may actually be a causal antecedent to perceived usefulness, as opposed toy a parallel, direct determinant of system usage. Implications are drawn for future research on user acceptance.},

Or will a growing reliance on IT lead to more inequality by leaving behind certain portions of the population including people with disabilities? In this paper, the authors draw on nationally representative data regarding Americans' Internet uses to (1) identify the extent to which people with disabilities are embracing use of the Internet; (2) how their use of the Internet compares with the Internet uses of the rest of the population; (3) how having a disability relates to and interacts with other social statuses (e.g. socioeconomic status, age, gender) with regard to Internet use; and (4) what explains these trends. They draw on representative data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census of the United States to answer these questions. It is found that people with disabilities are less likely to live in households with computers, are less likely to use computers and are less likely to be online. However, once socioeconomic background is controlled for, it is found that people with hearing disabilities and those who have limited walking ability are not less likely to be Internet users.

Yet rural areas are among those most excluded from fast broadband developments. Although this is partly due to technological/economic barriers in reaching more remote locations, even where technology is available, adoption can still be low in rural areas. This article explores the problems of providing broadband in rural Britain, considers various technological approaches and concludes with key development areas for policy and government. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.},

abstract = {Despite the efforts devoted to the analysis of the digital divide over the last years, the regional evidence on this issue is still scarce. Within this context, the goals of this paper are twofold: (1) measuring the digital divide across the regions of the 27 Member States and within each country and (2) explaining the observed regional disparities. The analysis leads to identify Dutch regions as the Top-10 in ICT, while Greece and Bulgaria occupy the Bottom-10. Therefore, results show that the regional digital divide reflects to some extent the income gap. However, regional policy seems to be having some positive implications for technology adoption. In particular, the rural-versus-urban dimension of the digital gap appears to be less important than it is usually claimed to. Likewise, some evidence is found of the role of cultural and institutional factors in ICT adoption, an issue that has not been previously analyzed at the regional level. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The extent and the nature of this divide depend on the kind of access defined. Considering the possession of hardware, growing divides among different categories of income, employment, education, age, and ethnicity can be proved to have existed in the 1980s and 1990s according to official American and Dutch statistics. If only by effects of saturation, these gaps will more or less close. However, it is shown that differential access of skills and usage is likely to increase. The growth of a usage gap is projected. Multivariate analyses of Dutch official statistics reveal the striking effect of age and gender as compared to education. The usage gap is related to the evolution of the information and network society. Finally, policy perspectives are discussed.},

abstract = {This article presents the results of a quantitative study (n = 1,058) of the gender divide in ICT attitudes. In general, females had more negative attitudes towards computers and the Internet than did men. Results indicate a positive relationship between ICT experience and ICT attitudes. This experience is measured by period of time using a computer and self-perceived computer and Internet experience. Further analyses on the impact of gender on this correlation of ICT experience and ICT attitudes were conducted by means of a multivariate model. General Linear Model (GLM) analysis revealed that there was a significant effect of gender, computer use, and self-perceived computer experience on computer anxiety attitudes, as well as several significant interaction effects. Males were found to have less computer anxiety than females; respondents who have used computers for a longer period of time and respondents with a higher self-perception of experience also show less computer anxiety. However, the GLM plot shows that the influence of computer experience works in different ways for males and females. Computer experience has a positive impact on decreasing computer anxiety for men, but a similar effect was not found for women. The model was also tested for computer liking and Internet-liking factors. {\textcopyright} Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

Second, digital competency and online service usage were also significantly different among the three groups. Third, PC usage ability, mobile usage ability, and diversity of online usage significantly influenced the digital divide index in all age groups. Fourth, residential duration in Korea significantly decreased the digital divide index for groups in their 30s and 40s. Fifth, Loneliness significantly increased the digital divide index for groups in their 20s. Sixth, depression significantly increased the digital divide index for groups in their 30s.

This study adds context to the understanding of the digital divide by demonstrating differences in Internet connectedness, a multidimensional concept that includes consideration of the scope and intensity of the relationship that people develop with the Internet. Age is shown to be significantly associated not just with access, but with a tendency to pursue a more narrow range of personal goals online and with a pattern of connecting to the Internet from a smaller range of places. Nonetheless, older respondents evaluate the Internet to be as central to their lives as younger people do.

Methods. The study employs data collected by the General Social Survey (GSS) in 2000, and relates access, communication levels, frequency of use, and types of sites used to gender and other relevant variables. The relevant variables are analyzed by multivariate analysis. Results. Access to the web was independent of gender, but was related to education, race, income, age, and marital status. Women were less likely than men to chat on the web, but were slightly more likely to use email, and they utilized different types of sites than men. Conclusions. Women access the web as frequently as men, but they communicate on the Internet differently than men, are online less than men, and utilize different types of websites than men.

Making cities more sustainable is a global priority, which is highlighted by ‘Sustainable Cities and Communities' being listed as one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) adopted by United Nations Member States in 2015. This Virtual Special Issue (VSI) explores the implementation and assessment of policies and technologies that contribute to the transition to a sustainable, energy efficient and regenerative society. We organized the issue according to four main research themes: 1) Renewable Energy Systems (i.e., different types of systems, qualitative assessments and public acceptance); 2) Sustainable Built Environment (which includes construction, operation and refurbishment); 3) Multi-Scale Models (considering urban sustainability transition from building to districts, or cities and regions to multi-country comparisons and their scaling across different countries); and 4) Governance and Policy (climate change mitigation and adaptation plans/policies that are reported across countries, urban services and infrastructures). This paper serves two purposes. The first is to provide an analysis about patterns, correlations and synergies found across the different topics that have been addressed over the last 20 years in the literature about cities' sustainability paths. A bibliometric analysis and a contingency matrix show the degree of correlation between scientific journals and main topics addressed by published articles. Secondly, the paper acts as an Editorial to the VSI, introducing the wealth of research articles and topics included in it. Both the bibliometric analysis and the papers published in this VSI demonstrate the interconnectedness of energy consumption, pollutant emissions and the competition for finite resources. The aim is to present advances and challenges of this exciting and ever-evolving research field to inform and guide future studies of urban sustainability.},

In fact, urbanization has been not only shown to promote economic growth and improve the livelihood of people but also can increase demands of regional logistics. Therefore, a better understanding of the relationship between urbanization and regional logistics is important for China's future sustainable development. The development of urban residential area and heterogeneous, modern society as well regional logistics are running two abreast. The regional logistics can promote the development of new-type urbanization jointly by promoting industrial concentration and logistics demand, enhancing the residents' quality of life and improving the infrastructure and logistics technology. In this paper, the index system and evaluation model for evaluating the development of regional logistics and the new-type urbanization are constructed. Further, the econometric analysis is utilized such as correlation analysis, co-integration test, and error correction model to explore relationships of the new-type urbanization development and regional logistics development in Liaoning Province. The results showed that there was a long-term stable equilibrium relationship between the new-type urbanization and regional logistics. The findings have important implications for Chinese policymakers that on the path towards a sustainable urbanization and regional reverse, this must be taken into consideration. The paper concludes providing some strategies that might be helpful to the policymakers in formulating development policies for sustainable urbanization.},

abstract = {In recent decades, our cities are increasingly expected to become more sustainable urban forms, with many added determinants. A multitude of city concepts has therefore been contrived. The most time-honored and prominent concept is the “sustainable city,” which is depicted as a model urban form and thereafter more city concepts have come into being. However, it is not clear for all the concepts, for instance, “eco-cities,” “smart city,” “sustainable city,” and “resilient city,” what are the underpinning building blocks within each concept and how these concepts correlate with each other. This bibliometric study organizes this in conducting a descriptive summary, a clustering analysis, and multidimensional scaling of major city concepts, by establishing a co-word matrix of high-frequency keywords occurring in the Science Citations Index (SCI) and Social Science Citations Index (SSCI) databases. In addition to summarizing the evolution of these concepts, it analyzes the composition of each city concept and the core issues addressed by each city type. Also investigated are the correlations between the city concepts with a statistical analysis of the clusters of literature in one concept that overlap or connect to other clusters in another. From this, it is shown that, under the two umbrella terms of “sustainable city” and “smart city,” the “? -city” literature has developed in a variety of distinctive ways.},

A full extended layerwise method (Full-XLWM) is developed in this study to avoid the dependence of the delamination region on the finite elements. In the Full-XLWM, the delamination is simulated by the Heaviside function and branch function of the displacement field in the thickness direction, whilst transverse cracks are modeled by the extended finite element method (XFEM). The weak discontinuous function along the thickness direction is adopted to consider the interlaminar interfaces. The delamination front is independent on the meshing as the level set function is employed, so the analysis model of delamination can be established from a uniform finite element meshing. In the numerical examples, the static analysis of the composite plates and spherical shells are investigated for the straight and circular delamination front.},

abstract = {As the world enters a new round of large-scale urbanization, the coordination of a balance between social, economic, and environmental systems to promote sustainable urban development has become a global focus. Scholars have explored sustainable urbanization, collected relevant literature, and analyzed the influence of research in different countries, finding that China's influence is second only to that of the US. Accordingly, this study uses the literature in China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), the world's largest Chinese database. It selects 3640 studies on sustainable urbanization from Web of Science and Scopus (W&S), and CNKI. Using the bibliometric method in Citespace, it systematically analyzes the research status, development course, and potential trends of research on sustainable urbanization. The results show that: (1) The number of studies on sustainable urbanization in CNKI is decreasing by year, while it has increased gradually in W&S. China currently has the most literature in the field of sustainable urbanization. The US, China, and Germany have the most influential studies. (2) W&S and CNKI each have their separate and complementary emphases. (3) The two datasets are more similar in terms of the nature of their research institutions, but cooperation between the institutions is closer in W&S than in CNKI. There are no aggregation or scaling effects in the Chinese research institutions. The Chinese Academy of Sciences and Hong Kong Polytechnic University are leaders in this field. (4) The top five topics in the studies from W&S are urban development models and public administration, urban planning issues, protection of urban ecosystems, urban land-use changes, and pollution and resource consumption during urbanization. The top five topics in the CNKI studies are strategy of sustainable development, urban development, urbanization and population urbanization, land financing and urban economics, and urban development planning. The construction of urban ecosystems with reasonable structure, efficient processes, and complete functions is an important breakthrough in the application of sustainable urbanization. Reasonably controlling the pace of urban expansion, efficiently coordinating urban and rural development, formulating evidence-based urban development strategies, and ensuring the living standard of urban settlements are the key problems in sustainable urbanization, and will become important directions for related future research.},

abstract = {Rapid urbanization presents one of the most urgent challenges of our times. Cities must cope with poor air quality, heat island effects, increased flood risk and the frequency/severity of extreme events (e.g., droughts and heat waves), increasing crime and social inequity, poverty and degraded urban environments, amongst other negative consequences. Climate change adaptation and mitigation as well as sustainable management are therefore key challenges for cities in Europe and around the world. What must be developed therefore is a robust, wide evidence-base and reference framework of nature-based solutions (NBS) – measures that mimic the complex features and processes of natural ecosystems – for local/regional city authorities and other policy and decision makers to increase climate resilience and address inclusive urban regeneration in cities. In response to this need, we propose an applicative framework for NBS using the structure of the DPSIR (Driving force–Pressure–State–Impact–Response) model, in conformity with European Community standards. Indeed, under the umbrella of the EC's Framework Program – Horizon 2020 – international institutions, scientific experts and policy makers worldwide are seeking to increase collaboration with cities to enhance ecosystem services and develop the evidence-base for the economic, social and environmental benefits of nature-based solutions. They are eager to exchange knowledge and inspire positive action for nature in urban areas to meet their growing social and environmental challenges. The time has come to acknowledge NBS as the most fitting response to the numerous challenges posed by our changing climate and for the realization of sustainable and healthy cities. It is hoped that this article will pioneer others in settling the issue for NBS as the undisputable answer to challenged urban landscapes and societies globally.},

abstract = {Urban population has been increasing and it is estimated to reach 70% of the total population in the world by 2050. Governments are facing greater challenges every time in providing inhabitants with a good quality of life in their cities. Many cities around the world have developed sustainable urban development plans for leading their urbanization process towards a desired status of urban sustainability. Urban sustainability indicators have been selected as main elements for communicating the status of the practice, which help to determine how successful strategies and policies enforced have been in the attainment of sustainability goals. Different practices use different indicators according to their particular needs, and these have been selected under different methods. However, whilst there are cases where urban sustainability indicators are effectively in use, the experiences gained from each practice have not been shared and used for the development of new urban development plans and for improving the decision-making process in the selection of indicators. This paper examines 9 different practices and proposes a comparative basis, namely, International Urban Sustainability Indicators List (IUSIL), for allowing the better understanding of drivers and goals of each practice and identifying under what circumstances various practices selected their indicators. Discussions made on the comparative analysis are categorized in four different dimensions: environmental, economic, social and governance. Research results show how comparative basis can lead to knowledge sharing between different practices, which can be used to guide the selection of indicators of sustainable urbanization plans and improve the effective communication of the status of practices. The study not only reveals how different indicators are selected but also suggests the need for consistent processes of choosing indicators based on the benchmarks obtained from best practices. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In order to understand the coupling and coordination relationship between urbanization and eco-environment, we took the city of Hangzhou as an example and evaluated quantitatively evolution of the relationship between urbanization and the eco-environment development during 2003-2016, by establishing the assessment indicator system and applying it to the coupling coordination model. The results show that: ①economic urbanization and eco-environment pressure make the greatest contributions to the urbanization subsystem and the eco-environment subsystem, respectively; ②compared with the comprehensive development level subsystems, the ratio between $\alpha$-urbanization and $\beta$-eco-environment has little influence on the coupling coordination system; ③the coupling coordination degree evolved from the stage of "unbalanced development with hindered urbanization" to "superiorly balanced development with lagging urbanization", and then to a stage of "superiorly balanced development with a lagging eco-environment". The problem of lagging eco-environment is severe due to the rapid development of urbanization. Results from this study therefore suggest that the adverse pressure of urbanization on eco-environment deserves more attention when design and implement the urbanization strategies.},

abstract = {Municipal infrastructure is a fundamental facility for the normal operation and development of an urban city and is of significance for the stable progress of sustainable urbanization around the world, especially in developing countries. Based on the municipal infrastructure data of the prefecture-level cities in China, municipal infrastructure development is assessed comprehensively using a FA (factor analysis) model, and then the stochastic model STIRPAT (stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence and technology) is examined to investigate key factors that influence municipal infrastructure of cities in various stages of urbanization and economy. This study indicates that the municipal infrastructure development in urban China demonstrates typical characteristics of regional differentiation, in line with the economic development pattern. Municipal infrastructure development in cities is primarily influenced by income, industrialization and investment. For China and similar developing countries under transformation, national public investment remains the primary driving force of economy as well as the key influencing factor of municipal infrastructure. Contribution from urbanization and the relative consumption level, and the tertiary industry is still scanty, which is a crux issue for many developing countries under transformation. With economic growth and the transformation requirements, the influence of the conventional factors such as public investment and industrialization on municipal infrastructure development would be expected to decline, meanwhile, other factors like the consumption and tertiary industry driven model and the innovation society can become key contributors to municipal infrastructure sustainability.},

The conference set out to review the impacts of the transformation of human socio-economic activities on land-use change and associated policy making from both a Chinese and a global perspective. The contributions to this themed issue provide conceptual-theoretical and empirical studies on the topic, covering five themes: key issues of land use and sustainability, urbanization and farmland protection, rural transforamtion and reconstruction, urban-rural interaction in a changing society, and land resources engineering and land use policy. China has undergoneintense socio-economic transformations during recent decades which has affected all sectors of the country's economy. The rapid urbanization has seriously affected rural areas, leading to the intensification of “rural disease” issues and farmland losses, and the implementation of rural revitalization in China is imperative. In view of this, the papers make a compelling call for more systematic research on land use sustainability and emphasize the challenges for futher research on land use and rural revitalization in China.},

However, sometimes these interactions are difficult to quantify. Through an analysis of the structure and functions of the sustainable urbanization system, this paper introduced synergetic theory and constructed a sustainable urbanization synergy system (SUSS) with five subsystems; demographic change, economic development, spatial structure, environmental quality, and social development; to study the synergistic development and orderly evolution trend of the sustainable urbanization composite system. Using sustainable urbanization in Henan province as an example, a mathematical quantitative model was established to measure the subsystem order degrees and the composite system synergy degree from 2006 to 2015. The results were consistent with the actual situation and indicated that over time, sustainable urbanization in Henan developed towards a more harmonious and orderly state, though the overall synergy degree was not high. It was found that the model was a sound basis for scientific judgment and effective decision-making when seeking to coordinate sustainable urbanization.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers. The urbanization process can have a profound impact on economic development, human society, natural resources, and the environment, and is closely related to sustainable development. As a developing country, China has experienced rapid urbanization that has brought forth not only economic development and income growth but also environmental degradation and an urban-rural income gap. To promote sustainable development during the urbanization process, it is necessary to assess the relative status of sustainable urbanization performance in the different regions of China and explore its driving forces. This study developed an indicator system against the background of China's urbanization and adopted an improved entropy method to assess the social, economic, and environmental dimensions of urbanization performance in China at both the national and provincial levels. The results suggest that the national sustainable urbanization performance has improved greatly since 1990, in accordance with the increase in the urbanization rate. However, the environmental and social dimensions of urbanization performance lagged greatly behind that of the economic dimension. There was a large regional disparity among the different provinces in the 2000-2014 study period, with the highest aggregate sustainable urbanization levels concentrated in the eastern coastal region, in addition to the spatial disparity decreasing over the study period. Furthermore, the panel data regression analysis indicated that the market was the leading driving force for the different dimensions of sustainable urbanization in China, followed by intrinsic and administration forces. Finally, it is recommended that differentiated strategies should be pursued in different regions. Whereas western and central China mostly need to improve the developmental level of urban sustainability by providing more infrastructure, the eastern provinces require better coordination of the different dimensions of sustainable urbanization. This study not only may provide some policy implications for China to promote its sustainable urbanization but also may serve as a reference for other developing countries.},

abstract = {The “China Dream” is an “Urban Dream”. Urbanization is an inevitable requirement for promoting social progress. The Chinese government sees sustainable urbanization as an engine of modernization and economic growth. And the country's urbanization has followed a unique course and is perhaps the greatest human-resettlement experiment in the world history, unprecedentedly transforming the Chinese society in a very short period of time. Yet problems have arisen during the historical process, China's unique path to urbanization has avoided many of pitfalls existing in the developing countries in Africa, Asia and South America. This paper attempts to conclude the good jobs as well as problems in China's urbanizing process which might provide successful experience for the underdeveloped nations and regions to promote urbanization. The most brilliant achievement of urbanization in China is that thousands of years' agriculture-dominated country has ended and a new urbanized country has formed, which only consumed several decades. The country's urban infrastructure, living conditions and public service for urban residents have made great improvements. The fostering urban agglomerations are considered to lead the country's socio-economic transformation and possess the greatest potential for the urbanization and economic growth in the coming decades. In general, the traditional land-centered urbanization in China is a typical “incomplete urbanization” and “low-quality urbanization”, presenting impressive characteristics of “four highs and five lows”—high investment, consumption, emission and expansion, and low level, quality, harmony degree, inclusiveness and sustainability. Undoubtedly, the traditional urbanization of China is increasingly difficult to continue and the transformation process should be speeded up as soon as possible. The country should actively explore a people-oriented new-type urbanization way, i.e. an intensive, efficient, rural-urban integration, harmonious and sustainable urbanization model.},

As a collaborative effort of the Ecological Research as Education Network (EREN), we sampled freshwater turtle populations in 11 states across the central and eastern United States. Contrary to expectations, we found a significant positive relationship between proportions of mature female painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) and urbanization. We did not detect a relationship between urbanization and proportions of immature turtles. Urbanization may alter the thermal environment of nesting sites such that more females are produced as urbanization increases. Our approach of creating a collaborative network of scientists and students at undergraduate institutions proved valuable in terms of testing our hypothesis over a large spatial scale while also allowing students to gain hands-on experience in conservation science.},

In this context, this paper aims to provide better understanding of the geospatial dimensions of the urbanization and landscape changes in two megacities of Southeast Asia. Specifically, we examine and compare the intensities and spatial patterns of ULCs in Metro Manila, Philippines and Bangkok Metropolitan Region (Bangkok MR), Thailand, during the 1990-2000 and 2000-2010 periods, using remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) tools and techniques. In the measurement of ULC intensity, an intensity scale is proposed to determine whether the rate of ULC during a particular time interval, i.e., 1990-2000 or 2000-2010, relative to the uniform intensity that is based on the whole time extent, i.e., 1990-2010, is very slow, slow, medium slow/fast, fast and very fast. To characterize the spatial patterns of ULCs, the concepts of the diffusion-coalescence urban growth theory were applied. The results revealed that for Metro Manila, its ULC was more intense during the 1990s (fast) than in the 2000s (slow). For Bangkok MR, it was more intense during the 2000s (medium fast) than during the 1990s (medium slow). The results also revealed that Metro Manila has been in the process of coalescence, while Bangkok MR is still largely in the process of diffusion and expansion. In this paper, we also discuss some of the possible factors influencing ULC intensity trends and spatial patterns, the advantages of the methods used for ULC analysis and some land use policy-related development plans for the two megacities.},

Such an assessment is now a critical perspective in understanding the manner in which city development affects local and regional environment. Research in urban metabolism is a relatively new and ever-evolving area that encompasses a multidisciplinary field and moves toward a combined natural and social science. This paper offers a verifiable and reproducible systematic literature review of sustainable urban metabolism, analyzing and scrutinizing 813 papers for co-occurrence of keywords. This review aims to answer two research questions: (i) what are the prevailing themes in urban metabolism and (ii) how have these themes measured the support of cities toward sustainability? Through clustering analysis based on bibliometric method, four different focuses and their main keywords were outlined. The four clusters are general concept, methodology, policy issue, and specific element clusters, and their core keywords are city, energy, relationship, network, sustainability, China, indicator, economy, country, recycling, disposal, and recovery. Urban metabolism themes have evolved from nutrient flows and individual element treatment concerning industrial ecology in the course of the past century to ecological views of complex urban networks. The taxonomy of themes and the analysis of their evolution lead to further research agenda on the general framework of urban metabolism toward sustainability.},

abstract = {Urbanization is one of the fundamental characteristics of the European civilization. It gradually spread from Southeast Europe around 700 B.C., across the whole continent. Cities and the urban networks they formed were always an important factor in the development and shaping of their surrounding regions. Polarization of territory between urban and rural and accessibility are still important aspects in landscape dynamics. Urbanization and its associated transportation infrastructure define the relationship between city and countryside. Urbanization, expressed as the proportion of people living in urban places shows a recent but explosive growth reaching values around 80% in most European countries. Simultaneously the countryside becomes abandoned. Thinking, valuing and planning the countryside is done mainly by urbanites and future rural development is mainly focused upon the urban needs. Thinking of urban places with their associated rural hinterland and spheres of influence has become complex. Clusters of urban places, their situation in a globalizing world and changing accessibility for fast transportation modes are some new factors that affect the change of traditional European cultural landscapes. Urbanization processes show cycles of evolution that spread in different ways through space. Urbanization phases developed at different speeds and time between Northern and Southern Europe. Main cities are affected first, but gradually urbanization processes affect smaller settlements and even remote rural villages. Functional urban regions (FURs) are a new concept, which is also significant for landscape ecologists. Local landscape change can only be comprehended when situated in its general geographical context and with all its related dynamics. Patterns of change are different for the countryside near major cities, for metropolitan villages and for remote rural villages. Planning and designing landscapes for the future requires that this is understood. Urbanized landscapes are highly dynamic, complex and multifunctional. Therefore, detailed inventories of landscape conditions and monitoring of change are urgently needed in order to obtain reliable data for good decision-making. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Traffic collisions are incidents with high fatality rate which generate billions of US dollars of loss worldwide each year. Post-collision scene reconstruction, which involves knowledge of multiple disciplines, is an important approach to restore the traffic collision and infer the cause of it. This paper uses software CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and SciMAT to conduct a visualization study of knowledge mapping on the literature of traffic collision scene reconstruction from 2001 to 2021 based on the Web of Science database. Knowledge mapping is a cutting-edge research method in scientometric, which has been widely applied in medicine and informatics. Compared with traditional literature review, knowledge mapping with visual techniques identifies hot keywords and key literature in the field more scientifically, and displays them in schematic diagrams intuitively which allows to further predict potential hotspots. A total of 803 original papers are retrieved to analyze and discuss the evolution of the field in the past 20 years, from macro to micro, in term of background information, popular themes, and knowledge structure. Results indicate the number of publications in this field is limited, and collaborations among authors and among institutions are insufficient. In the meantime, mappings imply the top three hot themes being scene reconstruction, computer technology, and injuries. The introduction of AI related technologies, such as neural networks and genetic algorithms, into collision reconstruction would be a potential research direction.},

abstract = {Fish, a major portion of the global food production, is highly nutritious, perishable, and susceptible to pre-harvest and postmortem factors. Conventional methods are laborious, time-consuming, and do not support real-time or infield applications in fish quality monitoring. Sensors are promising alternatives; therefore, novel applications of the colorimetric, electrochemical, enzyme, and gas sensors in fish quality monitoring based on detection principles are highlighted in this study. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for quality management and prediction, leveraging large data sets generated by onsite sensors. The current novel sensors for fish quality detection lack high precision, robustness, detection limits, sensitivity, specificity, flexibility, and low power consumption. This review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of fish quality indicators, novel sensors, and machine learning, critically analyzing research gaps in combination with fish quality prediction and pattern recognition. Furthermore, current challenges are emphasized, and future perspectives are also discussed.},

This minimax estimation problem is formulated as an equivalent event-triggered linear exponential quadratic Gaussian problem. It is then shown that this problem can be solved via dynamic programming and a newly defined information state. As the solution to this dynamic programming problem is computationally intractable, a one-step event-triggered minimax estimation problem is further formulated and solved, where an a posteriori relative entropy is introduced as a measure of the discrepancy between probability measures. The resulting estimator is shown to evolve in recursive closed-form expressions. For the multi-sensor system scenario, a one-step event-triggered minimax estimator is also presented in a sequential fusion way. Finally, comparative simulation examples are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed one-step event-triggered minimax estimators.},

However, knowing what exactly this entails and how it can be achieved is not always quite straightforward and requires thorough theoretical and empirical exploration. Consequently, we present a systematic deconstruction of the inclusive city concept in order to develop a better understanding of the main features and dimensions; this is done by means of both a bibliometric analysis and qualitative literature review. The results indicate that inclusiveness is multidimensional and comprised of spatial, social, environmental, economic, and political dimensions in which the characteristics of participation, equity, accessibility and sustainability are sometimes interwoven. Overall, the inclusive city is not merely a precondition for the creation of just space, well-being, and environmental responsibility, but also an opportunity to take stock of interests of stakeholders in cities and to create local public value. The findings have implications for urban policy and practice, more specifically, the clarification of the inclusive city concept and conceptual dimensions will provide significant reference for policymakers and practitioners to make prudent decisions in the process of creating an inclusive city.},

However, the co-themed studies of these two terms are relatively less sufficient, and more detailed integrated research should be processed. This study uses CiteSpace to do bibliometric analysis regarding the knowledge structure and evolution of green marketing in sustainable consumption with visualization. Results show that green marketing in sustainable consumption is a prosperous topic with increasing annual publications. Besides, there are relatively complicated collaboration networks among institutions and strong extensive cross-regional collaborations, and the most productive authors may not be highly cited, which contradicts with former results of other studies. Furthermore, “green,” “consumption,” “sustainability,” and “consumer” are more welcomed in this research domain and are at the dominating status in the recent studies; some new research directions have emerged, and research focuses are more diversified, implying the multidisciplinary and comprehensiveness nature of this research domain. This study enjoys novelties by combining green marketing and sustainable consumption, constructing a knowledge framework of this domain, revealing current gaps, and proposing key research directions in the future, which cover the deficiencies of former studies and enrich the knowledge system, and are significant references for scholars to explore the research of this domain in the future more effectively and efficiently.},

abstract = {Rapid urbanization, particularly in developing countries, is widely regarded as one of the most critical global issues in the 21 st century. It is known to exacerbate urban heat island effects, a phenomenon that could affect the livability of cities and the lives and comfort of more than half of the world population who are now living in urban areas. The issue on how to mitigate the impacts of this phenomenon and help urban dwellers adapt to it, has been, and continues to be, an important topic in the context of landscape design and urban planning. This study sought to examine the cooling effects of different land cover types from the perspectives of landscape composition and configuration using Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS data. Various spatial and statistical approaches, including urban-rural gradient, grid-based, landscape metrics, and scatter plot, were employed to analyze the derived land cover and land surface temperature (LST) maps. The results showed that both forest and water had a cooling effect during daytime in Hangzhou. The heat core in Hangzhou was situated close to the central business district and the variance in LST in urban and rural recorded at 3.22 ℃. The correlation of forest density with mean LST could be detected in both large (690 m) and small (210 m) grids, whereas the correlation of water density with mean LST was only observed in small grids. In general, forest with high aggregation and complex shape behave best in cooling LST while huge and complete water bodies had better cooling effect than scattered water patches. Besides, the minimum cooling scale of forest and water were proximately 120 m and 150 m from the cooling resources to the neighboring areas, respectively. The findings were considered valuable for urban planners to spatially and architecturally build and arrange the cooling land cover resources, eventually to fulfill the Chinese government's new plan of building “livable cities”.},

In this study, using Landsat long-time series satellite images, we attempted to examine the dynamics of surface urban heat islands (SUHI) in Hangzhou from 2000 to 2020. Directional analysis, correlation analysis, and stepwise regression analysis were employed to detect the relationships between land surface temperature (LST) and landscape patterns. The results show that the changes of SUHI were mainly due to the urban expansion in suburban areas, and the intensity of SUHI in the urban center kept stable. The correlation between LST and forest was stronger over time with an increased proportion level. There was no correlation between LST and forest when the forest density was less than 20 ha/km2. However, when the forest density reached 80 ha/km2, the R2 of their correlation was 0.2921. The landscape configuration also affected the LST, and agglomerated water and forests showed a more substantial cooling effect. Compared with dense buildings, scattered buildings showed a weaker warming effect. These findings would be helpful for the current landscape configuration adjustment and future urban planning, with the promotion of sustainable development in Hangzhou.},

Services interfaced by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) specifications allow GIS clients to access geospatial data without knowing the details about how these data are gathered or stored. Currently, OGC is working on a set of interoperable interfaces and metadata encodings known as Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) that enables the integration of heterogeneous sensor systems and measurements into geospatial information infrastructures. In this article we present the implementation of gvSOS, a new module for gvSIG to connect to Sensor Observation Services (SOS). The gvSOS client module allows gvSIG users to interact with SOS servers, displaying the information gathered by sensors as a layer composed by features. We present the software engineering development process followed to build the module. For each step of the process we specify the main obstacles found during the development such as restrictions of the gvSIG architecture, inaccuracies in the OGC specifications, and a set of common problems found in current SOS server implementations available on the Internet. For most of the problems found we propose a solution, or at least we present a path that might lead to it. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

This paper presents Q-SOS-an extension of the OGC's Sensor Observation Service (SOS) that supports retrieval of observation data together with quality descriptions. These descriptions are represented in an observation data model covering various aspects of data quality assessment. The service and the data model have been developed based on open standards and open source tools, and are productively being used to share observation data from the TERENO observatory infrastructure. We discuss the advantages of deploying the presented solutions from data provider and consumer viewpoints. Enhancements applied to the related open-source developments are also introduced.},

A data-driven geography may be emerging in response to the wealth of georeferenced data flowing from sensors and people in the environment. Although this may seem revolutionary, in fact it may be better described as evolutionary. Some of the issues raised by data-driven geography have in fact been longstanding issues in geographic research, namely, large data volumes, dealing with populations and messy data, and tensions between idiographic versus nomothetic knowledge. The belief that spatial context matters is a major theme in geographic thought and a major motivation behind approaches such as time geography, disaggregate spatial statistics and GIScience. There is potential to use Big Data to inform both geographic knowledge-discovery and spatial modeling. However, there are challenges, such as how to formalize geographic knowledge to clean data and to ignore spurious patterns, and how to build data-driven models that are both true and understandable.},

It specifically targets the promotion of the "Environmental Observation Web" as an observation-centric paradigm for building the next generation of environmental applications. In the Environmental Observation Web, the great majority of data are considered as observations. These can be generated from sensors (hardware), numerical simulations (models), as well as by humans (human sensors). Independently from the observation provenance and application scope, data can be represented and processed in a standardised way in order to understand environmental processes and their interdependencies. The development of cross-domain applications is then leveraged by technologies such as Cloud Computing, Internet of Things, Big Data Processing and Analytics. For example, "the cloud" can satisfy the peak-performance needs of applications which may occasionally use large amounts of processing power at a fraction of the price of a dedicated server farm. The paper also addresses the need for Specific Enablers that connect mainstream Future Internet capabilities with sensor and geospatial technologies. Main categories of such Specific Enablers are described with an overall architectural approach for developing environmental applications and exemplar use cases.},

I argue that this sort of data are largely being streamed from sensors, and this represents a sea change in the kinds of data that we have about what happens where and when in cities. I describe how the growth of big data is shifting the emphasis from longer term strategic planning to short-term thinking about how cities function and can be managed, although with the possibility that over much longer periods of time, this kind of big data will become a source for information about every time horizon. By way of conclusion, I illustrate the need for new theory and analysis with respect to 6 months of smart travel card data of individual trips on Greater London's public transport systems. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

abstract = {The need for constant monitoring of environmental conditions has produced an increase in the development of wireless sensor networks (WSN). The drive towards smart cities has produced the need for smart sensors to be able to monitor what is happening in our cities. This, combined with the decrease in hardware component prices and the increase in the popularity of open hardware, has favored the deployment of sensor networks based on open hardware. The new trends in Internet Protocol (IP) communication between sensor nodes allow sensor access via the Internet, turning them into smart objects (Internet of Things and Web of Things). Currently, WSNs provide data in different formats. There is a lack of communication protocol standardization, which turns into interoperability issues when connecting different sensor networks or even when connecting different sensor nodes within the same network. This work presents a sensorized platform proposal that adheres to the principles of the Internet of Things and theWeb of Things. Wireless sensor nodes were built using open hardware solutions, and communications rely on the HTTP/IP Internet protocols. The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) SensorThings API candidate standard was used as a neutral format to avoid interoperability issues. An environmental WSN developed following the proposed architecture was built as a proof of concept. Details on how to build each node and a study regarding energy concerns are presented.},

abstract = {The appropriateness of spatial prediction methods such as Kriging, or aggregation methods such as summing observation values over an area, is currently judged by domain experts using their knowledge and expertise. In order to provide support from information systems for automatically discouraging or proposing prediction or aggregation methods for a dataset, expert knowledge needs to be formalized. This involves, in particular, knowledge about phenomena represented by data and models, as well as about underlying procedures. In this paper, we introduce a novel notion of meaningfulness of prediction and aggregation. To this end, we present a formal theory about spatio-temporal variable types, observation procedures, as well as interpolation and aggregation procedures relevant in Spatial Statistics. Meaningfulness is defined as correspondence between functions and data sets, the former representing data generation procedures such as observation and prediction. Comparison is based on semantic reference systems, which are types of potential outputs of a procedure. The theory is implemented in higher-order logic (HOL), and theorems about meaningfulness are proved in the semi-automated prover Isabelle. The type system of our theory is available as a Web Ontology Language (OWL) pattern for use in the Semantic Web. In addition, we show how to implement a data-model recommender system in the statistics tool environment R. We consider our theory groundwork to automate semantic interoperability of data and models. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

Heterogeneous resources can be aggregated and abstracted according to tailored thing-like semantics, thus enabling Things as a Service paradigm, or better a “Cloud of Things”. In the Future Internet initiatives, sensor networks will assume even more of a crucial role, especially for making smarter cities. Smarter sensors will be the peripheral elements of a complex future ICT world. However, due to differences in the “appliances” being sensed, smart sensors are very heterogeneous in terms of communication technologies, sensing features and elaboration capabilities. This article intends to contribute to the design of a pervasive infrastructure where new generation services interact with the surrounding environment, thus creating new opportunities for contextualization and geo-awareness. The architecture proposal is based on Sensor Web Enablement standard specifications and makes use of the Contiki Operating System for accomplishing the IoT.

abstract = {Many sensor networks have been deployed to monitor Earth's environment, and more will follow in the future. Environmental sensors have improved continuously by becoming smaller, cheaper, and more intelligent. Due to the large number of sensor manufacturers and differing accompanying protocols, integrating diverse sensors into observation systems is not straightforward. A coherent infrastructure is needed to treat sensors in an interoperable, platform-independent and uniform way. The concept of the Sensor Web reflects such a kind of infrastructure for sharing, finding, and accessing sensors and their data across different applications. It hides the heterogeneous sensor hardware and communication protocols from the applications built on top of it. The Sensor Web Enablement initiative of the Open Geospatial Consortium standardizes web service interfaces and data encodings which can be used as building blocks for a Sensor Web. This article illustrates and analyzes the recent developments of the new generation of the Sensor Web Enablement specification framework. Further, we relate the Sensor Web to other emerging concepts such as the Web of Things and point out challenges and resulting future work topics for research on Sensor Web Enablement. {\textcopyright} 2011 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

This GCI provides an operational graphic user interface, built upon a service-oriented architecture to allow (1) widespread sharing and seamless integration of distributed geospatial data; (2) an effective way to address the uncertainty and positional errors encountered in fusing data from diverse sources; (3) the decomposition of complex planning questions into atomic spatial analysis tasks and the generation of a web service chain to tackle such complex problems; and (4) capturing and representing provenance of geospatial data to trace its flow in the modeling task.

At that time, each GIS vendor had their own formats for publishing and/or exchanging their GIS data. There was no mechanism or organization that provided a forum for the GIS vendors and GIS data users to collaborate and agree on how to share GIS data. That requirement, along with the vision of a few individuals, led to the formation of the OGC.

abstract = {Urban performance currently depends not only on a city's endowment of hard infrastructure (physical capital), but also, and increasingly so, on the availability and quality of knowledge communication and social infrastructure (human and social capital). The latter form of capital is decisive for urban competitiveness. Against this background, the concept of the "smart city" has recently been introduced as a strategic device to encompass modern urban production factors in a common framework and, in particular, to highlight the importance of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in the last 20 years for enhancing the competitive profile of a city. The present paper aims to shed light on the often elusive definition of the concept of the "smart city." We provide a focused and operational definition of this construct and present consistent evidence on the geography of smart cities in the EU27. Our statistical and graphical analyses exploit in depth, for the first time to our knowledge, the most recent version of the Urban Audit data set in order to analyze the factors determining the performance of smart cities. We find that the presence of a creative class, the quality of and dedicated attention to the urban environment, the level of education, and the accessibility to and use of ICTs for public administration are all positively correlated with urban wealth. This result prompts the formulation of a new strategic agenda for European cities that will allow them to achieve sustainable urban development and a better urban landscape. {\textcopyright} 2011 by The Society of Urban Technology.},

These large spatiotemporal data sets have motivated a challenge for Geoinformatics: how to model changes and design good quality software. Many existing spatiotemporal data models represent how objects and fields evolve over time. However, to properly capture changes, it is also necessary to describe events. As a contribution to this research, this article presents an algebra for spatiotemporal data. Algebras give formal specifications at a high-level abstraction, independently of programming languages. This helps to develop reliable and expressive applications. Our algebra specifies three data types as generic abstractions built on real-world observations: time series, trajectory and coverage. Based on these abstractions, it defines object and event types. The proposed data types and functions can model and capture changes in a large range of applications, including location-based services, environmental monitoring, public health, and natural disasters. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

While all of them address different visions and needs, they share a common theme: How do we manage massive amounts of heterogeneous data, derive knowledge out of them instead of drowning in information, and how do we make our findings reproducible and reusable by others? In a network of knowledge, topics span across scientific disciplines and the idea of domain ontologies as common agreements seems like an illusion. In this work, we argue that these trends require a radical paradigm shift in ontology engineering away from a small number of authoritative, global ontologies developed top-down, to a high number of local ontologies that are driven by application needs and developed bottom-up out of observation data. Similarly as the early Web was replaced by a social Web in which volunteers produce data instead of purely consuming it, the next generation of knowledge infrastructures has to enable users to become knowledge engineers themselves. Surprisingly, existing ontology engineering frameworks are not well suited for this new perspective. Hence, we propose an observation-driven ontology engineering framework, show how its layers can be realized using specific methodologies, and relate the framework to existing work on geo-ontologies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

This paper presents the calibration and prediction results for both regions, reviews their data requirements, compares the differences in the initial configurations and control parameters for the model in the two settings, and discusses the role of GIS in the applications. The model has generated some long term predictions that appear useful for urban planning and are consistent with results from other models and observations of growth.

Evaluations were then performed to determine how well single measures and composites of measures could describe the map readability. The evaluation of single measures showed that the amount of information was most important, followed by the spatial distribution of information. The measures of object complexity and graphical resolution were not useful for explaining the map readability of our test data. The evaluations of composites of measures included three methods: threshold evaluation, multiple linear regression and support vector machine.

A number of different remotely-sensed global land cover products are available but studies have shown that there are large spatial discrepancies between these different products when compared. To address this issue of land cover uncertainty, a tool called Geo-Wiki was developed, which integrates online and mobile applications, high resolution satellite imagery available from Google Earth, and data collection through crowdsourcing as a mechanism for validating and improving globally relevant spatial information on land cover and land use. Through its growing network of volunteers and a number of successful data collection campaigns, almost 5 million samples of land cover and land use have been collected at many locations around the globe. This paper provides an overview of the main features of Geo-Wiki, and then using a series of examples, illustrates how the crowdsourced data collected through Geo-Wiki have been used to improve information on land cover and land use.},

abstract = {In recent years, the relationship between geographic information science (GIScience) and spatial thinking has attracted much attention in English-speaking countries. Nevertheless, vagueness remains concerning the concept of spatial thinking and its components. The aim of this paper is to review previous studies on the relationship between GIScience and spatial thinking, and to clarify the elements of spatial thinking and related terms. After discussing the basic elements of spatial thinking, it explores the relationship between GIScience and spatial thinking by dividing it into two aspects: the role of geographic information systems (GIS) in education on spatial thinking, and the role of spatial thinking in GIScience. Concerning the former, potential roles of GIS in spatial thinking education, particularly in geography and STEM disciplines, are suggested. Concerning the latter, the relationships between the body of knowledge on GIS education and the elements of spatial thinking are examined. Finally, the present situation and future prospects for studies on spatial thinking and GIScience in Japan are briefly discussed. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

In this paper, we address this promising approach to analyze the impact of collaborative Web 2.0 tools applied to PPGIS applications in urban planning actions. We develop a Web 2.0 PPGIS application through free, easy-to-use tools, which consist of a Web mapping service, with eligible geospatial data layers, where users explore and comment. A database stores the contributions in a format supported by GIS. We also set up a prototype version in Canela (Brazil), to test its usability. The results showed that it is a valuable approach for engaging the public. It could promote communication among users and decision makers in a more interactive and straightforward way. Besides, it is easy to set up and understandable by non-experts. The Web 2.0 PPGIS may serve as a social tool for any spatially-related issue involving community members in any context. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We develop a new version of prospect theory that employs cumulative rather than separable decision weights and extends the theory in several respects. This version, called cumulative prospect theory, applies to uncertain as well as to risky prospects with any number of outcomes, and it allows different weighting functions for gains and for losses. Two principles, diminishing sensitivity and loss aversion, are invoked to explain the characteristic curvature of the value function and the weighting functions. A review of the experimental evidence and the results of a new experiment confirm a distinctive fourfold pattern of risk attitudes: risk aversion for gains and risk seeking for losses of high probability; risk seeking for gains and risk aversion for losses of low probability. This article has benefited from discussions with Colin Camerer, Chew Soo-Hong, David Freedman, and David H. Krantz. We are especially grateful to Peter P.

abstract = {The Snowden revelations about National Security Agency surveillance, starting in 2013, along with the ambiguous complicity of internet companies and the international controversies that followed provide a perfect segue into contemporary conundrums of surveillance and Big Data. Attention has shifted from late C20th information technologies and networks to a C21st focus on data, currently crystallized in “Big Data.” Big Data intensifies certain surveillance trends associated with information technology and networks, and is thus implicated in fresh but fluid configurations. This is considered in three main ways: One, the capacities of Big Data (including metadata) intensify surveillance by expanding interconnected datasets and analytical tools. Existing dynamics of influence, risk-management, and control increase their speed and scope through new techniques, especially predictive analytics. Two, while Big Data appears to be about size, qualitative change in surveillance practices is also perceptible, accenting consequences. Important trends persist – the control motif, faith in technology, public-private synergies, and user-involvement – but the future-orientation increasingly severs surveillance from history and memory and the quest for pattern-discovery is used to justify unprecedented access to data. Three, the ethical turn becomes more urgent as a mode of critique. Modernity's predilection for certain definitions of privacy betrays the subjects of surveillance who, so far from conforming to the abstract, disembodied image of both computing and legal practices, are engaged and embodied users-in-relation whose activities both fuel and foreclose surveillance.},

On the one hand, Big Data hold great promises for discovering subtle population patterns and heterogeneities that are not possible with small-scale data. On the other hand, the massive sample size and high dimensionality of Big Data introduce unique computational and statistical challenges, including scalability and storage bottleneck, noise accumulation, spurious correlation, incidental endogeneity and measurement errors. These challenges are distinguished and require new computational and statistical paradigm. This paper gives overviews on the salient features of Big Data and how these features impact on paradigm change on statistical and computational methods as well as computing architectures. We also provide various new perspectives on the Big Data analysis and computation. In particular, we emphasize on the viability of the sparsest solution in high-confidence set and point out that exogenous assumptions in most statistical methods for Big Data cannot be validated due to incidental endogeneity. They can lead to wrong statistical inferences and consequently wrong scientific conclusions.},

abstract = {Privacy is a concept in disarray. Nobody can articulate what it means. As one commentator has observed, privacy suffers from "an embarrassment of meanings." Privacy is far too vague a concept to guide adjudication and lawmaking, as abstract incantations of the importance of "privacy" do not fare well when pitted against more concretely stated countervailing interests. In 1960, the famous torts scholar William Prosser attempted to make sense of the landscape of privacy law by identifying four different interests. But Prosser focused only on tort law, and the law of information privacy is significantly more vast and complex, extending to Fourth Amendment law, the constitutional right to information privacy, evidentiary privileges, dozens of federal privacy statutes, and hundreds of state statutes. Moreover, Prosser wrote over 40 years ago, and new technologies have given rise to a panoply of new privacy harms. A new taxonomy to understand privacy violations is thus sorely needed. This Article develops a taxonomy to identify privacy problems in a comprehensive and concrete manner. It endeavors to guide the law toward a more coherent understanding of privacy and to serve as a framework for the future development of the field of privacy law.},

We first sketch our vision defining seven goals which concern: developing a new understanding of urban problems; effective and feasible ways to coordinate urban technologies; models and methods for using urban data across spatial and temporal scales; developing new technologies for communication and dissemination; developing new forms of urban governance and organisation; defining critical problems relating to cities, transport, and energy; and identifying risk, uncertainty, and hazards in the smart city. To this, we add six research challenges: to relate the infrastructure of smart cities to their operational functioning and planning through management, control and optimisation; to explore the notion of the city as a laboratory for innovation; to provide portfolios of urban simulation which inform future designs; to develop technologies that ensure equity, fairness and realise a better quality of city life; to develop technologies that ensure informed participation and create shared knowledge for democratic city governance; and to ensure greater and more effective mobility and access to opportunities for urban populations.We begin by defining the state of the art, explaining the science of smart cities. We define six scenarios based on new cities badging themselves as smart, older cities regenerating themselves as smart, the development of science parks, tech cities, and technopoles focused on high technologies, the development of urban services using contemporary ICT, the use of ICT to develop new urban intelligence functions, and the development of online and mobile forms of participation. Seven project areas are then proposed: Integrated Databases for the Smart City, Sensing, Networking and the Impact of New Social Media, Modelling Network Performance, Mobility and Travel Behaviour, Modelling Urban Land Use, Transport and Economic Interactions, Modelling Urban Transactional Activities in Labour and Housing Markets, Decision Support as Urban Intelligence, Participatory Governance and Planning Structures for the Smart City. Finally we anticipate the paradigm shifts that will occur in this research and define a series of key demonstrators which we believe are important to progressing a science of smart cities.{\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.},

Yet despite numerous examples of this 'urban labelling' phenomenon, we know surprisingly little about so-called smart cities, particularly in terms of what the label ideologically reveals as well as hides. Due to its lack of definitional precision, not to mention an underlying self-congratulatory tendency, the main thrust of this article is to provide a preliminary critical polemic against some of the more rhetorical aspects of smart cities. The primary focus is on the labelling process adopted by some designated smart cities, with a view to problematizing a range of elements that supposedly characterize this new urban form, as well as question some of the underlying assumptions/ contradictions hidden within the concept. To aid this critique, the article explores to what extent labelled smart cities can be understood as a high-tech variation of the 'entrepreneurial city', as well as speculates on some general principles which would make them more progressive and inclusive.},

abstract = {We introduce the term metacity as a conceptual framework that can be shared by ecologists and designers and applied across the wide variety of urban habitats found around the world. While the term metacity was introduced by UN-HABITAT to designate hyper cities of over twenty million people, for us it is not limited to large urban agglomerations, but rather refers to the proliferation of new forms of urbanization, each with distinct ecological and social attributes. These various urban configurations when combined with new digital sensing, communication and social networking technologies constitute a virtual meta-infrastructure, present in all cities today. This new metacity has the potential to integrate new activist forms of ecological and urban design research and practice in making the transition from sanitary to sustainable city models globally. The city of Baltimore, Maryland will be used both as a site to illustrate these recent urban trends, and also as an example of the integration of ecology and urban design pursued by the two authors over the past seven years [1,2]. Metacity theory is drawn from both an architectural analysis of contemporary forms of urbanism, new forms of digital monitoring and communication technologies, as well as metapopulation and metacommunity theories in ecology. We seek to provide tools and lessons from our experiences for realizing an integrated metacity approach to achieving social sustainability and ecological resilience on an increasingly urbanized planet.},

To obtain such a commitment, I believe that operators should be able to develop and mobilize (digital) spatial skills so that they could efficiently manage their spatiality.

abstract = {The currently consumption-driven society produces an enormous volume of waste every day. Continuous depletion of natural finite resources by urban populations is leading the globe to an uncertain future. Therefore, to prevent further depletion of global resources, sustainable consumption and a strategic waste management system would be required. It is evident that a significant number of global non-renewable resources such as cadmium, mercury and tellurium will experience permanent shortfall in global supply within the next two to three decades. Astonishingly, the current recycling rate of these very scarce metals is significantly low in all cities around the globe. The concept of the zero waste city includes a 100% recycling of municipal solid waste and a 100% recovery of all resources from waste materials. However, transforming currently over-consuming cities into zero waste cities is challenging. Therefore, this study aims to understand the key factors waste management systems in cities such as consumption, resource depletion and possible decoupling opportunity through implementing the “zero waste city” concept. The study proposes five significant principles for transforming current cities into zero waste cities in the context of long-term sustainability. A simultaneous and harmonized application of sustainable behaviour and consumption, product stewardship, a 100% recycling and recovery of resources, legislated zero landfill and incineration are required to transform current city into a zero waste city.},

abstract = {Recently there has been quite a number of independent research activities that investigated the potentialities of integrating social networking concepts into Internet of Things (IoT) solutions. The resulting paradigm, named Social Internet of Things (SIoT), has the potential to support novel applications and networking services for the IoT in more effective and efficient ways. In this context, the main contributions of this paper are the following: (i) we identify appropriate policies for the establishment and the management of social relationships between objects in such a way that the resulting social network is navigable; (ii) we describe a possible architecture for the IoT that includes the functionalities required to integrate things into a social network; (iii) we analyze the characteristics of the SIoT network structure by means of simulations.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to substantially support sustainable development of future smart cities. This article identifies the main issues that may prevent IoT from playing this crucial role, such as the heterogeneity among connected objects and the unreliable nature of associated services. To solve these issues, a cognitive management framework for IoT is proposed, in which dynamically changing real-world objects are represented in a virtualized environment, and where cognition and proximity are used to select the most relevant objects for the purpose of an application in an intelligent and autonomic way. Part of the framework is instantiated in terms of building blocks and demonstrated through a smart city scenario that horizontally spans several application domains. This preliminary proof of concept reveals the high potential that self-reconfigurable IoT can achieve in the context of smart cities. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) shall be able to incorporate transparently and seamlessly a large number of different and heterogeneous end systems, while providing open access to selected subsets of data for the development of a plethora of digital services. Building a general architecture for the IoT is hence a very complex task, mainly because of the extremely large variety of devices, link layer technologies, and services that may be involved in such a system. In this paper, we focus specifically to an urban IoT system that, while still being quite a broad category, are characterized by their specific application domain. Urban IoTs, in fact, are designed to support the Smart City vision, which aims at exploiting the most advanced communication technologies to support added-value services for the administration of the city and for the citizens. This paper hence provides a comprehensive survey of the enabling technologies, protocols, and architecture for an urban IoT. Furthermore, the paper will present and discuss the technical solutions and best-practice guidelines adopted in the Padova Smart City project, a proof-of-concept deployment of an IoT island in the city of Padova, Italy, performed in collaboration with the city municipality.},

The importance of having robust, intelligent geospatial analytics systems in place to process and make sense of such data in real time cannot therefore be overestimated. The authors argue that IoT-powered smart cities stand better chances of becoming healthier cities.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is made of sensors and other components that connect our version of the world made of atoms, i.e., humans/our bodies, our devices, vehicles, roads, buildings, plants, animals, etc., with a mirror digital version made of bits. This enables cities and regions to be self-aware and dynamically reconfigurable in real- or near-real-time, based on changes that are continuously monitored and captured by sensors, similar to the way the internal biological systems of a living being operate and respond to their environment (homeostasis). Data collected by various IoT sensors and processed via appropriate analytics can also help predict the immediate future with reasonable accuracy, which enables better planned responses and mitigation actions. Cities and regions can thus become more adaptable and resilient in face of adversity. Furthermore, IoT can link atoms (humans) to other atoms (humans) (again via bits), resulting in the formation of 'smart(er) communities' that are socially connected in new ways and potentially happier. Cities, but also less urbanised regions and the countryside, could all benefit from, and harness the power of, IoT to improve the health, well-being and overall quality of life of the local populations, actively engage citizens in a smarter governance of their region, empower them to better care for one another, promote stronger social inclusion, and ensure a greener, sustainable and more enjoyable environment for all. Technology can also help reverse the 'brain drain' from the countryside and smaller towns to larger metropolises by making the former more attractive and connected, with better services akin to those found in larger cities. The article also discusses some ways of measuring and benchmarking the performance of smart cities and their impact on well-being. However, it should be emphasised that technology is not a panacea and that other factors are equally important in creating happier and healthier cities and regions.},

abstract = {The dynamic landscape of sustainable smart cities is witnessing a significant transformation due to the integration of emerging computational technologies and innovative models. These advancements are reshaping data-driven planning strategies, practices, and approaches, thereby facilitating the achievement of environmental sustainability goals. This transformative wave signals a fundamental shift — marked by the synergistic operation of artificial intelligence (AI), artificial intelligence of things (AIoT), and urban digital twin (UDT) technologies. While previous research has largely explored urban AI, urban AIoT, and UDT in isolation, a significant knowledge gap exists regarding their synergistic interplay, collaborative integration, and collective impact on data-driven environmental planning in the dynamic context of sustainable smart cities. To address this gap, this study conducts a comprehensive systematic review to uncover the intricate interactions among these interconnected technologies, models, and domains while elucidating the nuanced dynamics and untapped synergies in the complex ecosystem of sustainable smart cities. Central to this study are four guiding research questions: 1. What theoretical and practical foundations underpin the convergence of AI, AIoT, UDT, data-driven planning, and environmental sustainability in sustainable smart cities, and how can these components be synthesized into a novel comprehensive framework? 2. How does integrating AI and AIoT reshape the landscape of data-driven planning to improve the environmental performance of sustainable smart cities? 3. How can AI and AIoT augment the capabilities of UDT to enhance data-driven environmental planning processes in sustainable smart cities? 4. What challenges and barriers arise in integrating and implementing AI, AIoT, and UDT in data-driven environmental urban planning, and what strategies can be devised to surmount or mitigate them? Methodologically, this study involves a rigorous analysis and synthesis of studies published between January 2019 and December 2023, comprising an extensive body of literature totaling 185 studies. The findings of this study surpass mere interdisciplinary theoretical enrichment, offering valuable insights into the transformative potential of integrating AI, AIoT, and UDT technologies to advance sustainable urban development practices. By enhancing data-driven environmental planning processes, these integrated technologies and models offer innovative solutions to address complex environmental challenges. However, this endeavor is fraught with formidable challenges and complexities that require careful navigation and mitigation to achieve desired outcomes. This study serves as a comprehensive reference guide, spurring groundbreaking research endeavors, stimulating practical implementations, informing strategic initiatives, and shaping policy formulations in sustainable urban development. These insights have profound implications for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, providing a roadmap for fostering resiliently designed, technologically advanced, and environmentally conscious urban environments.},

Smart cities are of great interest to theoretical circles and are favored by city governments. However, in China, research on common problems and solution strategies in the process of smart city construction is still insufficient. To address this insufficiency, we utilized Python language and the Selenium library to realize a web crawler and construct a smart city corpus background library. Then, the word2vec model was used for word vectorization to divide policy texts into phrases, and 132 policies from 85 cities above the prefecture level in China were analyzed using the Gaussian mixture model (GMM). The results showed many problems in the smart city construction process in China, including the homogenization of content, the wide topic coverage, the influence of higher-level governments, the mismatch with the local situation, and the neglect of relationship governance. Moreover, an efficiency-governance model was designed, and it held certain theoretical and practical guiding significance for further promoting the healthy and sustainable development of smart city construction in China.},

abstract = {The ‘smart city' has received growing attention as a concept that could play an essential role in the sustainability of the Arctic. Today, the idea is associated with information and communication technology (ICT) when used in urban areas to improve quality of life, offer more efficient and effective use of cities' infrastructures, foster social inclusion, and mitigate environmental harm. However, the relationship between smart cities and Arctic sustainability remains ambiguous, especially from perspectives beyond those of techno-optimism. Our aim in this paper is to critically discuss the value of smart city concept for Arctic cities, from an urban dynamic perspective. To this end, this paper reflects on how the sustainability of Arctic cities can be challenged by urban dynamics in metrics for (1) smart city development, (2) politics and bureaucratization, and (3) the role of citizens. The paper has several implications for academia, practitioners, and policymakers: for the former, it advances an alternative debate to explore the complex relations between smart city development and Arctic sustainability; for practitioners and policymakers, it indicates the problematic but often hidden side of smart city development, stressing the need to carefully translate the concept and its promises to fit the unique Arctic context.},

abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to examine the relationship between institutional logics and specifications quality, and how this relationship is mediated by the legitimacy of the procurement process and stewardship behaviour. Design/methodology/approach: This study draws on insights from institutional logics theory, and legitimacy and stewardship behaviour literature. We conducted an extended literature review to gain a comprehensive understanding of “institutional logics” and their manifestations in organizational contexts, utilizing the 2000–2024 data collected from the EBSCO, Scopus and Web of Science databases, complemented with Google Scholar. We gather that institutional logics manifest in several forms, and that while some organizations may thrive on a single logic, in certain contexts institutional logics can manifest in combinations – “multiple logics or hybrids”. Based on this understanding, we developed testable research hypotheses, predicting the influences of institutional logics – professional logic, efficient service logic and delivery (market) logic, on legitimacy, stewardship behaviour and specifications quality. We then carried out an empirical study, adopting a quantitative cross-sectional survey design with a self-administered questionnaire to test the hypothesized relationships. The empirical data were obtained from 162 procuring and disposing entities in Uganda and analyzed using the partial least squares structural equation modelling technique. Findings: The study findings reveal that institutional logics exert a strong positive effect on the legitimacy of the procurement process and on stewardship behaviour, which, in turn, both positively influence specifications quality. Research limitations/implications: The study findings have implications for theory and practice. The study findings provide useful insights that support the conceptual and theoretical development of institutional logics theory and applications in procurement literature. In addition, the study findings enhance procurement managers' understanding of the mechanisms through which institutional logics can foster specifications quality. However, considering the fact that the study was conducted in a single country context, and focused on the public sector only, the findings of the study might not be generalizable globally. Originality/value: This study contributes to established knowledge about quality management and procurement by examining the legitimacy of the procurement process and stewardship behaviour of those involved in procurement processes as mechanisms through which procuring entities are able to use institutional logics to enhance specifications quality. In addition, the study highlights areas for future research that may be explored to increase understanding of the value of institutional logics in ensuring specifications quality, and the link between specifications quality and the general performance of procuring entities.},

The case exemplifies the importance of integrating technological and social perspectives. It aligns with the emerging shift to AI urbanism and enriches the discourse on innovatory urban governance.},

abstract = {This study explores the critical role of boundary objects in the context of people-centred smart cities, a new paradigm in urban development that emphasises citizen participation in planning and decision-making. Boundary objects—artefacts, documents, or concepts that facilitate communication and collaboration across different knowledge domains—are increasingly recognized as essential tools in the complex, multi-stakeholder environment of urban governance. Despite extensive research on boundary objects in organizational contexts, their specific application in smart cities remains underexplored. This study addresses this gap by investigating how BOs, particularly collaborative tools and spaces, contribute to innovation, engagement, and knowledge-sharing in people-centred smart cities. Employing a Systematic Literature Review following the PRISMA protocol, this research synthesizes key insights from scholarly articles to comprehensively understand boundary objects' role in urban governance. This study offers a theoretical framework for leveraging boundary objects to enhance the inclusivity and sustainability of smart cities. It suggests avenues for future research, including empirical validation and exploration of boundary objects in diverse geographic and cultural contexts.},

abstract = {The necessity of citizen and government participation in smart city building is highlighted by numerous smart city initiatives disregarding public concerns and government responses. Although the citizen-government relationship in smart cities has been intensively studied, citizen satisfaction with government responses has received less attention. The citizen-government dialogues, including public concerns, government responsiveness, and citizen satisfaction, play equal essential roles in smart city building. By analyzing the data from the Message Board for Leaders and developing the regression model and new research framework, this study examined public concerns, government responsiveness, and citizen satisfaction in smart cities. The results reveal that government response rate, timeliness, and quality are impacted by various public concerns. Moreover, communication satisfaction, timeliness satisfaction, and resolution satisfaction can be impacted by government response timeliness and quality. This study provides nuanced evidence of digital interactions between citizens and governments within the context of smart city development. By elucidating various factors influencing government responsiveness and citizen satisfaction, this study offers actionable insights to enhance inclusive and citizen-focused smart city initiatives.},

In this article, I make a distinction between local efforts to reshape the urban landscape, and a global smart city imaginary which those efforts draw upon and help sustain. While attention has been given to the malleability of the smart city concept at this global scale, there remains little effort to interrogate the way that the future is used to sanction specific solutions. Through a critical engagement with smart city marketing materials, industry documents, and consultancy reports, I explore how the future is recruited, rearranged, and represented as a rationalization for technological intervention in the present. This is performed amidst three recurring crises: massive demographic shifts and subsequent resource pressures, global climate change, and the conflicting demands of fiscal austerity that motivate the desire of so many cities to attract foreign direct investment and highly skilled workers. In revealing how crises are pre-empted, precautioned, and prepared for, I argue that the smart city imaginary normalizes a style and scale of response deemed appropriate under liberal capitalism.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {While scholars critique the first-generation of the corporate smart city for failing to tackle people-oriented agendas and authentically respond to the needs of residents, many point to a potential to move beyond narrow environmental and economic objectives and tackle social issues. But concrete empirical evidence of this potential is visibly lacking. In parallel, researchers have brought attention to the emergence of the so-called ‘smart city 2.0'. This is framed as a decentralised, people-centric approach where smart technologies are employed as tools to tackle social problems, address resident needs and foster collaborative participation. This contrasts to the techno-economic and centralised approach of the dominating ‘smart city 1.0' or first-generation paradigm, which is primarily focused on diffusing smart technologies for corporate and economic interests. Utilising this dichotomy as an analytical framework, this paper examines Aizuwakamatsu Smart City in Fukushima, Japan to demonstrate how a smart city can be framed and implemented as a tool for tackling endogenous social challenges. Findings unearth a myriad of novel approaches to utilising data and ICT to respond to resident needs, improve livelihoods and widely share smart city benefits. Yet they also point to a need to transcend polarised discourses around alternative models of smart cities and appreciate the messy reality of hybrid, on-the-ground smart urbanisation and the co-existence of contrasting yet complementary visions and approaches.},

This was an important milestone in a struggle between IT companies over visibility and legitimacy in the smart city market. Drawing on actor-network theory and critical planning theory, the paper analyzes IBM's smarter city campaign and finds it to be storytelling, aimed at making the company an 'obligatory passage point' in the implementation of urban technologies. Our argument unfolds in three parts. We first trace the emergence of the term 'smart city' in the public sphere. Secondly, we show that IBM's influential story about smart cities is far from novel but rather mobilizes and revisits two long-standing tropes: systems thinking and utopianism. Finally, we conclude, first by addressing two critical questions raised by this discourse: technocratic reductionism and the introduction of new moral imperatives in urban management; and second, by calling for the crafting of alternative smart city stories. {\textcopyright} 2014 {\textcopyright} 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

In this literature, universities are often discussed as an example of an institution with a particularly strong and cohesive logic, one rooted in notions of academic excellence and the pursuit of universal knowledge. However, more recent literature has argued that multiple institutional logics often compete and conflict with one another in a single organization. In this paper, we use the notion of competing logics to examine how academics in the United Kingdom understand the university as an institution. We perform a factor analysis on questionnaires completed by academics to identify overarching rationalizations of universities. Our analysis suggests three competing institutional logics characterize universities: autonomy, utilitarianism and managerialism. We show these multiple logics produce competing models of the university as an institution, and we discuss the practical and theoretical implications.},

While the smart citizen is most often seen as a kind of foil for those more stereotypically top-down, neoliberal and repressive visions of the smart city that have been widely critiqued within the literature, this paper argues for an attention to the ‘actually existing smart citizen', who plays a much messier and more ambivalent role in practice. This paper proposes the dual figures of ‘the general citizen' and ‘the absent citizen' as a heuristic for thinking about how the lines of inclusion and exclusion are drawn for citizens, both discursively and materially, in the actual making of the smart city. These figures are meant to highlight how the universal and unspecified figure of ‘the citizen' is discursively deployed to justify smart city policies, while at the same time, actual citizens remain largely excluded from such decision and policy-making processes. Using a case study of Atlanta, Georgia and its ongoing smart cities initiatives, we argue that while the participation of citizens is crucial to any truly democratic mode of urban governance, the emerging discourse around the promise of smart citizenship fails to capture the realities of how citizens are actually discussed and enrolled in the making of these policies.},

To address this gap we develop a conceptual framework from studies of recessions and examine the case study of the IBM Smarter Cities initiative against this framework. Our case builds on interview and archival data. Our study offers two contributions. First, we offer an empirical examination of city technology from the perspective of stakeholders and actors who are tasked with the role to create and disseminate these technologies instead of the perspective of cities that use the technology. Second, we propose a strategic view to city technology and showcase the distinctive theoretical and empirical insights that future studies can develop by shifting the attention on the processes and practices inside the ICT organisations creating and disseminating these city technologies.},

In the specific case of Italy, which faced political and economic distress between 2011 and 2013, “smart city” policies became one of the foundational political technologies for the implementation of austerity measures. In this paper, I analyse how the smart city provided a lexicon for urban austerity through a series of different sites and vehicles of policymaking, from practitioners to companies and other institutions. I argue that smart city discourses and practices functioned as a political technology that was effective in justifying cost containment measures and supporting the shift to pro-innovation public expenditures. Yet, at the same time, the smart city techno-utopian vocabulary created spaces where other meanings and, potentially, alternative political outcomes were made possible by diverse alignments of knowledge and expertise.},

The second path, instead, stands on the gray literature produced by the American business community and relates to a techno-centric understanding of the subject. Divided along such paths, the future development of this new and promising field of research risks being undermined. For while the bibliometric analysis indicates that smart cities are emerging as a fast-growing topic of scientific enquiry, much of the knowledge that is generated about them is singularly technological in nature.

These dichotomies generate a critical knowledge gap because they suggest divergent hypotheses on what principles need to be considered when implementing strategies for enabling smart city development.

abstract = {Smart cities are increasingly advocated by governments and the private sector as the primary means to deliver urban sustainability. Particularly in Europe and North America, the smart city is envisioned as a place where digital technologies are deployed to ‘solve' urban sustainability problems. Such visions have been broadly critiqued in the urban studies literature for reflecting techno-utopian, neoliberal approaches to urban development that exert corporate control over cities, but there has been little empirical verification of these critiques. More recently, a disparate and interdisciplinary body of literature has emerged documenting the impacts of smart city initiatives in practice. This paper provides a state-of-the-art, empirically informed analysis of smart-sustainability, which considers established critiques of smart city policy and visions alongside the increasing body of evidence concerning the actual experiences of smart city initiatives. Through a systematic review of the smart city literature pertaining to Europe and North America, we identify and test five tensions between the smart city and the goals of sustainable urban development. These tensions involve: (1) reinforcing neoliberal economic growth; (2) focusing on more affluent populations; (3) disempowering and marginalising citizens; (4) neglecting environmental protection; and, (5) failing to challenge prevailing consumerist cultures. On the basis of these findings we propose how digital technologists, urban developers, municipalities and citizens might address these tensions. A key finding is that the potential to empower and include citizens represents the key to unlocking forms of smart-sustainable urban development that emphasise environmental protection and social equity, rather than merely reinforcing neoliberal forms of urban development.},

abstract = {This article employs a social justice framing to examine youth perspectives of the smart city. We examine how youth understand the impact of digital technologies on urban transformations and whether their technology skills and digital literacy give them a sense of ownership over the future of their city. Research was conducted within the context of a six-week summer educational program involving seventy-nine youth of color from public high schools in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The program mixed digital skill building with urban fieldwork to prototype solutions to long-standing urban problems: the sort of problems that smart city policies also seek to change. Our research points to a conundrum for youth. Although they embraced technological innovations, they indicated that digital technologies failed to serve the public or address pressing concerns they identified as problematic within the city: crime, drugs, and homelessness. Instead, in their view, digital technologies delivered the most benefit to private spaces in the home and workplace. Furthermore, the youth did not envision that emergent technologies would improve their neighborhoods or communities but only their employment prospects. This research suggests that the emergent smart city is reproducing actual as well as perceived urban inequities: Wealthy residential neighborhoods and spaces of the new economy become “smart,” but much of the city remains left behind. These patterns create a paradox for youth who invest in digital skills while remaining on the margins of technology-driven, smart urban change.

abstract = {Scholars have offered important critiques of the socio-spatial processes of contemporary technological development, including the rise of “smart city” urban development models. While these critiques have been essential for understanding contemporary forms of techno-capitalism and their reach into new areas, this paper calls for a consideration of alternative modes of digital development in urban life beyond the logics of securitisation and capital accumulation. In particular, I examine the critical discourses and experimental practices of a grassroots movement focused on claiming “technological sovereignty” (TS) in Barcelona. The TS movement is a broad, de-centralised network of cooperatives, associations, and community initiatives experimenting with alternative practices of locally rooted, open-source digital development. These groups explore democratic and cooperative practices of work, property, production, and consumption in relation to digital technology, based around an ethics of care and a commitment to working through and within local communities. In examining the values, beliefs, and practices of the TS movement, I bring ongoing discussions around digitalisation and the “smart city” into critical conversation with the extensive literature on prefigurative urban politics and postcapitalist economies.},

abstract = {This article argues that the turn toward smart cities, emphasizing solutions, services, and infrastructures driven by digital technologies, has reinforced a dominant ideology shaping urban decision making, frameworks, and outcomes. Two core dimensions of this ideology of technology in urban governance interact to consequentially reshape urban processes: (1) the priority of attracting high-technology industries as engines for urban economies and (2) the tendency to reframe urban problems into technological problems, to be addressed by technological solutions. Together, these mechanisms operate in conjunction to privilege technological needs, capacities, and priorities in urban governance, contributing to the widespread exclusion of people and problems beyond the scope of technology. Although not unprecedented, this ideology of technology has acquired renewed potency with neoliberalized urbanism, urban restructuring, and the ongoing information revolution. Furthermore, these changes intensify the ongoing transformation of cities (and space more generally) into digitized spaces tailored for capital accumulation in the context of digital and surveillance capitalism. To illustrate these dynamics, we briefly describe recent events in San Francisco, one of the key sites in the current techno-economic paradigm.

What emerged from our analysis was the importance of cognitive barriers to empowerment. Employees' resistance appeared to be motivated less by intentional self-interest than by the constraints of well-established, ingrained schemas. Resistance was also fueled by skepticism among the employees about management's commitment to the new decision-making schema, especially because employees judged managerial actions to be inconsistent with their new espoused framework. A grounded model of schema change is developed for changes in organizational decision-making schemas during empowerment efforts. Theoretical implications and suggestions for improving organizational change efforts are proposed.},

After setting out in brief the emergence of smart cities and current key debates, we note a number of practical, political, and normative questions relating to citizenship, social justice, and the public good that warrant examination. The remainder of the chapter provides an initial framing for engaging with these questions. The first section details the dominant neoliberal conception and enactment of smart cities and how this works to promote the interests of capital and state power and reshape governmentality. We then detail some of the more troubling ethical issues associated with smart city technologies and initiatives. Having set out some of the more troubling aspects of how social relations are produced within smart cities, we then examine how citizens and citizenship have been conceived and operationalized in the smart city to date. We then follow this with a discussion of social justice and the smart city. In the fifth section, we explore the notion of the “right to the smart city” and how this might be used to recast the smart city in emancipatory and empowering ways. Finally, we set out how the book seeks to answer our questions and extend our initial framing, exploring the extent to which the “right to the city” should be a fundamental principle of smart city endeavors.},

abstract = {Despite its growing ubiquitous presence, the smart city continues to struggle for definitional clarity and practical import. In response, this study interrogates the smart city as global discourse network by examining a collection of key texts associated with cities worldwide. Using a list of 5,553 cities, a systematic webometric exercise was conducted to measure hit counts produced by searching for “smart city.” Consequently, 27 cities with the highest validated hit counts were selected. Next, 346 online texts were collected from among the top 20 hits across each of the selected cities, and analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively using AntConc software. The findings confirm, first, the presence of a strong globalizing narrative which emphasizes world cities as “best practice” models. Second, they reveal the smart city's association—beyond the quest for incremental, technical improvements of current urban systems and processes—with a pronounced transformative governance agenda. The article identifies five critical junctures at the heart of the evolving smart city discourse regime; these shed light on the ongoing boundary work in which the smart city is engaged and which contain significant unresolved tensions. The paper concludes with a discussion of resulting implications for research, policy, and practice.},

It does so through utilizing a futureorientated lens to sketch out the kinds of work required to reimagine, reframe, and remake smart cities. I argue that, on the one hand, there is a need to produce an alternative “future present” that shifts the anticipatory logics of smart cities to that of addressing persistent inequalities, prejudice, and discrimination and is rooted in notions of fairness, equity, ethics, and democracy. On the other hand, there is a need to disrupt the “present future” of neoliberal smart urbanism, moving beyond minimal politics to enact sustained strategic, public-led interventions designed to create more-inclusive smart city initiatives. Both tactics require producing a deeply normative vision for smart cities that is rooted in ideas of citizenship, social justice, the public good, and the right to the city that needs to be developed in conjunction with citizens.},

abstract = {Drawing on an analysis of critics' reviews of Atlanta Symphony Orchestra (ASO) performances, we investigate how broader shifts in institutional logics shape the discourse of critics and their judgment of performances. We highlight how the aesthetic logic that traditionally informs the practices of the symphony yielded, in the face of declining orchestral resources, to a more commercially oriented market logic. As institutionalists have argued, shifts in logics are often catalysed by exogenous shocks. In the ASO, this blending of aesthetic and market logics became salient in the wake of a pivotal organizational event, the 1996 musicians' strike. Qualitatively comparing pre- and post-strike reviews of ASO performances, we find that the discourse of critics shifted to capture the changing logic of the symphony: post-strike reviews were more attuned to market than aesthetic aspects of the symphony. Nonetheless, their reviews suggested that judgments based on notions of cultural authenticity were virtually unaffected. Although our results echo existing claims that art world critics often act in a ritualistic fashion, serving as gatekeepers for the authenticity of cultural genres, we extend scholarship by highlighting how critics' stories are embedded in broader discursive fields that reveal how they patrol the boundaries of genres. {\textcopyright} Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005.},

abstract = {The smart city as a “digital turn” in critical urban geography has gone largely unnoticed in postcolonial urbanism. This paper seeks to address this gap by examining the emergence of new forms of postcolonial citizenship at the intersection of digital and urban publics. In particular, I investigate the production of a “smart citizen” in India's 100 smart cities challenge – a state-run inter-urban competition that seeks to transform 100 existing cities through ICT-driven urbanism. By examining the publicly available documents and online citizen consultations as well as observations of stakeholder workshops in four of the proposed smart cities, I illustrate how a global technocratic imaginary of “smart citizenship” exists alongside its vernacular translation of a “chatur citizen” – a politically engaged citizen rooted in multiple publics and spatialities. This takes place through three key processes – enumerations, performances and breaches. Enumerations are coercions by the state of an urban population that has so far been largely hidden from analogue technologies of governance and governmentality. Articulations are the performances of smart citizenship across digital and material domains that ironically extend historic social inequalities from the urban to the digital realm. Finally, breaches are the ruptures of the impenetrable technocratic walls around the global smart city, which provides a window into alternative and possible futures of postcolonial citizenship in India. Through these three processes, I argue that subaltern citizenship in the postcolony exists not in opposition, but across urban and digital citizenships. I conclude by offering the potential of a future postcolonial citizen who opens up entangled performances of compliance and connivance, authority and insecurity, visibility and indiscernibility across political, social, urban and digital publics.},

We use this scaffold to measure smart citizen inclusion, participation, and empowerment in smart city initiatives in Dublin, Ireland. Our analysis illustrates how most ‘citizen-centric' smart city initiatives are rooted in stewardship, civic paternalism, and a neoliberal conception of citizenship that prioritizes consumption choice and individual autonomy within a framework of state and corporate defined constraints that prioritize market-led solutions to urban issues, rather than being grounded in civil, social and political rights and the common good.

abstract = {Urban planning is, in many countries, increasingly becoming intertwined with local climate ambitions, investments in urban attractiveness and “smart city” innovation measures. In the intersection between these trends, urban experimentation has developed as a process where actors are granted action space to test innovations in a collaborative setting. One arena for urban experimentation is urban testbeds. Testbeds are sites of urban development, in which experimentation constitutes an integral part of planning and developing the area. This article introduces the notion of testbed planning as a way to conceptualize planning processes in delimited sites where planning is combined with processes of urban experimentation. We define testbed planning as a multi-actor, collaborative planning process in a delimited area, with the ambition to generate and disseminate learning while simultaneously developing the site. The aim of this article is to explore processes of testbed planning with regard to the role of urban planners. Using an institutional logics perspective we conceptualize planners as navigating between a public sector-and an experimental logic. The public sector logic constitutes the formal structure of “traditional” urban planning, and the experimental logic a collaborative and testing governance structure. Using examples from three Nordic municipalities, this article explores planning roles in experiments with autonomous buses in testbeds. The analysis shows that planners negotiate these logics in three different ways, combining and merging them, separating and moving between them or acting within a conflictual process where the public sector logic dominates.},

abstract = {20 years after the appearance of literature evidence and the launch of the first, pioneering cases, the smart city domain remains ambiguous and generates an increasing argument with regard to its feasibility and potential. Indeed, today the smart city domain is being characterized by an emerging market that provides novel solutions for cyber-physical integration in the urban space; a competitive standardization arena that attempts to clarify the domain and homogenize these solutions; a growing network of city alliances, forums and market places that aim to bring together scientists, practitioners and city governments in an attempt to define a common urban future; and a promising international network of scholars that studies and evolves the domain. Nevertheless, a “common understanding” of what smart city is or could be missing and generates questions regarding whether a “smart utopia” - that is the outcome of the “wedding” of vendors and local governments - drives the above efforts and leaves out real community problems. The aim of this paper is to perform an analysis of 10 representative international city cases that claim to be smart. The analysis is based on a multi-method that combines literature evidence, official websites and reports, narrative city walks, and interviews with corresponding officials. The outcomes distinguish utopia from reality, introduce a pool of evidence that can justify whether a city can claim to be smart and depict a brief view of the future smart city.},

abstract = {The notion of a circular economy is often presented in discourses on a more sustainable future. A circular economy proposes more efficient material flows in growth-based economy and in support of sustainable development. Repair is presented as one of the phases in a circular economy and supports product lifetime extension. The paper brings a particular form of repair, community repair, into discourses on a circular economy. Data from a world-wide initiative in community repair and from participant observation in a Repair Caf{\'{e}} provide new insights in the possible roles and challenges of repair in a circular economy. Notions of efficiency and economic growth are contested in community repair; repair contributes to product lifetime extension and product attachment through acts of tinkering, sharing, and care. The analysis points to an inseparability of the material and social in community repair, contributing to a non-reductionist understanding of a circular economy. Community repair is a sociomaterial entanglement of people and things. This enables a different perspective on the role of repair, from merely a phase in the material flows in a circular economy to a sustainable way of living with things in a circular economy.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the relation between digitalisation and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Digitalisation is often presented as a transformative power, changing the way we live and work. The SDGs describe digitalisation technologies such as ICTs as enablers of sustainable development. The unsustainability of these technologies themselves may actually undermine the gains made in digitalisation. This becomes clear when we locate the discussion of digitalisation and the SDGs in a discussion of the Planetary Boundaries framework. The example of one of the most emblematic digital technologies of our time, the smartphone, shows the negative impact of its production and consumption on the biosphere, the basis for all life on our planet, and on many of the social aspects of the SDGs, such as poverty, child labour, decent work, and peace. But rather than promoting sustainable digitalisation, this paper proposes the notion of sustainment as a foundational principle for the sustainability of digitalisation. While sustainability has become a mean to an end, sustainment is about sustaining life itself. With sustainment, digitalisation and its design can strengthen our ability to respond to the challenges of living on a finite planet.},

abstract = {Drawing on the thought of Max Weber, in particular his theory of stratification, this book engages with the question of whether the digital divide simply extends traditional forms of inequality, or whether it also includes new forms of social exclusion, or perhaps manifests counter-trends that alleviate traditional inequalities whilst constituting new modalities of inequality. With attention to the manner in which social stratification in the digital age is reproduced and transformed online, the author develops an account of stratification as it exists in the digital sphere, advancing the position that, just as in the social sphere, inequalities in the online world go beyond the economic elements of inequality. As such, study of the digital divide should focus not simply on class dynamics or economic matters, but cultural aspects-such as status or prestige-and political aspects-such as group affiliations. Demonstrating the enduring relevance of Weber's distinctions with regard to social inequality, The Third Digital Divide: A Weberian approach to rethinking digital inequalities explores the ways in which online activities and digital skills vary according to crucial sociological dimensions, explaining these in concrete terms in relation to the dynamics of social class, social status and power. As such, it will be of interest to social scientists with interests in sociological theory, the sociology of science and technology, and inequality and the digital divide.},

abstract = {The concept of digital literacy has been defined in numerous ways over the last two decades to incorporate rapid technological changes, its versatility, and to bridge the global digital divide. Most approaches have been technology-centric with an inherent assumption of cultural and political neutrality of new media technologies. There are multiple hurdles in every stage of digital literacy implementation. The lack of solutions such as local language digital interfaces, locally relevant content, digital literacy training, the use of icons and audio excludes a large fraction of illiterate people. In this article, we analyse case studies targeted at under-connected people in sub-Saharan Africa and India that use digital literacy programmes to build knowledge and health literacy, solve societal problems and foster development. In India, we focus on notable initiatives undertaken in the domain of digital literacy for rural populations. In Sub-Saharan Africa, we draw from an original project in Kenya aiming at developing digital literacy for youth from low-income backgrounds. We further focus on Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso and Tanzania, where field studies have been conducted on the use of digital technologies by low-literacy people and on how audio and icon-based interfaces and Internet lite standard could help them overcome their limitations. The main objective of this article is to identify key performance indicators (KPIs) in the context of digital literacy skills as one of the pillars for digital inclusion. We will learn how digital literacy programmes can be used to build digital literacy and how KPIs for sustainable development can be established. In the final discussion, we offer lessons learned from the case studies and further recommendation for stakeholders and decision-makers in the field of digital health literacy.},

abstract = {Algorithms in online platforms interact with users' identities in different ways. However, little is known about how users understand the interplay between identity and algorithmic processes on these platforms, and if and how such understandings shape their behavior on these platforms in return. Through semi-structured interviews with 15 US-based TikTok users, we detail users' algorithmic folk theories of the For You Page algorithm in relation to two inter-connected identity types: person and social identity. Participants identified potential harms that can accompany algorithms' tailoring content to their person identities. Further, they believed the algorithm actively suppresses content related to marginalized social identities based on race and ethnicity, body size and physical appearance, ability status, class status, LGBTQ identity, and political and social justice group affiliation. We propose a new algorithmic folk theory of social feeds-The Identity Strainer Theory-to describe when users believe an algorithm filters out and suppresses certain social identities. In developing this theory, we introduce the concept of algorithmic privilege as held by users positioned to benefit from algorithms on the basis of their identities. We further propose the concept of algorithmic representational harm to refer to the harm users experience when they lack algorithmic privilege and are subjected to algorithmic symbolic annihilation. Additionally, we describe how participants changed their behaviors to shape their algorithmic identities to align with how they understood themselves, as well as to resist the suppression of marginalized social identities and lack of algorithmic privilege via individual actions, collective actions, and altering their performances. We theorize our findings to detail the ways the platform's algorithm and its users co-produce knowledge of identity on the platform. We argue the relationship between users' algorithmic folk theories and identity are consequential for social media platforms, as it impacts users' experiences, behaviors, sense of belonging, and perceived ability to be seen, heard, and feel valued by others as mediated through algorithmic systems.},

Recent work suggests that discovering a filtering algorithm's existence in a curated feed influences user experience, but it remains unclear how users reason about the operation of these algorithms. In this qualitative laboratory study, researchers interviewed a diverse, non-probability sample of 40 Facebook users before, during, and after being presented alternative displays of Facebook's News Feed curation algorithm's output. Interviews revealed 10 "folk theories" of automated curation, some quite unexpected. Users who were given a probe into the algorithm's operation via an interface that incorporated "seams," visible hints disclosing aspects of automation operations, could quickly develop theories. Users made plans that depended on their theories. We conclude that foregrounding these automated processes may increase interface design complexity, but it may also add usability benefits.},

This emerging human attribute is known as digital literacy. Today, digital literacy is an essential component of everyone's personal and professional lives to survive and thrive in the digital world. The notion of advocating digital literacy around the world is leveraged on the shoulders of higher education institutes. The institutes are playing a pivotal role in mentoring the younger generation to be digitally literate so that they can contribute effectively towards an individual, societal and national development and progression. This same now applies to the South Pacific region as well, with its recent progressive growth of ICT and the dynamic use of digital technology. It can also be added that digital literacy and, by extension, digital fluency is more needed in developing countries, including the South Pacific region, as these countries rely heavily on ICTs for their economic survival, competition and progression. However, there is a dearth of baseline research on digital literacy in the South Pacific since the concept is still new and an emerging one in the region. A few works have been done on the components of digital literacy highlighted in this integrative literature review paper. The anecdotal research will elaborate on the concept of digital literacy, discuss its importance and impacts with major emphasis on the South Pacific, and provide a comprehensive review of digital literacy, its importance and its impact on higher education in the South Pacific.},

abstract = {In the e-permeated society, a society also increasingly unpredictable and uncertain, “digital literacy” becomes not only a key factor in enabling participation in education, as well as employment and other aspects of social life, but also a means of gaining some understanding of the world. The DigEuLit project, funded by the EC eLearning Initiative, has a task of defining digital literacy and developing a framework and tools for digital literacy development in European educational settings. We have observed converging literacies which have gained new relevance in digital environments, and proposed a definition of digital literacy which focuses on the processes of using digital tools to support the achievement of goals in the individual's life-situation. A suite of online tools is being developed to enable digital literacy progress to be tracked by teachers and learners, and evolution of these tools will continue beyond the life of the project.},

abstract = {Most people from rural and township areas in South Africa do not have skills in utilizing information and communication technology (ICT), particularly those who are not in education, employment or training (NEET). Addressing the gap of ICT skills is one of the fundamental options to grow and develop the capacity of people to effectively participate in economic activities. The general objective of this qualitative study was to explore how digital literacy skills can advance the lives of people currently searching for employment. Data were obtained using semi-structured interviews with participants who were not employed and with diverse school backgrounds. The results indicate a need to strengthen existing digital literacy programmes for NEET people. Most of the interviewed NEET people experienced challenges when seeking work on digital platforms, because they are not skilled in digital literacy. Analysis of the data from interview transcripts revealed that there is an array of challenges which prevent NEET people from efficiently using ICTs when searching for work opportunities. These include the high cost of Internet connections and the lack of knowledge of how to use these digital platforms. The study concludes that digital literacy is one of the skills which remains critical for work seekers to increase their chances of achieving continuous work opportunities, and eventually obtain employment or become employers themselves. It is hoped that this study will contribute to the continuous discussions about the lack of digital literacy skills among young people who are economically inactive.},

The study focuses on integration of computer skills and digital literacy training into school curriculum in an environment of low internet and technology access in schools in the Machakos region of Kenya. The initiative began with the development and implementation of digital literacy curriculum and evolved into a research project that investigates educators' perspectives on digital literacy and information and communication technology (ICT) integration in schools. The researchers collected data from surveys and interviews given to educators at three public schools in the Machakos region of Kenya in summer 2023. Analysis of the data suggests there is a disconnect between the educators' perspectives on the importance of ICT and digital literacy and the lack of resources available to implement ICT and digital literacy training. Based on this analysis, the researchers plan to expand and diversify their data pool, adapt the digital literacy curriculum in collaboration with Kenya educators, and determine methods of collecting data that may reveal the long-term effects of digital literacy training on students. The researchers will take these measures to further the program's ultimate goal of positively impacting students and their communities by increasing digital literacy.},

The literature of information poverty is reviewed tracking its origins in library and information science and the various approaches that have been taken to tackling information poverty, including international development programmes such as the Global Libraries Initiative, working response to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, the importance of access to health information and so on. The paper sets out themes that emerged in a roundtable discussion of library and information science academics in 2017. Discussion centred on: definitions of information poverty which reflect the wide variety of ways in which it is possible to be information poor; literacy and information literacy; the ways in which information can reduce poverty and disadvantage; library and information science initiatives to tackle information poverty; and information poverty in the context of social justice. The group agreed that there was a major piece of work to be done in reframing the library and information science discipline in terms of information poverty. Four key dimensions of information poverty for collaborative future research are: (1) information as an agent to eradicate poverty; (2) the causal factors resulting in information poverty; (3) creation and production activities to combat information poverty; and (4) better understanding of areas of extreme disadvantage and aspects of information need. A list of the key causal factors in creating information poverty which came out of the discussion is presented. Further research initiatives are underway for setting up a partnership/consortium that would lay the foundations for a multidisciplinary network on information poverty, sharing expertise internationally.},

The government has implemented the Digital Literacy Programme, distributing tablets to schools across the country, and also a new curriculum, promoting innovative teaching that includes digital literacy, learner-centered teaching, and relevance to students' lives. Our purpose in this research was to explore culturally sustaining teaching methods in line with the Kenyan government's push for innovative teaching and digital literacy attainment for all students. We used case study methods to describe Kenyan teachers' perceptions of innovative teaching and digital literacy while participating in the Inquiry Initiative, a three-day professional development series. Participants included preschool, primary, and secondary teachers from Trans Nzoia County. Data sources were pre- and post-surveys, participant-generated artifacts, and interviews. Our participants perceived the following needs: new literacies for learners, creativity for learners, collaboration and group work, and creativity to overcome technological challenges. Overall, participants embraced learner-centered teaching theoretically but found that the lack of technological resources created barriers to teaching digital literacy in a learner-centered fashion. We found that teachers reported mostly using technology for teaching preparation and record keeping rather than engaging students in digital literacy practices. To solve technological challenges, teachers described having students work in groups and using smartphones. Future research could share more creative solutions to technical challenges in low-income countries.},

abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a rapid shift to remote consultations. The study aimed to explore the prevalence of telehealth consultations amongst allied health professional (AHP) services in the UK National Health Service (NHS), and the potential impact on health inequities and burden of treatment for patients. Methods: Cross-sectional online survey. Participants were practising UK registered AHP and/or AHP service manager in an NHS/social care/local authority service. Data was collected between May – June 2021. Results: 658 participants took part in this study, including 119 AHP service managers, managing a total of 168 AHP services, and 539 clinicians. 87.4% of clinicians and 89.4% of services represented were using telehealth consultations as a method of delivering healthcare, the majority reported their services were planning to continue using telehealth post COVID-19 restrictions. Participants reported a lack of technological skills for patients as the most prevalent barrier affecting the patient's ability to conduct a telehealth consultation, followed by a lack of technology for patients. These were also reported as the biggest disadvantages of telehealth for patients. The majority of clinicians reported a reduction in the cost of parking/transport to attend hospital appointments as a patient benefit of telehealth consultations. Reported benefits for clinicians included saving travel time/costs and allowing flexible working, while benefits to the AHP service included patient flexibility in how their appointments are conducted and reducing the potential exposure of staff to communicable diseases. Conclusions: The current large-scale implementation of telehealth in NHS AHP services may increase disparities in health care access for vulnerable populations with limited digital literacy or access. Consequently, there is a danger that telehealth will be considered inappropriate and thus, underutilised, negating the potential benefits of sustainability, patient empowerment and the reduction in the burden of treatment.},

abstract = {Digital systems are significantly associated with inequality in the global South. That association has traditionally been understood in terms of the digital divide or related terminologies whose core conceptualization is the exclusion of some groups from the benefits of digital systems. However, with the growing breadth and depth of digital engagement in the global South, an exclusion worldview is no longer sufficient. What is also needed is an understanding of how inequalities are created for some groups that are included in digital systems. This paper creates such an understanding, drawing from ideas in the development studies literature on chronic poverty to inductively build a model of a new concept: ‘adverse digital incorporation', meaning inclusion in a digital system that enables a more-advantaged group to extract disproportionate value from the work or resources of another, less-advantaged group. This new model will enable those involved with digital development to understand why, how and for whom inequality can emerge from the growing use of digital systems in the global South. It creates a systematic framework incorporating the processes, the drivers, and the causes of adverse digital incorporation that will provide detailed new insights. The paper concludes with implications for both digital development researchers and practitioners that derive from the model and its exposure to the broader components of power that shape the inclusionary connection between digital and inequality.},

Second, it highlights the expectation gaps on expected changes that digital inclusion efforts would bring. Results show deep, layered gaps by access, skills, and expectations for digital inclusion programs within disadvantaged communities.

abstract = {This paper provides a comprehensive overview of digital inclusion initiatives aimed at mitigating the connectivity gap in Africa and the United States. As the world becomes increasingly reliant on digital technologies, the importance of ensuring equitable access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) has become a global priority. This review explores the current state of digital inclusion efforts in two distinct regions, Africa and the USA, to understand the challenges, successes, and lessons learned in bridging the digital divide. The first section of the review focuses on Africa, where disparities in digital access are particularly pronounced. Examining various initiatives, policies, and strategies implemented by governments, non-governmental organizations, and international partners, the review delves into the multifaceted approaches taken to extend connectivity to underserved populations. It highlights the role of innovative solutions such as community networks, mobile technologies, and public-private partnerships in fostering digital inclusion across diverse socioeconomic landscapes. In the second section, the review turns its attention to the United States, where digital inclusion efforts also face challenges despite higher overall connectivity rates. By analyzing federal and local initiatives, as well as private sector contributions, the review explores the nuances of digital inclusion in an advanced technological landscape. The examination encompasses efforts to address urban-rural disparities, promote digital literacy, and ensure affordable broadband access for marginalized communities. Comparative analysis between the two regions identifies commonalities and differences in the approaches to digital inclusion. The review assesses the impact of cultural, economic, and political factors on the effectiveness of initiatives, emphasizing the need for context-specific strategies. Furthermore, it evaluates the role of regulatory frameworks and policy interventions in shaping the trajectory of digital inclusion initiatives. Drawing from the experiences of both continents, this review contributes insights to inform future digital inclusion policies and practices globally. By synthesizing the lessons learned from Africa and the USA, policymakers, researchers, and practitioners can develop more nuanced and contextually relevant strategies to bridge the connectivity gap, fostering a more inclusive and equitable digital future for all.},

abstract = {Compared to digital infrastructure or governance frameworks, digital skills and literacy are often overlooked in geopolitical discussions. Yet, they will have a huge influence on economies and societies. Governments across the world are trying to develop a whole-of-society approach to digital literacy and skills to accelerate their inclusive digital transformation, ensure sustainable and inclusive economic growth and equip their citizens with the competencies needed to respond to future challenges. China, the US and the EU each take different approaches to digital skills and literacy at home and pair them with different global engagement strategies. This paper explores the way forward for digital skills in Africa, drawing on the examples of Rwanda, Senegal and South Africa. Africa's demand for investment in digital skills and literacy is particularly high because of its rapid demographic growth and wide digital divide. But, as the continent plays catch-up with major digital powers, it is vulnerable to harms such as online disinformation, cybercrime, data breaches and digital surveillance driven by commercial and state interests. Despite the growing threats that digital technologies present for individuals and societies, African governments have mainly focused on hard skills, while less effort and resources have been invested in soft skills (eg. media literacy, ability to navigate government e-services, social skills to behave online, et cetera), which are key to navigate the internet safely and responsibly.

abstract = {With the global evolution of information and communication technology (ICT), organisations need to keep up-to-date with the trends. Whilst most countries are able to respond to these technological changes by drawing on the resources available to them, organisations tend to find it more difficult to keep up. This paper thus attempts to analyse critically the influencing factors regarding e-government implementation and the roles of the key stakeholders in driving successful implementation within public sector organisations in developing countries. Based on the extant literature review and empirical studies, the researchers have developed a conceptual framework stemming from a unification of the concepts, factors, theories and models for e-government implementation. Qualitative analysis was adopted using a multiple case study strategy, and focusing on the three-tiers of government – Federal, Government Agency and Local levels. This conceptual framework has re-affirmed the external and internal influencing factors and the key stakeholder' and their roles. The e-government stakeholders include the government (ministry/agency), technologically-advanced country, companies and users (employers/citizens). Authors further discussed that the stakeholders' roles and tasks vary from ‘pre-implementation' (initiation) to ‘during implementation' (planning and implementation), and ‘post-implementation' (monitoring and evaluation) phases. From the analysis and findings, authors have recommended that public organisations would need to strategise their relationships with stakeholders in order to achieve a collective interest for successful e-government implementation. This study contributes to the body of knowledge in information systems by broadening the theoretical foundations of e-government field especially within the stakeholders' perspective.},

abstract = {While it has often been suggested that information and communication technologies (ICTs) provide an important means of increasing citizen participation (which is at the core of democratic government), few commentators have expected non-democracies to create online environments in which citizens can take an active part in political processes. In recent years, however, some non-democracies have begun to outperform countries with long-standing democratic traditions in terms of e-participation development. According to the 2010 United Nations (UN) e-government survey, Bahrain outranks France, Kazakhstan beats Sweden and Malaysia ranks higher than Germany. This article sets out to understand the recent rise of e-participation initiatives in non-democracies. Drawing on comparative longitudinal data from the UN e-government surveys, we tested the assertion that international drivers of change are competing with the dominant focus on domestic factors, especially in the non-democratic world, and are influencing the patterns of reform. The empirical analysis demonstrated important differences between the drivers of change in democratic and non-democratic countries and found economic globalization to be the strongest predictor of e-participation initiatives in non-democratic countries. In conclusion, we argue that economic globalization alters the context of e-participation and necessitates a re-examination of many of its premises and tenets. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Mauritius, a country that represents one of the leading advocates of e-Governance in Sub-Saharan Africa, has taken significant action to improve e-readiness dimensions and as such ranks high in terms of e-readiness index with respect to other Sub-Saharan African countries, based on the United Nations Global e-Government Readiness index. A close look at the usage rate of e-Government services such as online application, however, reveals that it is very low while online transaction is still rhetoric. This paper therefore assesses whether the high e-readiness index gives a true indication of the citizens' e-readiness using available secondary data sources. It further explores the factors facilitating and inhibiting citizens' e-readiness through the administration of a survey questionnaire. The main findings reveal that the barriers inhibiting citizens' e-readiness are resistance to change, absence of opportunities for e-participation and e-consultation, and lack of awareness. The main facilitators of citizens' e-readiness emanating from the analysis are awareness campaigns which tease out the advantages of online public services compared to traditional methods of service delivery, building of trust in government, and managing change. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {This article addresses the different institutional and cultural contexts which must be considered when implementing E-Government in sub-Saharan Africa. Although E-Government is a global phenomenon, simply transferring ICT solutions and related organizational concepts from developed to developing countries seems inappropriate. E-Government undoubtedly has the potential to reduce administrative and development problems. However, it is obvious that compared to developed countries, additional effort is necessary when implementing E-Government in developing countries. More than in developed countries, the different initial institutional, cultural, and wider administrative contexts must be considered to avoid unintended effects. It is oversimplifying the issue to merely state that E-Government projects fail in Africa and other developing regions. Although E-Government in African countries lags far behind developed countries, this should be considered more as a state failure or lack of capacity in general. In particular, the different administrative contexts and rationalities must be taken into an account when implementing E-Government projects and strategies. Therefore, especially for African countries, a context-oriented approach seems to be a more promising route to the successful implementation of E-Government. The results of this approach may not seem ambitious from a western perspective, but could contribute to the solution of real-life and development problems in African societies. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc.

However, despite high levels of investment, a broad range of applications, and various methods of access relatively low levels of various methods of access, relatively low levels of usage (and even familiarity with e-gov) are still common. For example, in Canada, long recognized as a leader in implementing e-gov, less than 27% of Canadians used E-Gov during the past 12 months and 81% of c non-users report a low level of familiarity with either federal or provincial governmental services available through e-gov (Canada, 2004). Or, consider the showcase e-gov Gyandoot project in the Dhar district in central India, whose population is estimated at 1.7 million. Even after implementing e-gov in a showcase project for the rural poor, a study by the Center for Electronic Governance, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad concluded that this model of "government to citizen" service delivery has serious sustenance problems (World Bank, 2004).

This research focuses on the critical success factors of e-government adoption, using the Republic of Cyprus as a case study. These findings show that the financial position of a nation and its e-readiness level, as well as the infrastructure facilities and technological innovations for effective knowledge management and communication, political and legal frameworks, are key factors that influence the level of e-government adoption. Furthermore, organizational and institutional aspects, as well as the socio-cultural characteristics, should not be underestimated, as these factors are crucial barriers to e-government adoption.

This paper aims to explore the factors influencing the extent to which farmers perceive the use of such services as burdensome, and to develop a framework to categorize these factors for the farming sector. To do this, we extracted a conceptual framework designed for commercial businesses and adapted it to the farming sector. We employed a qualitative case study in Switzerland and conducted face-to-face interviews with six farmers using contrast sampling. The interviews were examined by applying thematic analysis. We found influencing factors from four different fields: (1) farm and farmer characteristics (e.g., farm structure, farmer's attitude toward ICT, farmer's ICT competence, use of external support, work organization, and infrastructure), (2) usage characteristics of e-government services (e.g. quantity and frequency of data entry, and period in use), (3) perceived characteristics of e-government (e.g., network, documentation, software design, complexity, farm compatibility, and duplication), and (4) perceived farm impact (data-security). We further found that the use of e-government services has no organizational benefits for family farms. Our findings provide a conceptual framework for understanding why e-government services for farmers might contribute to either a decrease or increase in their perceived administrative burden. It further provides policy-relevant information about the factors that play a role in digital direct payment administration to reduce farmers' administrative burdens.},

From a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), this paper affirms such allusions by scholars and reports that government deployment of electronic and internet tools indeed promotes SPP towards the bigger agenda of sustainable development (SDG 12.7). In this paper, 68 articles of heterogeneous research methods published in peer-review journals since 2001–2017 are systematically reviewed. This paper concludes that efforts in building a robust ICT infrastructure, online portals, and human capacity to use ICT offer developing countries inter alia an informative platform for sharing and communicating SPP requirements. E-government also facilitates a wider sample for market readiness assessment and an integrated e-procurement system towards effective SPP monitoring and evaluation.

abstract = {The notion of corruption has emerged as a prominent topic against the backdrop of e-government. However, there are diverse but disorganized viewpoints about the relationship between e-government and corruption, thus creating difficulties in obtaining a structured overview of the existing literature and identifying the avenues to take this research area forward. Despite this, prior studies have made limited attempts to gather these fragmented observations to guide future research holistically. To address this concern, we conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) of 63 articles discussing e-government and corruption and provide a comprehensive synthesis of the current knowledge in this domain. In particular, we offer a thematic classification of prior studies, uncover the key gaps in the literature, identify the potential research areas, and provide recommendations to broaden the avenues for future studies. Furthermore, we propose an integrated conceptual framework to caution policymakers about the incomplete understanding offered by the existing studies and to inspire further research in several ways.},

abstract = {Advocated mostly by technology companies, the smart city concept promises participation, democratization and innovative urbanism. Tracking these promises and ideas, this paper explores “smart urbanism” in ten cities from all over Israel. Based on interviews with leading figures in municipalities, smart city consultants and key figures in technological companies (n = 40), the aims of this paper are to assess the efforts of cities to become smart by responding to the following questions: 1. What is guiding the decision-making process in developing technological initiatives? 2. Does context play a role in implementing technological initiatives? 3. How are the residents perceived, and what tools are being used to address residents' digital differences? The key argument of this paper is threefold: first, in the process of becoming a smart city, the roles of public and private actors are blurred, influencing the process of decision making. Second, despite contextual differences, cities adopt similar digital initiatives. Third, technological initiatives that focus on social needs and address inequality in the digital age are still at the margins. The final discussion suggests that most municipalities are still at an early stage of digitization implementation and have the ability to shape and form a vision for the cities as socio-technological ecosystems in a way that will serve their publics as a whole. The paper ends with a call for shifting the focus from the city to society in developing digital initiatives and cultivating smart social urbanism.},

abstract = {Governments across the world are experimenting with smart city technologies but recent studies suggest that not all citizens support this development. However, a comprehensive understanding of citizen discontent with the smart city is missing. This study systematically reviews academic research addressing citizen discontent with the smart city. Based on a set of 58 articles, two perspectives on citizens' discontent are identified. One perspective focuses on active discontent: citizens are dissatisfied with the technology, democratic process, and societal impact of the smart city and show different types of behavior to express their discontentment. The other perspective emphasizes passive discontent: citizen discontent does not manifest itself due to citizens' lack of awareness and skills and the absence of channels to express their discontentment. Both perspectives on discontent suggest different government responses respectively to overcome citizen discontent through ‘the right technologies', ‘the right rules', and ‘the right information', or to stimulate critical citizenship through ‘the right to smart city education and empowerment' and the ‘right to participate and challenge'. Based on our findings, a fine-grained understanding of attitudes and behavior, and government actions to address citizen discontent is developed.},

abstract = {Here we sketch the rudiments of what constitutes a smart city which we define as a city in which ICT is merged with traditional infrastructures, coordinated and integrated using new digital technologies. We first sketch our vision defining seven goals which concern: developing a new understanding of urban problems; effective and feasible ways to coordinate urban technologies; models and methods for using urban data across spatial and temporal scales; developing new technologies for communication and dissemination; developing new forms of urban governance and organisation; defining critical problems relating to cities, transport, and energy; and identifying risk, uncertainty, and hazards in the smart city. To this, we add six research challenges: to relate the infrastructure of smart cities to their operational functioning and planning through management, control and optimisation; to explore the notion of the city as a laboratory for innovation; to provide portfolios of urban simulation which inform future designs; to develop technologies that ensure equity, fairness and realise a better quality of city life; to develop technologies that ensure informed participation and create shared knowledge for democratic city governance; and to ensure greater and more effective mobility and access to opportunities for urban populations.We begin by defining the state of the art, explaining the science of smart cities. We define six scenarios based on new cities badging themselves as smart, older cities regenerating themselves as smart, the development of science parks, tech cities, and technopoles focused on high technologies, the development of urban services using contemporary ICT, the use of ICT to develop new urban intelligence functions, and the development of online and mobile forms of participation. Seven project areas are then proposed: Integrated Databases for the Smart City, Sensing, Networking and the Impact of New Social Media, Modelling Network Performance, Mobility and Travel Behaviour, Modelling Urban Land Use, Transport and Economic Interactions, Modelling Urban Transactional Activities in Labour and Housing Markets, Decision Support as Urban Intelligence, Participatory Governance and Planning Structures for the Smart City. Finally we anticipate the paradigm shifts that will occur in this research and define a series of key demonstrators which we believe are important to progressing a science of smart cities.{\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.},

abstract = {Smart cities, the current movement to advance beneficial programs and applications for urban areas, depend heavily on innovative information technologies, the expansion of data types, and increases in data volumes. This chapter explains that spatially enabled systems are critical to the success of smart cities because their unique integrating, analyzing and visualizing capabilities can multiply the power of conventional IT systems. The chapter identifies the characteristics that distinguish spatial systems and discusses how increasing amounts of interoperable, spatially enabled data is becoming available due to new sensor technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT) and social media. The chapter identifies the standards, architecture and organization structure that can create an effective spatial information environment. It points towards the use of spatial technologies in advanced artificial intelligence applications. There is an examination of the measurable benefits made possible by spatial systems including enhanced revenues, life-saving methods, and increased productivity. The chapter concludes by re-emphasizing the importance of spatial systems for smart cities initiatives.},

@article{Cammer2009a,
abstract = {This paper puts forward explanations and backgrounds to the remarkable difference in user uptake of the m-banking service M-PESA in Tanzania compared to the same service in Kenya. Data gathered from user and industry interviews, conducted during a field study in Tanzania between March-May 2009 is together with literature from Kenya used to compare the m-banking environment in the two countries. M-PESA is provided by mobile network operators (MNOs), Safaricom in Kenya and Vodacom in Tanzania. Both are the leading MNO in their respective country although Vodacom has a substantially lower market share and turnover compared to Safaricom. This simple fact resonates in many areas affecting M-PESA, such as: size of marketing budget, M-PESA's priority within the organization and the company's ability to quickly sign up agents and attract initial customers. Differences in the general economic situation, the geography and political history are also put forward. Kenya has a stronger economy, a higher GDP and a more developed banking system. This has contributed to the financial literacy in the country which is an important factor when communicating a service like M-PESA. Among the differences between the two implementations, we suggest that the three most influential factors to the user uptake have been the two companies ability to transform their airtime distribution into an agent network, the marketing strategy which needed to be adopted to the specific settings in each country, and the geographical and demographic conditions.},

abstract = {There is a well documented association between poverty and tuberculosis. Not only are the poor more likely to get TB disease, but they are also more likely to face barriers in accessing care. In addition, the economic burden of TB (loss of wages, out-of-pocket expenses for seeking care and loss of productive years of life) makes the poor people even poorer. The vision of the TB and Poverty Subgroup of the Stop TB Partnership is: "A world where the poor and most vulnerable are protected from TB and have easy and equitable access to quality care". As an initiative of the Stop TB Partnership, TB REACH is focussed on the poor and vulnerable. In addition to focussing on countries with per capita GNI of $2000, or less, TB REACH also welcomes applications that target poverty pockets within countries that have a per capita GNI between $2000 and $3000 and poverty pockets within the remaining high TB burden countries. TB REACH recognizes that due to socioeconomic disparities there are often well known sub-national population that live under substantially higher levels of poverty in these countries. These poverty pockets are vulnerable to TB and often face limited access to TB care. What is poverty? Poverty is the lack of basic human needs, such as clean water, nutrition, health care, education, clothing and shelter, because of the inability to afford them. In 1998 a UN Statement on poverty, signed by the heads of all UN agencies stated: "Fundamentally, poverty is a denial of choices and opportunities, a violation of human dignity. It means lack of basic capacity to participate effectively in society. It means not having enough to feed and cloth a family, not having a school or clinic to go to, not having the land on which to grow one's food or a job to earn one's living, not having access to credit. It means insecurity, powerlessness and exclusion of individuals, households and communities. It means susceptibility to violence, and it often implies living on marginal or fragile environments, without access to clean water or sanitation".},

abstract = {Throughout history and prehistory trade and economic growth have always entailed serious population health challenges. The post-war orthodoxies of demographic and epidemiological transition theory and the Washington consensus have each encouraged the view that industrialization necessarily changes all this and that modern forms of rapid economic growth will reliably deliver enhanced population health. A more careful review of the historical demographic and anthropometric evidence demonstrates that this is empirically false, and a fallacious oversimplification. All documented developed nations endured the 'four Ds' of disruption, deprivation, disease and death during their historic industrializations. The well-documented British historical case is reviewed in detail to examine the principal factors involved. This shows that political and ideological divisions and conflict-and their subsequent resolution in favour of the health interests of the working-class majorities-were key factors in determining whether industrialization exerted a positive or negative net effect on population health.},
