## Recommendations and Next Steps

1. **Merge the datasets**: Consider creating a unified dataset combining unique records from both sources.
2. **Investigate mismatches**: Some records appear in one file but not the other. This could be due to:
   - Different extraction patterns capturing different entries
   - Variations in how record fields were parsed
   - Differences in handling special characters or formatting

3. **Improve extraction logic**: Based on the mismatches, enhance the extraction algorithms to better handle:
   - Multiple entry types (article, book, inproceedings, etc.)
   - Complex formatting in titles and abstracts
   - Special characters and LaTeX formatting

4. **Data quality improvement**: Create a merged dataset with the highest quality data from both sources.
