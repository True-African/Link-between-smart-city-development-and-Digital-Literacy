abstract = {This paper aims to emphasize the need for enhancing inclusivity and accessibility within smart-city societies. It represents the first attempt to apply Amartya Sen's capability approach by exploring the implications of digital divides for promoting inclusive and climate-friendly cities that prioritize well-being, equity, and societal participation. Sen's framework recognizes individual variations in converting resources into valuable ‘functionings', and herein emphasizes the importance of aligning personal, social, and environmental conversion factors for individuals to fully navigate, participate in, and enjoy the benefits provided by smart cities. Adopting the capability approach and employing a cross-disciplinary analysis of the scientific literature, the primary objective is to broaden understanding of how to improve inclusivity and accessibility within smart-city societies, with a specific focus on marginalized community members facing first- and second-level digital divides. This paper underscores the importance of adopting a systemic perspective on climate-smart city navigation and stresses the importance of establishing a unified governing body responsible for monitoring, evaluating, and enhancing smart-city functionality. The paper concludes by summarizing some policy recommendations to boost social inclusion and address climate change in smart cities, such as creating capability-enhancing institutions, safeguarding redundancy in public-choice options, empowering citizens, and leveraging academic knowledge in smart-city policy formulation.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {In many developing countries, smart city initiatives are in their infancy. Like many other developing countries, smart projects in Morocco have been facing several challenges since their launch in 2016. The adoption of smart services requires the commitment and involvement of Moroccan citizens. This chapter focuses on a systematic literature review of the main studies dealing with factors that appear to improve end-user acceptance of services provided by Moroccan smart cities. A specific method known as PRISMA is being adopted to select and synthesize relevant studies in this field. The results obtained from the systematic review indicate that the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) is the most utilized theory in the literature. Additionally, the examination of existing studies has revealed that successful implementation of smart projects requires decision-makers to consider the following factors: performance expectancy, ease of use, social influence, perceived cost, awareness, trust in technology, and trust in the government.},

abstract = {In recent years, research in the smart city sector has experienced exponential growth, establishing itself as a fundamental and multifaceted field of study. Education is one of the sectors of interest in smart cities. Concurrently, the extensive academic literature on smart cities makes identifying the main areas of interest related to education, leading institutions and authors, potential interconnections between different disciplines, and existing gaps more complicated. This article maps the knowledge domain of education in smart cities through a bibliometric analysis to identify current trends, research networks, and topics of greatest interest. A total of 88 articles, published between 2000 and 2023, were examined using an interdisciplinary approach. The leading countries are mainly located in Europe and North America and include China. Bibliometrics provides an intellectual configuration of knowledge on education in smart cities; a co-word analysis identifies conceptual sub-domains in specific themes. In general, education within smart cities represents a universal challenge that requires a structured and interdisciplinary approach at all levels. Finally, this paper offers some suggestions for future research, adopting a more comprehensive view of the areas of investigation through a holistic analysis of stakeholders.},

abstract = {The profound digitalization of everyday environments and the deep social, political, and economic implications of this development mean there is an urgent need for not just advancing but rethinking digital citizenship, as well as reconsidering different actors' roles within this new order. In many societies, digital literacy already determines individuals' possibilities to effectively function as a part of society: everyday life actions such as accessing health services and using public transport are dependent on digital literacy. However, this is just one level of the ongoing transformation. More broadly, digital technology is deeply woven into everyday practices, social interactions, cultural experiences, economic transactions, and political decision-making (Manovich 2013; Williamson 2014). This results in that digital literacy, understood mainly as a set of adequate skills that help in navigating digitalized everyday environments, needs to be accompanied by notions of broader critical awareness of technologies' role in society. In this chapter, we explore one facet of this critical awareness: how the notion of digital citizenship could be complemented and expanded to include an ability to imagine alternative future trajectories .},

From societal causes to the impact of everyday actions, The Digital Disconnect explores the relationship between digital and social inequalities, and the lived consequences of digitisation. Ellen Helsper goes beyond questions of digital divides and who is connected. She asks why and how social and digital inequalities are linked and shows the tangible outcomes of socio-digital inequalities in everyday lives. The book: Introduces the key theories and concepts needed to understand both ‘traditional' and digital inequalities research. Investigates a range of socio-digital inequalities, from digital access and skills, to civic participation, social engagement, and everyday content creation and consumption. Brings research to life with a range of qualitative vignettes, drawing out the personal experiences that lay at the heart of global socio-digital inequalities. The Digital Disconnect is an expert exploration of contemporary theory, research and practice in socio-digital inequalities. It is also an urgent and impassioned call to broaden horizons, expand theoretical and methodological toolkits, and work collectively to help achieve a fairer digital future for all. Ellen J.

The smart city innovations need to encompass diverse social groups' engagements to claim their legitimacy and sustainability from a long-term perspective. In this light, this study examines the potential digital divide in the advanced technologies used in the emerging 5G smart city era. Using survey data, we investigate if the smart citizens' social and technical readiness in terms of the use experience and necessity of new technologies can predict the adoption and use of the emerging 5G smart city innovations. The empirical results from this study can inform the digital divide between the general public and technology-disadvantaged groups. The findings can also guide policymakers in prioritizing technologies that are accessible and beneficial to all potential residents of smart cities in the future. Finally, the results yield specific policy implications for practitioners who design more inclusive and sustainable smart cities in the 5G era.},

Preventive innovations usually require an action at one point in time in order to avoid an unwanted future condition. Hence, preventive innovations diffuse rather slowly, in part due to delayed rewards from adoption. Here we suggest five strategies, based on diffusion theory, for speeding up the diffusion of preventive innovations. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {In recent years, cities are expected to develop in line with the smart city (S.C.) idea. Cities, perceived as attractive places for people to live,must now meet many conditions. A city's duty is, among others, to meet the needs and expectations of both, its residents and newcomers, offering a wide range of opportunities for entrepreneurs, caring for the natural environment, constantly taking on new challenges, and meeting them for its further development. Thus, the management of a city involves undertaking activities in line with the smart city idea. However, to implement them, they use widely available means, defined as intelligent solutions, e.g., modern ICT technologies. In line with the smart city idea, a city is a center inhabited by people who create a civic and participatory society, having the ability to use the latest ICT solutions and having access to a range of services and solutions offered by the city. Since the smart city idea is considered at many levels, it is still unknown what dimensions or areas related to this concept are the most valuable and stimulating for its implementation. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to study what dimensions or areas related to this idea are the most valuable and stimulating for its implementation. The applied methodology is based on a critical analysis of the available literature in the form of bibliometric and citation analysis and analysis of the keyword characteristics of S.C. co-occurrences. The result of the research is a set of keywords that enable identifying the key dimensions and main areas of the implementation of S.C.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

By using Chile as a case study, a country that has strongly promoted mobile connections to address internet access gaps, we compared mobile-only and computer users in different dimensions of the digital inclusion process, including digital skills and differentiated uses of the web. By relying on a face-to-face national representative survey, the results showed that smartphones represent an opportunity to access the internet for those who traditionally lag behind. However mobile-only use does not necessarily lead to a more complete digital inclusion process because it was related to lower levels of skills and less diverse types of uses of the web compared to those people who also use the computer. Also, skills partially mediated the association between access device and types of uses of the web, which suggests that the differences by access device partly occur because people have greater chances to develop skills when accessing the web through computers.},

In this regard, the objective of this work was to identify which factors influence the acceptance of IT in public safety in the context of smart city. For this purpose, the qualitative approach was used, through semi-structured interviews with representatives of the Military Police and the Civil Police in Pato Branco-PR, in order to investigate thoroughly the constructs of the UTAUT model, proposed by Venkatesh et al. (2003). The main system cited by the authorities was the monitoring by cameras, called Safe Look Program. The results show that in the performance expectation, the monitoring system has quality images, which help in the people's identification. Concerning the effort expectation, the ideal would be the integration with the particular systems. Regarding the social influence, both police use social networks, by directing the sector, to publicize the work and make investigations. In relation to the facilitating conditions, there are difficulties with the functionalities of the monitoring software. With regard to smart cities, there are indications that the services are still in the process of being adjusted and they can be optimized. Furthermore, the participation of the citizen and the municipal administration is important in order to implement more services.},

Thus, the problem is not the existence of technology solutions for smart cities concepts, but how to develop services that will involve citizens to share information about the events in the city. Social psychology theories point out that sense of bellowing, perceived enjoyment, perceived reciprocal benefits, power of knowledge, outcome expectation and perceived status, provides an involvement for citizens to share information and knowledge. In this paper, we propose to relate those theories, with the intension to use a mobile augmented reality service. We created an online survey, based in a scenario with a video, where the participants visualize a character behavior sharing and getting information in the city, using a mobile augmented reality service. The results confirm that the participants accept and want to use a mobile augmented reality service in a smart city, and have been identify the factors that could be more associated with the intention to use the augmented reality technology in the smart city, namely perceived enjoyment, intention to share experience, intention to get knowledge, perceived value, perceived similarity and perceived reciprocal benefits. Exploring those constructs inside gamification solutions in this mobile augmented reality service, is discussed in the conclusion.},

abstract = {Growing urbanisation has lead to the concept of smart cities. The idea of smart city is realised with the help of internet of things (IoT) devices. The existing cloud services lack the potential to meet the peculiar requirements of IoT devices. IoT devices generate a huge amount of data and demand quick response time. Fog computing can be used to process the IoT tasks since fog nodes are comparatively closer to the IoT devices. The fog node selection for prospective IoT tasks is a multiple-criteria decision-making problem due to the diversity in the IoT requirements and the presence of a number of heterogeneous fog nodes in the smart city. However, there is no study that focused on the fog node selection mechanism keeping in view the user preferences, user requirements (URs), and optimised resource usage. This study presents the best fit-power weighted difference (BF-PWD) method for fog node selection that is used to rank and subsequently select the fog nodes for task offloading from IoT devices. The simulation results show that the proposed technique BF-PWD not only improves the success rate but also reduces the communication latency and the UR violations compared to the existing protocols.},

abstract = {The term 'smart cities' is a widely used, but at the same time a highly fuzzy concept. The fuzziness hinders our understanding on the benefits of its adoption, and explains the existence of many relevant activities with fragmented or distorted views of what a truly smart city is. The aim of this paper is to undertake a comprehensive review of how smart cities are perceived in the literature and in the light of the findings propose a clearer definition. Overview of the key terms, concepts and definitions associated to smart cities, reported in this paper, demonstrates that the definitions found in the academic literature have limited scope, and are overly focused on strategic drivers and specific actions, instead of making explicitly the connection between the concept of smart cities and the creation of environments that promote happiness and wellbeing of their residents-which should be the main function of a city. Following the thorough review on the smart cities literature, the paper proposes a comprehensive, human-centred, and context-free definition for smart cities. This definition brings an endogenous view on smart cities in which the central element is the direct participation of local actors and stakeholders in the process of thinking, defining, planning, and executing social, technological and urban transformations in cities.},

abstract = {Electronic retribution (e-retribution) is an innovation of Surakarta city government for better, easier, faster and transparent government service quality. This study aims to determine the acceptance of traditional market traders by analyzing their acceptance attitude using Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The knowledge on the traditional market sellers' acceptance on an electronic system will help government in designing smart city concept. This study uses primary data from all stalls in Depok market. This study uses Pearson correlation as data analysis. Result indicates that Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) and Perceived Usefulness (PU) have a positive effect on Actual Technology Use (AU), and Behavioral Intention (BI) has a negative effect on Actual Use (AU). This result shows that the system easiness and usefulness are critical in terms of Electronic Government (e-Government) system acceptance for traditional market sellers. The practical implication of this study is that the government needs to provide a helpdesk in the traditional market to help sellers in using the e-Retribution as part of the e-Government system.},

abstract = {Purpose: Smart city services (SCS) in contrast with other technology-based services, demand significant interaction and collaboration between the users and the service providers. This study examines the SCS delivery-channel characteristics and the users' personal (behavioral and demographic) characteristics that influence their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the services, as well as their intention to adopt (i.e. continue using) the SCS-delivery channels. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative study using a structured questionnaire was conducted for this paper. The data-collection method was administered by emailing the survey to a list of 2,350 city/urban residents who are members of the two largest universities in the greater Dubai metropolis. A total of 600 completed responses (26 percent) were received back, while 580 useable responses (25 percent) were analyzed for this paper. Findings: Our initial findings suggest that contrary to popular belief, it is not only SCS channel factors that influence user satisfaction and continuance intention. SCS users' personal characteristics (such as their user innovativeness and control-seeking behavior) are also pivotal in determining their satisfaction and intention to continue or not continue using the SCS-delivery channels. Research limitations/implications: The paper argues that both SCS channel factors and SCS users' personal characteristics jointly influence the users' experience of the services and therefore jointly determine their satisfaction with the service as well as their SCS usage continuance intention. The result of our research gives important insights into users' behaviors toward the emerging SCS channels in general, and it will be of great value to architects and designers of Smart City technologies around the world. Practical implications: The paper argues that both SCS channel factors and SCS users' personal (behavioral and demographic) characteristics jointly influence the users' trials of the services, and therefore jointly determine their satisfaction with the service as well as their SCS usage continuance intention. The result of our research gives important insights into users' behavioral intentions toward the emerging SCS channels in general; and it will be of great value to architects and designers of Smart City technologies around the world. Originality/value: This paper is one of the first few studies focused on investigating the antecedents of SCS usage behaviors in the Middle Eastern region.},

Cellular communication technology, communication networks, are developing rapidly and provide opportunities to play a role in the development of government areas. The emergence of smart city mobile applications can play a role in solving the challenges of shortening time, cutting distances, and disclosure of information. A technology acceptance survey has been carried out combined with cultural moderators. The survey data in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, is processed using Smart PLS 3.2 with Sequential Equation Modeling. It is unique to be discussed because the p-values of Uncertainty Avoidance (UC) 0,013 which means this is most significant, but Individual/Collectivism (IC) is more than 0.05, which means IC is not significant, it does not moderate the behavior of users of this technology. In this paper, we describe the findings of IC research that do not moderate behavioral intentions. One of our findings is that users use this application due to government service needs, so aspects of individualism and collectivism have no significant effect.

This paper modified the technology acceptance model to find out factors influencing customers' intention to use AV such as perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, social influence, and facilitating condition, and the moderating effects of demographic variables (gender, age, family size, income, education level, and marital status) on the relationship between predictors and intention to use AV. Online questionnaires were distributed to 318 participants in South Korea and the data was analyzed through multiple regression and integration moderation test. The findings show that social influence, facilitating conditions, and perceived usefulness are three important variables of AV usage intention. In addition, demographic variables (age, marital status, family size, and educational level) can moderate effect of PU and SI on intention to use AV. Strategic directions are suggested to managers to increase the possibility of customers' acceptance of AV.},

This trend is of interest, as cities can only be smart if they are responsive to their citizens. In this paper, the intention to use such a mobile application among adult residents (n = 420) of a mid-sized city in the southeastern United States was examined using hierarchical linear regression analysis. The regression model that was tested indicated significant predictors of the intention to use the app in order to report municipal problems, such as power outages, and to request services for one's home or community, including: Performance expectancy (e.g., citizens' beliefs that the app would be efficient, helpful, convenient), effort expectancy (citizens' beliefs about difficulty of using the app), social influence, perceived cost (e.g., privacy loss, storage space, unwanted notifications), and prior use of city apps. Consistent with current research on technology adoption, performance expectancy had the strongest influence on app-use intentions. Additionally, citizens' trust in their city government's ability to effectively manage an app was a weak, positive predictor of app-use intentions; general trust in the city government did not predict app-use intentions. Implications for city governments and city app developers are discussed.},

Although the relevance of new technologies as strategic levers for crisis resolution has been widely debated before the pandemic, especially in the smart cities' context, how individuals have agreed to include the technological changes dictated by the pandemic in their daily interactions remains an open question. This paper aims at detecting citizens' sentiment toward technology before and after the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic using Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis (FFCA) to analyze a large corpus of tweets. Specifically, citizens' attitudes in five cities (Berlin, Dublin, London, Milan, and Madrid) were explored to extract and classify the key topics related to the degree of confidence, familiarity and approval of new technologies. The results shed light on the complex technology acceptance process and help managers identify the potential negative effects of smart technologies. In this way, the study enhances scholars' and practitioners' understanding of the strategies for enabling the use of technology within smart cities to manage the transformations introduced by the health emergency and guide citizens' behaviour.},

This study explores the acceptance of use of mobile phone data (MPD) in different areas, and how it is related to different types of trust. Based on a representative survey of citizens in the two smart cities, Oslo and Tallinn, four similar trust cultures are located. The acceptance of use of MPD differed significantly between the trust cultures and, as expected, was significantly stronger in groups with higher levels of trust, either generally or in terms of reliance on technologies. The acceptance of use of MPD for commercial product development was low for all groups. Findings suggest that future users of MPD need to be aware of the significant scepticism toward and rejection of the use of such data in large parts of the population. Unless visions of the smart city are grounded in the needs and wants of citizens, such plans are not likely to succeed, and negative understandings and images of a panoptic state may take stronger hold. As for now, however, there seems to be insufficient social trust to exploit this on a wider scale without creating even more scepticism and distrust.},

Accordingly, many IoT-based smart concepts appeared in our daily lives such as smart home, smart healthcare and smart city. There are several factors accelerating or hindering the adoption of such new services and concepts. So, the acceptance of IoT-based smart services is critical and should be analyzed carefully. In this study, we aimed to prepare a proper starting point for future studies on end user acceptance of smart city services and IoT technologies by presenting a comprehensive systematic review of literature. We got 34 articles focusing on the adoption of IoT-based services with a model-based approach among initially resulted 237 papers. Our findings indicate that the adoption of smart services is getting more and more popular in recent years, especially in Asian countries. We also see that most reviewed studies prefer to develop integrated adoption models and deploy the factors of technology acceptance model (TAM). Additionally, our review results show that the researchers studying on this field generally use demographics in adoption models, mostly as control variables. This paper presents valuable findings lightening up the way of researchers who want to develop an adoption model for IoT-based smart services.},

abstract = {The rapid development of the digital age can change almost every aspect of modern life. With the advancement of technology, all can be done more easily. This creates a concept called "Smart City" where all the things that people do everyday in the city become integrated and sustainable by technology. Currently in Indonesia all business sectors have entered an era where digital platform plays an important role in it, PT Railink is one of them, PT Railink as a new provider of airport rail services issued online ticketing service based on smartphones, which of course aims to facilitate consumers to be more convenient to book the airport train tickets, but currently Railink application may not be widely accepted by the users of this service. This study focuses on measuring the acceptability of technology in Railink applications by using TAM and TRA modifications based on the SEM methodology. This research was conducted in Jakarta with two study materials, which are X and Y generations society. The result of research shows high positive impression felt about the usefulness and easiness for both generations. Analysis of technology adoption lifecycle and technology roadmaping shows that Railink application has been adopted by early majority and late majority. This indicates that the Railink app is in the ascent and mature stages, so it's important for application developers to continue promoting in order to attract more X generation to use Railink application, and for Y generation, developers should keep updating features, and make a loyalty points for the Y generation to continue using the Railink application for the next 5-10 years.},

abstract = {This work presents a study for assessing the technology acceptance of a contact tracing app, also proposed by us, which is a hybrid crowdsensing application (opportunistic and participatory). The goal of the app is that users are notified if they were in contact with others infected. It also allows creating a heat map identifying streets, squares, and commercial locations to which contaminated users were, allowing more assertive hygiene actions and eliminating infectious disease outbreaks. Our methodology aimed on finding whether people would be willing to share their location, as well as their health issues related to COVID-19. It is composed by a survey for verifying the interest of the proposed application; the prototype of the application; and the use of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). We can see that the vast majority of respondents to the first survey were interested in using a contact tracking application, even though they need to share their location and report when they become infected. In addition, the proposed RISCOVID application proved to be accepted for use by participants in the second survey.},

abstract = {Local urban identity, culture and knowledge ecosystems continue to shape innovative capacity and technological acceptance despite global exchange in talent, trade and technology. This has important implications for the development and implementation of future smart cities. The last two decades of smart city research has presented smart cities as a generic, universal aspiration without taking into consideration such local cultural differences. Future smart cities have several tasks ahead of them. The first is selecting culturally appropriate technologies from the vast array of global technologies now on offer. The second task is adapting such technology and the third task is in managing the acceptance of such technology. The above process is not linear but must be iterative, with technology acceptance considered simultaneously alongside the selection and adoption of such technologies. This study integrates the substantial literature on Technology Acceptance Modelling into the smart city discourse to begin to address this need. It also further develops our understanding of technology acceptance using the Structural Equation Modelling Method. A new synthetic model is proposed consisting of twelve factors, which have been selected based on a targeted literature review. A survey-based method was used to develop and cross-validate the model sampling a diverse population from various Iranian cities. The result of the above process is a new model named the Urban Services Technology Acceptance Model (USTAM). The validated model includes key factors related to technology such as Self-Efficacy, Operation, Work Facilitation, Relative Advantage and Compatibility. The USTAM is a useful tool for the prediction of technology acceptance in the implementation of smart cities. The final model is significant for various reasons. Firstly, it is significant for ensuring that selected technology is appropriate to local cultural contexts. Secondly it is significant to ensure that integration of technologies at metropolitan scales is managed effectively. The final significant reason is that it is well-suited to helping developing economies participate in the smart city boom in a resource efficient manner. The proposed model can potentially help cities achieve this by guiding them in the selection of appropriate technologies. The proposed model is developed with specific reference to Iran and Bangladesh. The authors suggest that the model is useful for cities of different cultural identities and characteristics, who wish to initiate their own distinctive smart city strategies.},

abstract = {We discuss the user study of a mobile cultural heritage game designed to stimulate reflection about a city's history. Aided by location-aware technology, the game fosters the serendipitous discovery of points of interest, historical images and stories, whilst players wander the city. This exploration differs from the typical precalculated path recommendations used by other location-based applications. It triggers reflection about the city's past that is as unique as its visitors. Ours is one of the first studies to attempt an understanding of the effects of serendipitous urban discovery and historic reflection-triggering technologies on user experience. We combined field trials with controlled experiments, analysing perceptions of the experience and value using responses expressed in open-ended questionnaire items. Using thematic coding and sentiment analysis, we observed types of emotional responses, indicating four potential profiles of their likelihood towards future technology adoption. Enthusiastic and Interested users appreciated the freedom of movement choice that created an autonomous experience that fostered a sense of personal accomplishment. The interface interactions of the game, designed to stimulate reflection, supported a feeling of connectedness to others. In contrast, Cynical and Sceptical users were less tolerant of perceived technological issues, requiring more perfection in functionality and design. These users are less likely to be the early adopters of serendipitous location-based apps. The game was developed as part of a large cultural informatics project but, unlike typical evaluations, we conducted this study midway through the project and not at its end. This approach (1) gave the team the possibility to take stock, pause, and reflect and (2) provided insight on future design improvements for increasing the perceived value of serendipitous urban discovery applications. Our results contribute towards a grounded understanding of user experience and help progress the development of cultural heritage applications that incorporate elements of reflection and/or place-based exploration into their functionalities.},

The Government of Mauritius has set up the Smart City Scheme to provide an enabling framework and a package of attractive fiscal and non-fiscal incentives to investors for the development of smart cities across the island. However, prior to the design and implementation of such technologies, it is important to predict the behavioural intention to use such technology so that smart city technologies effectively empower citizens and improve the quality of life of citizens. In this research work, it is proposed to use the TAM to effectively assess the perception and readiness and the perceived usefulness of certain smart city technologies such as for transportation as well as identifying key smart city applications for Mauritius. The aim of this research project is to evaluate and assess the different factors and condition that can have an impact on the perceived ease of use (PEOU), perceived usefulness (PU), behavioural intention (BI) to use and actual use (AU) of smart city technologies. For smart cities to become a reality in Mauritius, smart city applications and services should be citizen-centred and relevant for ordinary citizens in their everyday life.

abstract = {A smart city aims to become a citizen-centered city where citizens actively engage in urban operation and share urban data within a high-tech ICT infrastructure. It premises ‘smart citizens' who can understand and utilize digital technology to adapt well to the various infrastructure of smart cities. In reality, however, not only tech-savvy citizens but those who are not likely to coexist in a smart city. Disadvantaged groups with relatively insufficient awareness and the necessity of technologies might be excluded from smart cities' various benefits. The smart city innovations need to encompass diverse social groups' engagements to claim their legitimacy and sustainability from a long-term perspective. In this light, this study examines the potential digital divide in the advanced technologies used in the emerging 5G smart city era. Using survey data, we investigate if the smart citizens' social and technical readiness in terms of the use experience and necessity of new technologies can predict the adoption and use of the emerging 5G smart city innovations. The empirical results from this study can inform the digital divide between the general public and technology-disadvantaged groups. The findings can also guide policymakers in prioritizing technologies that are accessible and beneficial to all potential residents of smart cities in the future. Finally, the results yield specific policy implications for practitioners who design more inclusive and sustainable smart cities in the 5G era.},

abstract = {A respectable amount of work dealing with Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) clearly indicates a popularity of TAM in the field of technology acceptance in general. Nevertheless, there is still a gap in existing knowledge regarding representative academic literature that underlie research on TAM in educational context. The main objective of this systematic literature review is to provide an overview of the current state of research efforts on TAM application in the field of learning and teaching for a variety of learning domains, learning technologies and types of users. Through systematic search by the use of EBSCO Discovery Service, the review has identified 71 relevant studies ranged between 2003 and 2018. The main findings indicate that TAM and its many different versions represent a credible model for facilitating assessment of diverse learning technologies. TAM's core variables, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, have been proven to be antecedent factors affecting acceptance of learning with technology. The paper identifies some gaps in current work and suggests areas for further investigation. The results of this systematic review provide a better understanding of TAM acceptance studies in educational context and create a firm foundation for advancing knowledge in the field. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Technology acceptance research in teaching and learning context has become an attractive trend. A number of reviews and meta-analysis focused on specific topics related to technology acceptance in education have been conducted. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is the key model in understanding predictors of human behaviour towards potential acceptance or rejection of the technology. What this paper adds The state of current research on Technology Acceptance Model application in educational context lacks comprehensive reviews addressing variety of learning domains, learning technologies and types of users. The paper presents systematic review of relevant academic literature on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) in the field of learning and teaching. The paper provides empirical evidence on the predictive validity of the models based on TAM presented in selected literature. The findings revealed that TAM, along with its many different versions called TAM++, is a leading scientific paradigm and credible model for facilitating assessment of diverse technological deployments in educational context. TAM's core variables, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, have been proven to be antecedent factors that have affected acceptance of learning with technology. Implications for practice and/or policy The systematic review adds to the body of knowledge and creates a firm foundation for advancing knowledge in the field. By following the most common research objectives and/or by filling current gaps in applied research methods, chosen sample groups and types of result analysis, an own study could be conducted. Future research may well focus on identifying additional external factors that could further explain acceptance and usage of various learning technologies.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify the factors influencing the citizens of India to prevent cybercrimes in the proposed Smart Cities of India. Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual model has been developed for identifying factors preventing cybercrimes. The conceptual model was validated empirically with a sample size of 315 participants from India. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling with SPSS and AMOS softwares. Findings: The study reveals that the “awareness of cybercrimes” significantly influences the actual usage of technology to prevent cybercrimes in Smart Cities of India. The study reveals that government initiative (GI) and legal awareness are less influential in spreading of the awareness of cybercrimes (AOC) to the citizens of the proposed smart cities. Research limitations/implications: The conceptual model utilizes two constructs from the technology adoption model, namely, perceived usefulness and ease of use. The study employs other factors such as social media, word of mouth, GIs, legal awareness and organizations constituting entities spreading awareness from different related literature works. Thereby, a comprehensive theoretical conceptual model has been proposed which helps to identify the factors that may help in preventing cybercrimes. Practical implications: This study provides an insight to the policy maker to understand several factors influencing the AOC of the citizens of the proposed Smart Cities of India for the prevention of cybercrimes. Originality/value: There are few existing studies analyzing the effect of AOC to mitigate cybercrimes. Thus, this study offers a novel contribution.},

abstract = {Measuring and benchmarking the maturity of public service organizations is a challenging and time-consuming job as they differ in scope, size, and complexity. Existing growth models often use instruments that are generic, have no measures and do not relate the stages to the actual realisation of the systems architecture. Furthermore, these approaches take a one size fits all approach instead of a customized approach. Although the type of information to be measured can vary among different organizations, these approaches use similar instruments (e.g. stage models) and indicators (e.g. stages). Therefore, in this paper we propose a multi-level framework in which measures can be selected based on the domain and case specific needs and characteristics. Specifically, our framework focuses on measuring enterprise architecture, by looking at the blueprint for ICT infrastructure, information systems, organizational as well as technical aspects, horizontal and vertical integration and interoperability, and rules, regulations, laws, and legislations etc. Enterprise architecture provides basic understanding about the different elements of a public organization in a systematic manner. Therefore, this paper subsequently investigates the use of enterprise architecture and stages-of-growth models for measuring public organizations by means of an explorative case study of Dutch tax department using a multi-level architectural framework. The case study shows that the organizational information that can be retrieved from enterprise architecture is useful to measure and benchmark public organizations, which is hardly possible using state-of-growth models. The proposed multi-level framework is capable of measuring and benchmarking the information at the different levels by allowing public organizations to use multiple assessment approaches (e.g. stage models) and connecting them to enterprise architecture.

abstract = {This study represents two critical steps forward in the area of smart city research and practice. The first is in the form of the development of a comprehensive conceptualization of smart city as a resource for researchers and government practitioners; the second is in the form of the creation of a bridge between smart cities research and practice expertise. City governments increasingly need innovative arrangements to solve a variety of technical, physical, and social problems. "Smart city" could be used to represent efforts that in many ways describe a vision of a city, but there is little clarity about this new concept. This paper proposes a comprehensive conceptualization of smart city, including its main components and several specific elements. Academic literature is used to create a robust framework, while a review of practical tools is used to identify specific elements or aspects not treated in the academic studies, but essential to create an integrative and comprehensive conceptualization of smart city. The paper also provides policy implications and suggests areas for future research in this topic.},

Despite the strong financial and institutional supports from the central government, the performances of smart city initiatives significantly vary across pilot sites. Considering smart city initiatives as government innovation and drawing on the government innovation diffusion theories, an explanatory model has been developed to examine their variance and test it with a cross-sectional dataset using multiple regression methods. It was found that although environmental pollution was a key driver for the development of smart city in China, such environmental pollution like air pollution in particular had a curvilinear relationship (bell-shaped) with smart city development. In addition, smart cities initiatives in China were driven not only by technical rationalities but also political rationalities. Political supports from local ruling party sectaries made a difference.},

To date, the extant tourism literature on meetings, incentives, conventions, and exhibitions (MICE) tourism primarily focuses on value co-creation in the tourism industry, overlooking its integration into the urban environment for (i) city (and smart city) projects and (ii) its nexus with social aspects such as crime, which influences and shapes the urban environment. Considering 30 Italian cities over 13 years, this study employs a spatial-panel data approach to disentangle these relationships. The estimated results demonstrate that while urban mobility practices are highly responsive to MICE tourism, they are influenced by imbalances from increased users and visitors, which in turn affects urban security. This dynamic reduces the positive effect of MICE tourism on urban mobility, creating imbalances that public managers and policymakers must address. Practical implications are suggested to harness the potential of MICE tourism in current smart city projects.},

There are both positive and negative consequences of urban sprawl, but the latter are far more numerous, so solutions are needed. Therefore, four questions have been formulated for this paper: 1. What are the negative consequences of urban sprawl? 2. Are there positive aspects to the phenomenon? 3. Do the negative consequences outweigh the positive ones? 4. What should be done to mitigate the negative consequences of urban sprawl? This study aims to identify a set of actions that can reduce the identified negative consequences of urban sprawl. We believe that the key at the planning level is to implement the concept of the smart blue-green city, which respects social needs. The elements of the proposed solution have been selected with a view to reducing the phenomenon of urban sprawl, i.e. keeping people in the city, rather than designing the urban and suburban structure.</p>},

We review relevant theories of hybrid combinations of physical and virtual space, how software (code) automatically produces space, and how the politics of code (particularly map generating code) shape the representation of places. The paper concludes with a case study of the DigiPlace created by GoogleMaps that utilizes the same code which powers Google's index of cyberspace. A central argument advanced by the case study concerns how the interactions between culture, code, information, and place construct DigiPlace and shade perceptions of the places that are mapped. {\textcopyright} 2007 a Pion publication printed in Great Britain.},

The many positive attributes of networks are often featured - the capacity to solve problems, govern shared resources, create learning opportunities, and address shared goals - and a literature focused on the challenges networks pose for managers seeking to realize these network attributes is developing. The authors share an interest in understanding the potential of networks to govern complex public, or "wicked," problems. A fundamental challenge to effectively managing any public problem in a networked setting is the transfer, receipt and integration of knowledge across participants. When knowledge is viewed pragmatically, the challenge is particularly acute. This perspective, the authors argue, presents a challenge to the network literature to consider the mind-set of the managers - or collaborative capacity-builders - who are working to achieve solutions to wicked problems. This mind-set guides network managers as they apply their skills, strategies, and tools in order to foster the transfer, receipt, and integration of knowledge across the network and, ultimately, to build long-term collaborative problem-solving capacity. {\textcopyright} 2008 The American Society for Public Administration.},

abstract = {Purpose - The objective of this paper is to study the development of e-government initiatives at the regional and local level in the EU through the opinion of those agents directly involved in the projects. Design/methodology/ approach - The authors wrote a questionnaire that was sent to the regions and the largest cities of EU countries, in order to find out their degree of involvement in e-government initiatives. Responses were received from 47 regional and local governments. Findings - At present, most regional and local governments have a web site, although in most cases it is little more than a governmental billboard. E-government is not likely to remodel governance in the short term, since democracy initiatives are not on the present agenda of most EU countries. The survey findings show that e-government initiatives are still predominantly non-interactive and non-deliberative. They tend to reflect present service delivery patterns, not transform them. Research limitations/ implications - The construction and management of web sites is becoming an essential element of modern public administration, but little is known about how these initiatives are being implemented. Given the substantial investment in time and other resources for governmental online initiatives, it is essential to begin to evaluate governmental web site initiatives in terms of quality and effectiveness. Originality/value - This work is of value as, to date, there are very few studies that benchmark local government web sites across the EU. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Positing that the MI-performance relationship is complex and is conditional over other characteristics of the organization, we examine the influence of MI on organizational performance both directly and indirectly through performance management (PM). PM is an important organizational process characteristic arising from public management reform and in itself influences performance. We test our hypotheses using structural equation models with data from three sources in English local governments. The findings indicate that the impact of MI on performance is not direct; it is mediated by PM. We also find that PM positively affects organizational performance. In conclusion, we discuss the implications of these findings for research and practice. {\textcopyright} The Author 2010.

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to identify those factors which account for administrative innovation in municipal government bureaucracies. Two dimensions of administrative innovation are examined: management and technology. Management innovation refers to procedures and methods by which policies are implemented. Technology innovation refers to the adoption of new physical products or processes. Multiple indicators of specific innovative practices are used to create a management scale and a technology scale and the two scales are then combined to create a composite administration innovation scale. In order to explain the dimensions of innovation the study employs a model comprised of three sets of independent variables: community variables, political system variables, and bureaucratic variables. Multiple regression analysis is used to examine the relationship between each set of independent variables and the dimensions of innovation. A second stage of analysis combines the three sets of explanatory variables into a single equation for each type of innovation. The results indicate that the three sets of variables are of significant power in explaining innovation, although as one moves from community variables to political variables to bureaucratic variables there is a decline in the amount of variation explained. Some variables are more important for certain types of innovation than for others, but population size, community growth rate, and electoral competition cut across the various types of innovation. {\textcopyright} 1985, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

However, the obstacles, which prevent a rapid progress into that direction, are not merely technical. In fact, the technology side may prove the least difficult to address, while the organizational, legal, political, and social aspects may prove much more of a challenge. The case in point presented in this paper is Washington State's Justice Information Network (JIN), which attempts to share and interoperate criminal and judicial information between state and local governments. Progress towards sustainable information sharing requires many players seeking the same ends in an ongoing fashion, not just a huge upfront and one-time effort as the case illustrates.},

Moreover, in a pluralistic society there is nothing like the undisputable public good; there is no objective definition of equity; policies that respond to social problems cannot be meaningfully correct or false; and it makes no sense to talk about "optimal solutions" to social problems unless severe qualifications are imposed first.

An assessment analysis of the status quo and the emerging trends is made using the e-readiness index in the context of an e-City Governance Integrated Framework. The discussion is based on literature review, survey, and case study research undertaken as part of the IntelCities Integrated Project. Particularly, the ongoing changes in twelve European cities are considered using a set of nine qualitative indicators taken in relation. Future progress, policy priorities and investment opportunities are linked to strategic development trends, governance challenges, institutional (process and management) change, and policy innovation. Consequently, nine propositions about the future of e-City Governance in Europe are formulated. A conclusion is then made that urban governments will need to adapt their e-governance approaches to innovation policy-making strategically and in the light of the emerging pressures from the competitive city in the global economy and a more complex networked and knowledge urban society that will bring about the intelligent city and region of tomorrow.},

abstract = {The current literature on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and planning suggests that the use of Information Technology (IT) in local government can enhance the management and functioning of cities. Of particular interest is the phenomenon of e-government, where debates and information surrounding local government matters are conducted in cyberspace. Of relevance also, are the networking opportunities that the Internet can facilitate between city governments and the institutional learning that can emanate from that. The increasing use of web-based Geographic Information Systems (GIS) applications raises awareness of spatial issues that impact on defined municipal areas, whilst interactive mapping provides opportunities for addressing spatial concerns virtually. Most of the literature does, however, focus on the experience of developed countries where capacity and resources permit a sophisticated understanding of ICT. Yet, evidence suggests that these tools are also used in some developing countries, with India often cited as one of the leading countries in achieving ICT prominence, but little seems to be published about this experience in Southern Africa. There are a number of innovative initiatives underway in South African local governments but most of these interventions are in their infancy. In contrast, there are a number of examples in developed countries that may provide some guidance for developing cities. This paper examines the Smart City initiative in Brisbane in Australia, and compares it with moves currently underway in Durban, South Africa to incorporate ICT in local governance. The intention is to expose the differences in approach, understand the capacity and resource issues that may impact, and draw some conclusions with regards to future interventions in Durban. Overall, the paper provides an initial conceptual landscape that begins to determine the extent to which ICT in local government can provide opportunities for Durban by learning from the experience of Brisbane, Australia. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

These elements include external drivers related to performance, including operational excellence and cost efficiency. They also comprise internal facilitators such as a more flexible culture, an investment in people, a focus on branding, and the deliberate application and transfer of knowledge. The implications are twofold. First, that innovation and entrepreneurship in the public sector can go beyond government policy-making, with the SOE model representing an important policy decision and sector of the New Zealand Government. And second, that the impact of several SOEs on international markets suggests competition on the global stage will increasingly come from both public and private sector organisations. {\textcopyright} 2011 eContent Management.},

It is the result of an initiative of the Chilean government to reinforce its e-government strategy. The proposed model, called eGov-MM (e-Government Maturity Model), has three dimensions (a cube) supporting business processes: information criteria, IT resources, and leverage domains. Changing the traditional and exclusive focus on IT, four Leverage Domains are defined: e-Strategy, IT Governance, Process Management, and People and Organization Capabilities. The Leverage Domains generate a hierarchical structure with a second level named Key Domain Areas. These areas should be measurable and controllable, so they are related to a third hierarchical level, called Critical Variables, allowing the model's elements to be assessed qualitatively and quantitatively. The capability and maturity of these variables associated with the intersection with the other two axes of the cube establish five levels of capability. The proposed model is strongly supported by the international experience and best practices for IT management and has already been field tested. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2008.},

Yet despite numerous examples of this 'urban labelling' phenomenon, we know surprisingly little about so-called smart cities, particularly in terms of what the label ideologically reveals as well as hides. Due to its lack of definitional precision, not to mention an underlying self-congratulatory tendency, the main thrust of this article is to provide a preliminary critical polemic against some of the more rhetorical aspects of smart cities. The primary focus is on the labelling process adopted by some designated smart cities, with a view to problematizing a range of elements that supposedly characterize this new urban form, as well as question some of the underlying assumptions/ contradictions hidden within the concept. To aid this critique, the article explores to what extent labelled smart cities can be understood as a high-tech variation of the 'entrepreneurial city', as well as speculates on some general principles which would make them more progressive and inclusive.},

abstract = {This paper describes the information technology (IT) foundation and principles for Smarter Cities. Smarter Cities are urban areas that exploit operational data, such as that arising from traffic congestion, power consumption statistics, and public safety events, to optimize the operation of city services. The foundational concepts are instrumented, interconnected, and intelligent. Instrumented refers to sources of near-real-time real-world data from both physical and virtual sensors. Interconnected means the integration of those data into an enterprise computing platform and the communication of such information among the various city services. Intelligent refers to the inclusion of complex analytics, modeling, optimization, and visualization in the operational business processes to make better operational decisions. This approach enables the adaptation of city services to the behavior of the inhabitants, which permits the optimal use of the available physical infrastructure and resources, for example, in sensing and controlling consumption of energy and water, managing waste processing and transportation systems, and applying optimization to achieve new efficiencies among these resources. Additional roles exist in intelligent interaction between the city and its inhabitants and further contribute to operational efficiency while maintaining or enhancing quality of life. {\textcopyright} 2010 IBM.},

abstract = {Producing literature reviews of complex evidence for policymaking questions is a challenging methodological area. There are several established and emerging approaches to such reviews, but unanswered questions remain, especially around how to begin to make sense of large data sets drawn from heterogeneous sources. Drawing on Kuhn's notion of scientific paradigms, we developed a new method - meta-narrative review - for sorting and interpreting the 1024 sources identified in our exploratory searches. We took as our initial unit of analysis the unfolding 'storyline' of a research tradition over time. We mapped these storylines by using both electronic and manual tracking to trace the influence of seminal theoretical and empirical work on subsequent research within a tradition. We then drew variously on the different storylines to build up a rich picture of our field of study. We identified 13 key meta-narratives from literatures as disparate as rural sociology, clinical epidemiology, marketing and organisational studies. Researchers in different traditions had conceptualised, explained and investigated diffusion of innovations differently and had used different criteria for judging the quality of empirical work. Moreover, they told very different over-arching stories of the progress of their research. Within each tradition, accounts of research depicted human characters emplotted in a story of (in the early stages) pioneering endeavour and (later) systematic puzzle-solving, variously embellished with scientific dramas, surprises and 'twists in the plot'. By first separating out, and then drawing together, these different meta-narratives, we produced a synthesis that embraced the many complexities and ambiguities of 'diffusion of innovations' in an organisational setting. We were able to make sense of seemingly contradictory data by systematically exposing and exploring tensions between research paradigms as set out in their over-arching storylines. In some traditions, scientific revolutions were identifiable in which breakaway researchers had abandoned the prevailing paradigm and introduced a new set of concepts, theories and empirical methods. We concluded that meta-narrative review adds value to the synthesis of heterogeneous bodies of literature, in which different groups of scientists have conceptualised and investigated the 'same' problem in different ways and produced seemingly contradictory findings. Its contribution to the mixed economy of methods for the systematic review of complex evidence should be explored further. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Purpose - To provide an integrated architecture framework for e-government that represents the alignment of IT infrastructure with business process management in public sector organisations and classify the barriers that might complicate the implementation of the proposed architecture framework. The study will help IT practitioners in the public sector learn how to use and manage information technologies to revitalise business processes, improve decision-making, and gain a competitive advantage from the adoption of e-government. The proposed architecture framework for e-government adoption will reduce confusion surrounding e-government infrastructure in the public sector through understanding the implementation processes, identifying requirements of information and communications technology tools, highlighting the importance of the organisational management resources and the impact of barriers. Design/methodology/approach - A range of earlier studies have been critically examined and analysed to provide an integrated architecture framework for e-government adoption that can address and identify the standards, infrastructure components, applications, and technologies for e-government. The authors have divided the architecture framework into four layers; access layer, e-government layer, e-business layer, and infrastructure layer; each layer addresses a particular aspect of e-government architecture. This paper then presents a critical analysis of barriers experienced in public sector organisations, which prevent the successful adoption of e-government; such barriers being presented in a taxonomy. Findings - Defined organisational and technological requirements that will be necessary for the adoption of e-government in public sector organisations through construct an integrated architecture framework for e-government. The difficulties and barriers that have been experienced in public sector organisations which complicate the implementation process of e-government have been analysed and then identified and presented in a taxonomy. Originality/value - The paper provides architecture framework for e-government adoption that can help to guide IT managers recognise the technological and organisational requirements for e-government adoption in public sector organisations. The framework can also help the decision makers to set a vision statement and strategic action plan for future direction in the information technology age through identifying key elements and stages for action. The authors also identify and classify the perceived barriers that might complicate the implementation process of e-government projects. The awareness of these barriers is important for any e-government project since they will alert the e-government project team with any problems or challenges might be existed during the implementation process so they will be ready to overcome them. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

With this opportunity, public sector e-services are given tools to engage their own employees in an atmosphere that not only fosters new ideas, but provides a framework for managing prototypes and pilot projects that encourage experimentation. In addition, this environment encourages collaboration and breaking down walls of information asymmetries between various stakeholders. Public sector e-services has a legacy of a risk adverse environment where many times the focus is on the politically charged short-term delivery of goals and results, lacking a long-term strategy of managing the risk and renewal cycle around service innovation. The promises and potential that Web 2.0 technologies may provide still have to deal with fragile systems that are currently in place in public sector e-services. Government regulators, consumer advocacy groups, and e-services need to understand how Internet innovation affects the end user/consumer directly. The central premise being that these groups are modeling consumer trends and may be making decisions on false or fabricated information, even suggesting this could lead to inhibiting overall Internet innovation. {\textcopyright} 2011 eContent Management.},

Quantitative results from public sector innovation awards indicate that bottomup innovation occurs much more frequently than conventional wisdom would indicate. Effective political leadership in a crisis requires decision making that employs a wide search for information, broad consultation, and skeptical examination of a wide range of options. Successful leadership of a turnaround requires an agency head to regain political confidence, reach out to stakeholders and clients, and to convince dispirited staff that change is possible and that their efforts to do better will be supported. Political leaders and agency heads can create a supportive climate for bottomup innovation by consulting staff, instituting formal awards and informal recognition for innovators, promoting innovators, protecting innovators from controloriented central agencies, and publicly championing bottomup innovations that have proven successful and have popular appeal. {\textcopyright} 2002, MCB UP Limited},

Against the view that questions, for example, the continued specificity of the urban in an era increasingly mediated by locationally liberating, advanced telecommunications and rapid transport networks, some strands of urban research assert that cities are becoming more important as the key creative, control and cultural centres within globalizing economic, cultural and social dynamics. Building on these strands, this paper evaluates the assets that cities and metropolitan regions provide in an era of globalization. It attempts to develop an alternative perspective on the city based on the idea that contemporary urban life is founded on the heterogeneity of economic, social, cultural and institutional assets, and concludes by using this perspective to- develop implications for urban policy and the quest for social and territorial justice. {\textcopyright} Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers) 1997.},

Scopus covers a wider journal range, of help both in keyword searching and citation analysis, but it is currently limited to recent articles (published after 1995) compared with Web of Science.

@article{Capdevila2015,
abstract = {Purpose – In recent years, the term “smart city” has attracted a lot of attention from policy makers, business leaders and citizenship in general. Although there is not a unique definition of what a smart city is, it is generally accepted that “smart” urban policies refer to local governments' initiatives that use information and communication technologies in order to increase the quality of life of their inhabitants while contributing to a sustainable development. So far, “smart city” approaches have generally been related to top-down processes of technology diffusion. The purpose of this paper is to present a broader view on “smart” initiatives to analyze both top-down and bottom-up dynamics in a smart city. The authors argue that these two perspectives are complementary and its combination can reinforce the collaboration between different city stakeholders. Top-down and bottom-up initiatives are not opposed forces but, on the contrary, can have a synergistic effect on the innovation capacity of the city. Both perspectives are illustrated by providing examples of different “smart” aspects in the city of Barcelona: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. Design/methodology/approach – To illustrate the arguments, the authors analyze the case of the city of Barcelona providing examples of top-down and bottom-up initiatives in four different smart city aspects: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. The research method is based on a case study (Yin, 1984). The primary data consisted on interviews to city council representatives as well as managers of local public institutions, like economic development offices, and local organizations like for instance coworking spaces. The authors interviewed also specialists on the innovation history of the city in order to validate the data. In addition, the authors used secondary data such as reports on the 22@, and documentation on the Barcelona innovation policies, as well as doing a compilation of press articles and the online content of the institutional webpages. All together, the authors have followed a data triangulation strategy to seek data validation based on the cross-verification of the analyzed data sources. Findings – The analysis suggests that the top-down and bottom-up perspectives are complementary and their combination can reinforce the collaboration between different city stakeholders. Top-down and bottom-up initiatives are not opposed forces but, on the contrary, can have a synergistic effect on the innovation capacity of the city. Both perspectives are illustrated by providing examples of different “smart” aspects in the city of Barcelona: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. Research limitations/implications – Nevertheless, the analysis has its limitations. Even if the authors have emphasized the importance of the bottom-up initiatives, citizens do not have often the resources to act without governmental intervention. This is the case of services that require high-cost infrastructures or regulatory changes. Also, as it usually happens in the case of disruptive technology, it is hard for citizens to understand the possibilities of its use. In these cases, firms and institutions must play an important role in the first phases of the diffusion of innovations, by informing and incentivizing its use. It is also important to note that some of the emerging usages of technology are confronted to legal or regulatory issues. For instance, distributed and shared Wi-Fi networks might be in opposition to economic interests of internet providers, that often difficult its expansion. It is also the case of services of the sharing economy that represent a menace to established institutions (like the tensions between Uber and taxi companies, or Airbnb and hotels). In these cases, city halls like it is the case in Barcelona, tend to respond to these emergent uses of technology by regulating to ensure protection to existing corporate services. Practical implications – In conclusion, the transformational process that leads a city to become a smart city has to take in consideration the complexity and the plurality of the urban reality. Beyond considering citizens as being users, testers or consumers of technology, local administrations that are able to identify, nourish and integrate the emerging citizens' initiatives would contribute to the reinforcement of a smart city reality. Originality/value – The contribution of the paper is to go beyond the generalized technologic discourse around smart cities by adding the layer of the citizens' initiatives.},

Since the early work of Everett Rogers, the adoption of innovation literature has attracted considerable attention and has continued to grow rapidly, resulting in a large but fragmented body of literature. The goal of this study is to provide a coherent overview of the theoretical cornerstones as well as recent research trends in the innovation adoption literature. To this end, we conducted a bibliometric review and performed bibliographic coupling and co-citation analysis. First, based on co-citation analysis, we illustrate that innovation adoption research is built on four theoretical cornerstones including: institutional theory; theory of reasoned action; theory concerning the determinants of adoption, and; diffusion theory. Second, bibliographic coupling was used to assess the current research trends. This review is the first to identify thematic areas in an exhaustive manner revealing five clusters of thematic related publications or “research trends”: determinants of IT adoption; adoption of technological standards; organizational rationales associated with adoption; modelling diffusion, and; adoption of agricultural innovations. We conclude this review with the limitations and future research orientations in the field of innovation adoption.},

We used two cities to examine the underlying differences of these two approaches in terms of service enhancement, resource implications, and the sustainability of service development. The first case focused on creating business value through the use of technology by enhancing existing services and/or bringing new services whereas the second case started with creating an infrastructure that served as a technology platform to induce changes in business practices. We found that the first case accumulated business value faster with more new services made available to the public. In contrast, the second case was more resource-intensive and relatively slower in bringing new services to the general public, yet the services were much improved and sustainable over time. {\textcopyright} 2011 by The Society of Urban Technology.},

abstract = {Prior research has provided valuable insights into how and why employees make a decision about the adoption and use of information technologies (ITs) in the workplace. From an organizational point of view, however, the more important issue is how managers make informed decisions about interventions that can lead to greater acceptance and effective utilization of IT. There is limited research in the IT implementation literature that deals with the role of interventions to aid such managerial decision making. Particularly, there is a need to understand how various interventions can influence the known determinants of IT adoption and use. To address this gap in the literature, we draw from the vast body of research on the technology acceptance model (TAM), particularly the work on the determinants of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, and: (i) develop a comprehensive nomological network (integrated model) of the determinants of individual level (IT) adoption and use; (ii) empirically test the proposed integrated model; and (iii) present a research agenda focused on potential pre- and postimplementation interventions that can enhance employees' adoption and use of IT. Our findings and research agenda have important implications for managerial decision making on IT implementation in organizations. {\textcopyright} 2008, Decision Sciences Institute.},

abstract = {This paper sees a smart city not as a status of how smart a city is but as a city's effort to make itself smart. The connotation of a smart city represents city innovation in management and policy as well as technology. Since the unique context of each city shapes the technological, organizational and policy aspects of that city, a smart city can be considered a contextualized interplay among technological innovation, managerial and organizational innovation, and policy innovation. However, only little research discusses innovation in management and policy while the literature of technology innovation is abundant. This paper aims to fill the research gap by building a comprehensive framework to view the smart city movement as innovation comprised of technology, management and policy. We also discuss inevitable risks from innovation, strategies to innovate while avoiding risks, and contexts underlying innovation and risks. Copyright 2011 ACM.},

abstract = {This study aims to explore factors influencing behavioral intention to adopt hearing aids among old adults in smart cities. It argues that trust is a moderator to influence the relationship between attitude, subjective norm and individual's behavioral intention in smart cities. This study tests hypotheses using a sample of 103 respondents from six smart cities in China. The results reveal that attitude is main factor influencing individual's behavioral intention. Subjective norm and trust are both not statistically significant at the 95% confidence interval in the model of multiple-regression. Interestingly, it finds that trust moderates the relationship between subjective norm and individual's behavioral intention. It means that the audiologists' advice can positively affect person's behavioral intention in smart cities. The findings imply that the Theory of Reasoned Action can be partially used to explain the person's behavioral intention in Chinese context. This study contributes to encourage old people to use smart hospitals to consult audiologists about hearing loss and hearing aids rehabilitation. Hence, hearing aids can improve their quality of life (QoL), which can be reflected by the improved standard of living, better access to treatments and also the positive sentiment about their life, including comfort, friendship, happiness and a closer connection to the society.},

abstract = {The concept of Smart City embraces several definitions depending on the meanings of the word “smart”: intelligent city, knowledge city, ubiquitous city, sustainable city, digital city, etc. Many definitions of Smart City exist, but no one has been universally acknowledged yet. From literature analysis it emerges that Smart City and Digital City are the most used terminologies in literature to indicate the smartness of a city. This Chapter explores the literature about Smart City and Digital City from 1993 to the end of 2012 in order to investigate how these two concepts were born, how they have developed, which are the shared features and differences between them. To accomplish with these goals, three steps were followed: (1) to set up a search strategy for systematic literature review to collect a representative subset of papers about Smart City and Digital City using Google Scholar; (2) to store the selected subset in an ad-doc database to synthesize the literature review; (3) to organize the literature review subset to extract quantitative and qualitative data and information about Smart City and Digital City evolution. The author proposes a literature review taxonomy through five specific analysis: (1) time analysis, to explore the causes of the trend of Smart City and Digital City literature in the latest twenty years; (2) terminology analysis, to examine how and where these two ideas were born and what have been the main events influenced their development; (3) definitions analysis, to select and compare the most cited and validated definitions of Smart City and Digital City trying to identify similarities, differences or overlaps between these two concepts; (4) typology analysis, to investigate if Smart City and Digital City are included into a specific urban strategy pursued by government or if they face specific urban problems without a comprehensive framework; (5) geographic analysis, to understand where are the largest concentrations of Smart Cities and Digital Cities in the world and which are their main characteristics and best practices.},

abstract = {According to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal No. 3 (SDG – Goal 3), for sustainable development it is imperative to ensure health and well-being across all ages, and is achievable only through effective and continuous healthcare monitoring. But in India and other third world countries, healthcare monitoring is poor compared to other countries in the world, in spite of it being affordable. The global healthcare smart wearable healthcare (SWH) devices market is expected to rise up at a CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 5.6% and by 2020 it is expected to reach 25 Billion (GVR Report, 2016). The growing incidences of lifestyle diseases, sedentary lifestyle, busy work schedules, technological advancements in healthcare monitoring devices, and increased usage of remote devicesseems to be some of the important factors fuelling this growth. Some of the major players in this segment are Abbott Laboratories, Philips Healthcare, Life Watch, GE Healthcare, Omron Healthcare, Siemens Healthcare and Honeywell International Inc. etc. But in spite of the healthcare monitoring devices are being predicted to be technologically innovative and providing advanced as well as basic health care monitoring features and available in various price ranges based on the features, we wanted to empirically study the attitude towards adoption of such devices in India. India has traditionally been having a very lackadaisical attitude towards healthcare monitoring. In such a context, what would be the factors influencing the adoption of SWH devices. Remote health monitoring can enhance the nature of wellbeing administration and to lessen the aggregate expense in human services by maintaining a strategic distance from pointless hospitalizations and guaranteeing that the individuals who need critical consideration get it sooner. This empirical investigation would provide a detailed insight as to how these wearable Internet Of Things devices would bring about a revolution in the healthcare industry. It would also provide the future prospect of IOT devices in this sector and how the probability of increase in its usage can be increased with time. The paper explores intrusiveness (INTR), Comfort (C), perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (EOU) of SWH devices. The study hypothesized the Impact of PU and EOU, INTR and C on attitude and intention to use towards adoption of SWH devices. Partial Least Square Structured Equation Modeling (PLS – SEM) methodology was applied to explore the relationships between the concepts and hypothesis. The data was collected from 273 respondents. The age group of the respondents was between 25 and 40 years. The results indicated that intrusiveness and comfort do not have a significant direct impact on Intention to use BI (Behavior Intention) BI SWH devices. At the same time Intrusiveness had a significant impact on PU of SWH devices and Comfort has a strong significant impact on PU and EOU of smart wearables. The research has strong implications in the current emerging context of smart wearables, their design and effectiveness. Also the research can have lasting implications on elderly health and well-being. There are very few empirical studies in the area of SWH devices. Most of the studies till now are conceptual studies or providing technology architectures and frameworks. The research in this area is still at a very nascent stage and very few studies have been done to explore the use and adoption of SWH devices.},

Using structural covariance analysis, the study found that first, the product specific characteristics of HET-relative advantage, compatibility, ease of use, and presence-had significant impact on perceived usefulness. Especially significant were the effects of ease of use and presence. Second, relative advantage, compatibility, ease of use, and presence were all found significant in their effects on perceived enjoyment with ease of use and relative advantage being relatively more significant. Third, the perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment had significant impact on the adoption intention of HET products, with perceived enjoyment being more significant than perceived usefulness, which explains hedonic motives of HET product use. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Over the last 18 years, due to its popularity, the TAM has been augmented by including various context-specific constructs to explain phenomenon in e-commerce, e-learning, e-banking, and wireless technologies besides information systems. This study, in the context of e-commerce, or more specifically the online purchase behavior, attempts to consolidate a cohort of existing constructs using the emerging tenets of Customer Value-based Theory and reinstate the parsimonious intentions of TAM. A total of 1730 questionnaires were collected from Internet users who owned a credit card. The respondents came from all the State capitals in Malaysia, including Cyberjaya, which is the smart city of the Multimedia Super Corridor in Malaysia. Out of 1730 questionnaires, 1440 formed the sample for further data analysis. Bivariate, partial correlations and stepwise multiple regression were used in this study to determine the impact of customer value. The results have shown that Perceived Customer Value is an important determinant of Online Transactions Behavior. With the presence of Perceived Customer Value, only Behavioral Intention is a significant predictor on Online Purchase Behavior. Hence, the Customer Value-Based Model is proposed to obtain a parsimonious conceptualization in predicting consumer acceptance of e-commerce transactions.},

Intentionally focused on citizen-centricity, away from bureaucratic perspectives that most typologies have taken, this typology is derived from marketing and service science literature. The proposed typology consists of four dimensions: mode of technology (automate-informative-transformative), purpose of service (hedonic-utilitarian), service authority (voluntary-mandatory), and delivery mode (passive-interactive). This typological framework is validated with a qualitative exercise of classifying inventories of actual smart city services in practice into the framework. Exercise results revealed that the categories provided are mutually exclusive and comprehensively exhaustive in general, and useful in further conceptualization of new services by identifying gaps in reality. In practice, this typology would be useful in positioning specific smart city service under development in terms of citizen-centricity. Urban planners and administrators may use this framework in understanding the pattern of their service development. Also, this framework may provide a useful guideline for service designer pinpointing the design characteristics of old and new smart city services from the perspective of users and customers of city services: citizens. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

The objective of this study is to bring back much needed focus on motivation dichotomy from the consumer perspective. This involved a systematic review and meta-analysis of hedonic motivation an affective construct in UTAUT2 studies. The findings from 79 UTAUT2 empirical studies revealed that only 46 studies (58%) utilised hedonic motivation while the remaining 33 studies (42%) omitted the construct. Extrinsic motivation was the major driver of non-hedonic and non-significant hedonic motivation studies with individuals using technologies for utilitarian outcomes. Unlike UTAUT2, moderators association of hedonic motivation were non-significant in determining consumer intention to use technology. The findings also revealed an important association between hedonic motivation and effort expectancy, in addition to fruitful directions for research and practice.},

abstract = {Telehealth has become an increasingly applied solution to delivering health care to rural and underserved areas by remote health care professionals. This study integrated social capital theory, social cognitive theory, and the technology acceptance model (TAM) to develop a comprehensive behavioral model for analyzing the relationships among social capital factors (social capital theory), technological factors (TAM), and system self-efficacy (social cognitive theory) in telehealth. The proposed framework was validated with 365 respondents from Nantou County, located in Central Taiwan. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to assess the causal relationships that were hypothesized in the proposed model. The finding indicates that elderly residents generally reported positive perceptions toward the telehealth system. Generally, the findings show that social capital factors (social trust, institutional trust, and social participation) significantly positively affect the technological factors (perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness respectively), which influenced usage intention. This study also confirmed that system self-efficacy was the salient antecedent of perceived ease of use. In addition, regarding the samples, the proposed model fitted considerably well. The proposed integrative psychosocial-technological model may serve as a theoretical basis for future research and can also offer empirical foresight to practitioners and researchers in the health departments of governments, hospitals, and rural communities. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract = {Information technology (IT) acceptance research has yielded many competing models, each with different sets of acceptance determinants. In this paper, we (1) review user acceptance literature and discuss eight prominent models, (2) empirically compare the eight models and their extensions, (3) formulate a unified model that integrates elements across the eight models, and (4) empirically validate the unified model. The eight models reviewed are the theory of reasoned action, the technology acceptance model, the motivational model, the theory of planned behavior, a model combining the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior, the model of PC utilization, the innovation diffusion theory, and the social cognitive theory. Using data from four organizations over a six-month period with three points of measurement, the eight models explained between 17 percent and 53 percent of the variance in user intentions to use information technology. Next, a unified model, called the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), was formulated, with four core determinants of intention and usage, and up to four moderators of key relationships. UTAUT was then tested using the original data and found to outperform the eight individual models (adjusted R2 of 69 percent). UTAUT was then confirmed with data from two new organizations with similar results (adjusted R2 of 70 percent). UTAUT thus provides a useful tool for managers needing to assess the likelihood of success for new technology introductions and helps them understand the drivers of acceptance in order to proactively design interventions (including training, marketing, etc.) targeted at populations of users that may be less inclined to adopt and use new systems. The paper also makes several recommendations for future research including developing a deeper understanding of the dynamic influences studied here, refining measurement of the core constructs used in UTAUT, and understanding the organizational outcomes associated with new technology use.},

abstract = {Computer systems cannot improve organizational performance if they aren't used. Unfortunately, resistance to end-user systems by managers and professionals is a widespread problem. To better predict, explain, and increase user acceptance, we need to better understand why people accept or reject computers. This research addresses the ability to predict peoples' computer acceptance from a measure of their intentions, and the ability to explain their intentions in terms of their attitudes, subjective norms, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and related variables. In a longitudinal study of 107 users, intentions to use a specific system, measured after a one-hour introduction to the system, were correlated 0.35 with system use 14 weeks later. The intention-usage correlation was 0.63 at the end of this time period. Perceived usefulness strongly influenced peoples' intentions, explaining more than half of the variance in intentions at the end of 14 weeks. Perceived ease of use had a small but significant effect on intentions as well, although this effect subsided over time. Attitudes only partially mediated the effects of these beliefs on intentions. Subjective norms had no effect on intentions. These results suggest the possibility of simple but powerful models of the determinants of user acceptance, with practical value for evaluating systems and guiding managerial interventions aimed at reducing the problem of underutilized computer technology.},

These two models, the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the task-technology fit model (TTF), provide a much needed theoretical basis for exploring the factors that explain software utilization and its link with user performance. These models offer different, though overlapping perspectives on utilization behavior. TAM focuses on attitudes toward using a particular IT which users develop based on perceived usefulness and ease of use of the IT. TTF focuses on the match between user task needs and the available functionality of the IT. While each of these models offers significant explanatory power, a model that integrates constructs from both may offer a significant improvement over either model alone. We discuss the theoretical foundation of both these models and present a theoretical rationale for an integrated model. The result is an extension of TAM to include TTF constructs. We test our integrated IT utilization model using path analysis. Our integrated model provides more explanatory power than either model alone. Research using the integrated model should lead to a better understanding of choices about using IT.},

Various companies are currently developing technological implants to increase the innate capacity of the human body (insideables) (e.g., memory implants). Public acceptance of this new technology has not yet been investigated in academic research, where studies have instead focused on the ethical and evolutionary implications of insideables. The main aim of this study is the development of a model, namely the Cognitive-Affective-Normative (CAN) model, for assessing the acceptance of new types of technological products. The CAN model combines the cognitive variables perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, as well as the normative variable subjective (or social) norm, from the TAM models with the affective variables positive emotions, negative emotions and anxiety. The CAN model was tested on a sample of 600 randomly selected individuals through structural equation modeling. Data were obtained from a self-administered, online survey. The proposed model explains 73.92% of the intention to use the technological product in the very early stages of its adoption, that is, its early acceptance. Affective and normative factors have the greatest influence on the acceptance of a new technology; within the affective dimension, positive emotions have the greatest impact. Any technology acceptance model should thus consider the emotions that the new technology produces, as well as the influence of the social norm.},

To gain insights into citizens' perspectives, this study uses smart urban safety vignettes to which participants are invited to respond. Using discourse analytical techniques, their interpretations of safety in the smart city are described, which center on functional designs, express lacking influence over technological developments, and reflect on benefits and risks and on their civic roles vis-{\`{a}}-vis technologically mediated urban safety management. Our article concludes by arguing how these findings complement, but also show limitations to traditional technology acceptance models that are as of yet dominant in research of smart urban safety specifically, and smart cities more generally.},

The two most common modes of transportation that would have been used if e-scooters were not available were walking (43.5%) and using a personal vehicle (28.5%). Riding behavior was equally mixed between on the street, on the sidewalk, and equal amounts of both. e-Scooters in Provo are likely having both positive (e.g., air pollution) and negative impacts on health (e.g., injuries, physical inactivity).

We first sketch our vision defining seven goals which concern: developing a new understanding of urban problems; effective and feasible ways to coordinate urban technologies; models and methods for using urban data across spatial and temporal scales; developing new technologies for communication and dissemination; developing new forms of urban governance and organisation; defining critical problems relating to cities, transport, and energy; and identifying risk, uncertainty, and hazards in the smart city. To this, we add six research challenges: to relate the infrastructure of smart cities to their operational functioning and planning through management, control and optimisation; to explore the notion of the city as a laboratory for innovation; to provide portfolios of urban simulation which inform future designs; to develop technologies that ensure equity, fairness and realise a better quality of city life; to develop technologies that ensure informed participation and create shared knowledge for democratic city governance; and to ensure greater and more effective mobility and access to opportunities for urban populations.We begin by defining the state of the art, explaining the science of smart cities. We define six scenarios based on new cities badging themselves as smart, older cities regenerating themselves as smart, the development of science parks, tech cities, and technopoles focused on high technologies, the development of urban services using contemporary ICT, the use of ICT to develop new urban intelligence functions, and the development of online and mobile forms of participation. Seven project areas are then proposed: Integrated Databases for the Smart City, Sensing, Networking and the Impact of New Social Media, Modelling Network Performance, Mobility and Travel Behaviour, Modelling Urban Land Use, Transport and Economic Interactions, Modelling Urban Transactional Activities in Labour and Housing Markets, Decision Support as Urban Intelligence, Participatory Governance and Planning Structures for the Smart City.

Specifically, we investigated Taiwanese citizens' preferences for 35 SC services of seven dimensions classified in two domains, as well as their three perceptions of the usefulness of these SC services in the realization of human needs. The results show that most of our respondents clearly perceived SC services as both important and useful to their existence, relatedness, and growth needs, and that they expressed relatively higher preferences for such services to operate in the “hard” domain – e.g., smart energy, smart transport, or smart safety –than the “soft” one, e.g., smart living. Based on these findings, this study provides policy recommendations that, if implemented, could be expected to advance SC development by increasing citizens' usage of SC services in both the hard and soft domains, and serve the wider aim of improving their well-being and quality of life.},

abstract = {Urban performance currently depends not only on a city's endowment of hard infrastructure (physical capital), but also, and increasingly so, on the availability and quality of knowledge communication and social infrastructure (human and social capital). The latter form of capital is decisive for urban competitiveness. Against this background, the concept of the "smart city" has recently been introduced as a strategic device to encompass modern urban production factors in a common framework and, in particular, to highlight the importance of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in the last 20 years for enhancing the competitive profile of a city. The present paper aims to shed light on the often elusive definition of the concept of the "smart city." We provide a focused and operational definition of this construct and present consistent evidence on the geography of smart cities in the EU27. Our statistical and graphical analyses exploit in depth, for the first time to our knowledge, the most recent version of the Urban Audit data set in order to analyze the factors determining the performance of smart cities. We find that the presence of a creative class, the quality of and dedicated attention to the urban environment, the level of education, and the accessibility to and use of ICTs for public administration are all positively correlated with urban wealth. This result prompts the formulation of a new strategic agenda for European cities that will allow them to achieve sustainable urban development and a better urban landscape. {\textcopyright} 2011 by The Society of Urban Technology.},

abstract = {Valid measurement scales for predicting user acceptance of computers are in short supply. Most subjective measures used in practice are unvalidated, and their relationship to system usage is unknown. The present research develops and vandales new scales for two specific variables, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which are hypothesized to be fundamental determinants of user acceptance. Definitions for these two variables were used to develop scale items that were pretested for content validity and then tested for reliability and construct validity in two studies involving a total of 152 users and four application programs. The measures were refined and stream-lined, resulting in two six-item scales with reliabilities of .98 for usefulness and .94 for ease of use. The scales exhibited high convergent, discriminant, and factorial validity. Perceived usefulness was significantly correlated with both self-reported current usage (r=.63, Study 1) and self-predicted future usage (r=.85, Study 2). Perceived ease of use was also significantly correlated with current usage (r=.45, Study 1) and future usage (r=.59, Study 2). In both studies, usefulness had a significantly greater correlation with usage behavior than did ease of use. Regression analyses suggest that perceived ease of use may actually be a causal antecedent to perceived usefulness, as opposed toy a parallel, direct determinant of system usage. Implications are drawn for future research on user acceptance.},

abstract = {While some cities attempt to determine their residents' demand for smart-city technologies, others simply move forward with smart-related strategies and projects. This study is among the first to empirically determine which factors most affect residents' and public servants' intention to use smart-city services. A Smart Cities Stakeholders Adoption Model (SSA), based on Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2), is developed and tested on a mid-size U.S. city as a case study. A questionnaire was administered in order to determine the influence of seven factors–effort expectancy, self-efficacy, perceived privacy, perceived security, trust in technology, price value and trust in government–on behaviour intention, specifically the decision to adopt smart-city technologies. Results show that each of these factors significantly influenced citizen intention to use smart-city services. They also reveal perceived security and perceived privacy to be strong determinants of trust in technology, and price value a determinant of trust in government. In turn, both types of trust are shown to increase user intention to both adopt and use smart-city services. These findings offer city officials an approach to gauging residential intention to use smart-city services, as well as identify those factors critical to developing a successful smart-city strategy.},

However, currently data release by governments is still novel and there is little experience and knowledge thus far about its benefits, costs and barriers. This is compounded by a lack of understanding about how internal processes influence data release. Our aim in this paper is to get a better understanding of these processes and how they influence data release, i.e., to find determinants for the release of public sector information. For this purpose, we conducted workshops, interviews, questionnaires, desk research and practice based cases in the education program of our university, involving six local public sector organizations. We find that the way data is stored, the way data is obtained and the way data is used by a department are crucial indicators for open data release. We conclude with the lessons learned based on our research findings. These findings are: we should take a nuanced approach towards data release, avoid releasing data for its own sake, and take small incremental steps to explore data release. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Growing interests in e-Government raise the question about the developmental stages of e-Government. Since the year 2000, a number of e-Government stage models have been suggested by international organizations, consulting firms, and individual researchers. However, these models seem to be incongruent with each other as these are based on different perspectives and use somewhat different metaphors. This presents a difficulty not only in understanding different research results, but also in planning future actions for e-Government. Without a common frame of reference for understanding the developmental stages and perspectives reflected in different models and stages, e-Government research may become fragmented and disconnected from each other. In this research, we have conducted a qualitative meta-synthesis of twelve e-Government stage models. Concepts, metaphors, and themes contained in these developmental models are extracted through a series of in-depth semantic analyses of descriptions and explanations. The first order concepts and themes are subjected to an interpretive synthesis identifying reciprocal relationships which in turn leads to the identification of implied metaphors and themes. Five metaphors are identified: presenting, assimilating, reforming, morphing and e-governance, while two underlying themes surface: citizen/service and operation/technology. These concepts, metaphors, and themes are synthesized into a common frame of reference using a reciprocal translation technique. A supportive line of argument is developed for this frame of reference so that different e-Government stage models can be translated into each other. This study contributes to current research through offering theoretical advances related to the stages of e-Government. Furthermore, the metaphors and themes identified in this study would be useful as a conceptual frame for researchers to evaluate and understand the development of e-Government, and as a base road map for practitioners in planning future e-Government projects. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Finding a plethora of competing labels, models, and concepts for coproduction in the age of social media, the paper proposes a unified typology to support systematic analysis based on the overarching categories of "Citizen Sourcing," "Government as a Platform," and "Do-It-Yourself Government." To demonstrate its use, the typology is applied to leading U.S. government implementations.

Some existing strategic frameworks are embedded and incorporated in the matrix. Additionally, we formulate research propositions based on the matrix.

These dichotomies generate a critical knowledge gap because they suggest divergent hypotheses on what principles need to be considered when implementing strategies for enabling smart city development. This paper starts filling such a gap by reporting on the findings of a multiple case study analysis which is conducted into European best practices. In meeting this aim, four European cities considered to be leaders in the field of smart city development are analyzed to test the validity of the hypotheses emerging from each dichotomy. These cities are Amsterdam, Barcelona, Helsinki and Vienna. The results of this best practice analysis offer a series of critical insights into what strategic principles drive smart city development in Europe and generate scientific knowledge which helps to overcome the dichotomous nature of smart city research.},

abstract = {The production and delivery of services differ from manufacturing in ways which have a significant impact on the nature of market competition. Contracts for manufactured goods are centered around a clearly defined junction between production and use, made possible by the properties of tangibility and portability of tangible goods, at which point responsibility for use, operation and consumption of the product is transferred from producer to customer, along with ownership. Service operations, by contrast, involve a lack of inventories and portability, customer contact, joint production, customer-specific inputs, and intangibility in varying degrees. Moreover, service operations are either entirely post contractual or interlinked with the contracting process. As a result, the very nature of service markets and contracting depends on the characteristics of the service operation. While the operational consequences of service characteristics have been explored quite widely, there is less understanding of the special features of service competition and its implications for service strategy. We provide a framework for describing, analyzing and explaining service competition and review some old and new models which address the special features of service markets. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

Research studies have shown that the smart city system primarily focuses on integrating three components: economic, environmental, and social. The social component includes participatory democracy with citizen engagement. In many cases, smart cities focus on discovering answers for various urban problems through the adoption of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) designed to collect citizen feedback, or provide knowledge resources that can improve the quality of urban life. However, there are very few studies that attempt to close the information loop and link problems to solutions in one, unified framework. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate such a unified approach. Using the theoretical lens of dynamic capabilities, we expand the definition of a smart city to include the notion of an urban organization with dynamic capabilities, which operates within cycles of 'sense', 'seize', ‘align', and ‘transform' functions. Our case study focuses on the 'sense' and 'seize' steps, describing a medium-size city in Texas, where an open-ended survey is used as a collection instrument for citizen input and concept-based analytics are employed to convert such input into actionable insights. Our approach has the potential to assist policy makers in designing a comprehensive strategy toward the goal of the smart city.},

The proposed assessment system, composed of nine quantitative metrics, is applied to 100+ major cities worldwide, helping us to identify the best and the worst SC performers.

While proponents argue that smart cities will bring positive social change by the adoption of ICTs, enriched governance and human capital among the citizenry, opponents point out about the negative effects and gaps exist in their planning and execution. Despite efforts to promote its practice, there has been wide criticism about the concept and the way it has been adopted and implemented. The roles of various players, especially the central role of the private sector, is often challenged in the academic literature. A variety of expectations from various stakeholders make the potential implementation strategies even more complex. The current paper reviews the research in the field to date to find that there are conflicting views in smart city planning, which limit our knowledge about the ‘real' smart city and its implications for building creative and inclusive urban space. Such uncertainty at the conceptual level, and the heightened importance given by policy makers and markets to its adoption, highlights the need for proper scrutiny. The paper clusters the various views pertaining to the building of smart cities and, thereby, proposes a 3RC framework, consisting of Restrictive, Reflective, Rationalistic and Critical schools, which critically analyses various stages in the development of the field. The overall aim of the paper is to understand how smart cities differ in their meanings, intentions and ‘offerings'.},

The purpose of this paper is to observe the connections between smart city features as conceptualized in the framework proposed by Giffinger et al. (2007) and new technologies as tools, and sustainability as the goal. Design/methodology/approach – The connections are identified through a content analysis performed using NVivo on official reports issued by organizations, known as industry players within smart city projects, listed in the Navigant Research Report 2013. Findings – The results frame ICT and sustainability as “across-the-board elements” because they connect with all of the services provided to communities in a smart city and play a key role in smart city planning. Specifically, sustainability and ICT can be seen as tools to enable the smartization process. Research limitations/implications – An all-in-one perspective emerges by embedding sustainability and ICT in smart interventions; further research could be conduct through direct interviews to city managers and industry players in order to understand their attitude towards the development of smart city projects. Practical implications – Potential approaches emerging from this research are useful to city managers or large corporations partnering with local agencies in order to increase the opportunities for the long-term success of smart projects. Originality/value – The results of this paper delineate a new research path looking at the development of new models that integrate drivers, ICT, and sustainability in an all-in-one perspective and new indicators for the evaluation of the interventions.},

Smart governance as the intelligent use of ICT to improve decision-making through better collaboration among different stakeholders, including government and citizens, can be strongly related to government approaches. In this case ICT-based tools, such as social media, and openness can be factors that increase citizen engagement and support the development of new governance models for smart government. Smart governance may also have an important role in smart city initiatives, which require complex interactions between governments, citizens and other stakeholders. Based on the literature review, this paper coins a definition of € smart city governance' and contributes to developing a framework for building new, smart governance models addressing the challenges of the digital society, collaborative governance, information sharing, citizen engagement, transparency and openness.},

Although many questions that are covered in the Oslo Manual guidelines for measuring innovation in the private sector can be applied with some modifications to the public sector, public sector innovation surveys need to meet policy needs that require collecting additional types of data. Policy to support public sector innovation requires data on how public sector organizations innovate and how a strategic management approach to innovation can influence the types of innovations that are developed. Both issues require innovations surveys to delve deeply into the innovation processes and strategies that are used by public sector managers. Implementation of the measurement framework proposed in this paper would open up opportunities for a new, policy-relevant research program on public sector innovation.},

abstract = {A city is a large and permanent human ecosystem which provides a lot of services and opportunities to its citizens. The rapid urbanization and increasing population have put a lot of strains on city infrastructures and service deliveries. The current urbanization requires strong strategies and innovative planning to modernize the urban life. Many cities are enhancing quality and performance of urban services by being digitalized, intelligent and smarter. The policymakers and city authorities are exploring solutions to deliver the new services in an efficient, responsive and sustainable manner for a large population. The study explores all the possible services among various city dimensions which can make a city smart. The ideas related to smart services are collected from the peer vetted creative crowdsourcing process performed online in India. A directed qualitative conventional content analysis is used to analyze the collected ideas. The unique ideas are clustered into 19 different service categories. The findings suggest multi-dimensional service classification along with required basic infrastructural development. Further, the Smart City Transformation Framework (SCTF) is proposed to help the policy makers, urban developers, government officials and service providers in terms of understanding and to draw more insights from the suggested smart solutions for development of smart cities. There are four key areas (Planning, Physical infrastructure, ICT infrastructure and Deploying Smart solutions) discussed in the proposed framework to illustrate the city transformation. The proposed SCTF is supported by literature and examples adopted by various smart cities across the world to illustrate its effectiveness. Moreover, a mind map is designed to illustrate the interrelationships among the collected ideas in an attractive and procedural visualization for city transformation process.},

Based on an analysis of academic papers, World Health Organization reports and newspapers, this research compares two opposing approaches, whereas the Chinese cities and government have adopted a techno-driven approach, Western governments have adopted a human-driven approach to control the transmission of Covid-19. The findings highlight that although the techno driven approach may be more productive to identify, isolate and quarantine infected individuals, it also results in the suppression and censoring the citizen views. It is further emphasized that human interaction with the technology is mediated by the political and institutional context in which the technologies are implemented.

abstract = {This study proposes a new typological framework for classifying smart city services. Intentionally focused on citizen-centricity, away from bureaucratic perspectives that most typologies have taken, this typology is derived from marketing and service science literature. The proposed typology consists of four dimensions: mode of technology (automate-informative-transformative), purpose of service (hedonic-utilitarian), service authority (voluntary-mandatory), and delivery mode (passive-interactive). This typological framework is validated with a qualitative exercise of classifying inventories of actual smart city services in practice into the framework. Exercise results revealed that the categories provided are mutually exclusive and comprehensively exhaustive in general, and useful in further conceptualization of new services by identifying gaps in reality. In practice, this typology would be useful in positioning specific smart city service under development in terms of citizen-centricity. Urban planners and administrators may use this framework in understanding the pattern of their service development. Also, this framework may provide a useful guideline for service designer pinpointing the design characteristics of old and new smart city services from the perspective of users and customers of city services: citizens. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Moreover, the current study identifies the factors which may cause to render the managerial acceptance for using BMS through the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). TAM was used to measure four behaviors (latent factors) namely subjective norms, organization support, compatibility, and technology complexity. The data were statistically evaluated via multiple regression analysis using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Results suggested that organization support and compatibility have a significant influence on managerial intentions to use BMS while subjective norms, technology complexity have no significant influence.

abstract = {The pharmacological effects on the central nervous system (CNS) of a range of available flavonoid glycosides were explored and compared to those of the glycosides 2S-hesperidin and linarin, recently isolated from valeriana. The glycosides 2S-neohesperidin, 2S-naringin, diosmin, gossipyn and rutin exerted a depressant action on the CNS of mice following i.p. injection, similar to that found with 2S-hesperidin and linarin. We demonstrate in this work that these behavioural actions, as measured in the hole board, thiopental induced sleeping time and locomotor activity tests, are unlikely to involve a direct action on $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors. The corresponding aglycones were inactive, pointing to the importance of the sugar moieties in the glycosides in their CNS depressant action following systemic administration. The pharmacological properties of the flavonoid glycosides studied here, in addition to our previous results with hesperidin and linarin, opens a promising new avenue of research in the field. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The main goal is to evaluate if increasing design concrete compressive strength would result a better balance between the amounts of steel and concrete, leading to a decrease of environmental impacts and construction costs, followed by an increase in RC structure service life and/or durability. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been used to quantify environmental impacts and embodied energy of three four-pavement commercial office-building designed with C25, C50, and C75 concrete. Service life has been assessed based on design criteria for durability. Results show that for the studied functional unit RC50 presents better results from the environmental and economical point of view. Despite the positive effects regarding durability, the impacts during material production, construction, and demolition proved that, for this case study, the use of RC75 is not economically nor environmentally advantageous when compared to RC50. This study is an evidence that materials choice and structural design parameters are extremely relevant with regard to the environmental impact and service life of reinforced concrete buildings. Results highlight the importance of the inventory data collection on the life cycle analysis.},

The most time-honored and prominent concept is the “sustainable city,” which is depicted as a model urban form and thereafter more city concepts have come into being. However, it is not clear for all the concepts, for instance, “eco-cities,” “smart city,” “sustainable city,” and “resilient city,” what are the underpinning building blocks within each concept and how these concepts correlate with each other. This bibliometric study organizes this in conducting a descriptive summary, a clustering analysis, and multidimensional scaling of major city concepts, by establishing a co-word matrix of high-frequency keywords occurring in the Science Citations Index (SCI) and Social Science Citations Index (SSCI) databases. In addition to summarizing the evolution of these concepts, it analyzes the composition of each city concept and the core issues addressed by each city type. Also investigated are the correlations between the city concepts with a statistical analysis of the clusters of literature in one concept that overlap or connect to other clusters in another. From this, it is shown that, under the two umbrella terms of “sustainable city” and “smart city,” the “? -city” literature has developed in a variety of distinctive ways.},

In order to improve the analysis, PhotoVoltaic technology has been simulated in TRNSYS environment, to obtain detailed prediction of this component of the energy infrastructure. The system behaviour was analysed considering different time bases: daily, weekly and yearly. The EnergyPLAN outputs include the aggregated yearly production and demands of all modelled energy conversion systems, as well as hourly values useful to identify the measures to make Altavilla Silentina nearly zero carbon city. Every measure identified becomes a new input in EnergyPLAN to evaluate its effect on city energy balance.

abstract = {Over the last couple of decades, metropolitan areas around the world have been engaged in a multitude of initiatives aimed at upgrading urban infrastructure and services, with a view to creating better environmental, social and economic conditions and enhancing cities' attractiveness and competitiveness. Reflecting these developments, many new categories of 'cities' have entered the policy discourse: 'sustainable cities'; 'green cities'; 'digital cities'; 'smart cities'; intelligent cities'; 'information cities'; 'knowledge cities'; 'resilient cities'; 'eco cities'; 'low carbon cities'; 'liveable cities'; and even combinations, such as 'low carbon eco cities' and 'ubiquitous eco cities'. In practice, these terms often appear to be used interchangeably by policy makers, planners and developers. However, the question arises whether these categories nevertheless each embody distinct conceptual perspectives, which would have implications for how they are understood theoretically and applied in policy. In response, this article investigates, through a comprehensive bibliometric analysis, how the twelve most frequent city categories are conceptualised individually and in relation to one another in the academic literature. We hypothesize that, notwithstanding some degree of overlap and cross-fertilization, in their essence the observed categories each harbor particular conceptual perspectives that render them distinctive. This is borne out by the findings, which demonstrate robustly for the first time the conceptual differences and interrelationships among twelve dominant city categories. The 'sustainable city' is the most frequently occurring category and, in a map of keyword co-occurrences, by far the largest and most interconnected node, linked closely to the 'eco city' and 'green city' concepts. Recently, the more narrow concepts of 'low carbon city' and 'smart city' have been on the rise, judging by their frequency of occurrence in academic journals; the latter in particular appears to have become an increasingly dominant category of urban modernization policy. On their part, 'resilient city' and 'knowledge city' represent distinct concepts, albeit with comparatively low frequency. Overall, the findings point to the need for rigor and nuance in the use of these terms, not least if one wishes to comprehend their implications for urban development and regeneration policy and practice.},

Since the development of such policies is challenging, there is a need to learn from the experience of many cities around the world offering efficient and successfully adopted smart mobility services. However, in practice, the information provided about such initiatives is shallow and unstructured. To address this issue, we study the state of the art in mobility services, reviewing scientific publications and 42 smart mobility services delivered by nine smart cities around the world, and we propose a taxonomy for planning and designing smart mobility services. The taxonomy provides a common vocabulary to discuss and share information about such services. It comprises eight dimensions: type of services, maturity level, users, applied technologies, delivery channels, benefits, beneficiaries, and common functionality. The contribution of the proposed taxonomy is to serve as a tool for guiding policy makers by identifying a spectrum of mobility services that can be provided, to whom, what technologies can be used to deliver them, and what is the delivered public value so to justify their implementation. In addition, the taxonomy can also assist researchers in further developing the domain. By identifying common functionality, it could also help Information Technology (IT) teams in building and maintaining smart mobility services. Finally, we further discuss usage scenarios of the taxonomy by policy makers, IT staff and researchers.},

Offering a critical synthesis of the material, it advances a Triple Helix inspired account of smart cities as future internet-based developments. In particular, as future internet-based developments covering the digital infrastructures, data management systems, renewable energies and cloud computing of a regional innovation in the Internet of Things (IoT). More specifically, as a regional innovation in the IoT that covers the morphology of urban extensions, infill and mass retrofits, which smart cities call for the development of. Focusing on the metrics of mass retrofit proposals, the paper also serves to demonstrate how the urban morphology of such regional innovations matter in the sense they tell us that being aware of the considerable energy savings and CO2 reductions, which IoTs offer cities to be smart, is not enough. Not enough, because without knowing whether the costs and benefits under-gridding the sustainability of city-districts are shared equally, it is impossible to say if the 65% energy saving and 78% reduction in CO2, attributed to the data collection, information processing and smart (micro) grids of mass retrofits is socially just. The paper suggests that in order to verify this, it is necessary for smart cities to first baseline the social-demographic structure of retrofit proposals. Then draw upon the environmental profile this evaluation generates to assess whether the regional innovation creates the wealth needed to under-grid the sustainability of city-districts. Under-grid the sustainability of city-districts as the energy efficient-low carbon zones of an inclusive growth strategy seen to be socially just. Seen to be socially just, because the costs and benefits underlying the 1.5 ha ecological footprint that surfaces from this regional innovation are equally appropriated as the proceeds of a wealth creation, which contributes to the resilience of city-districts as energy efficient-low carbon zones. As energy efficient-low carbon zones, whose inclusive growth strategy also emerges as a post-carbon economy claiming to be climate neutral.},

This paper integrates the Social Cognitive Theory and the Social Capital Theory to construct a model for investigating the motivations behind people's knowledge sharing in virtual communities. The study holds that the facets of social capital - social interaction ties, trust, norm of reciprocity, identification, shared vision and shared language - will influence individuals' knowledge sharing in virtual communities. We also argue that outcome expectations - community-related outcome expectations and personal outcome expectations - can engender knowledge sharing in virtual communities. Data collected from 310 members of one professional virtual community provide support for the proposed model. The results help in identifying the motivation underlying individuals' knowledge sharing behavior in professional virtual communities. The implications for theory and practice and future research directions are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {With the recent increase in urban population worldwide, and the emergence of big data analytics, there is a growing interest in research on how cities are actively reconstructing themselves into a smart and sustainable city. Research studies have shown that the smart city system primarily focuses on integrating three components: economic, environmental, and social. The social component includes participatory democracy with citizen engagement. In many cases, smart cities focus on discovering answers for various urban problems through the adoption of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) designed to collect citizen feedback, or provide knowledge resources that can improve the quality of urban life. However, there are very few studies that attempt to close the information loop and link problems to solutions in one, unified framework. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate such a unified approach. Using the theoretical lens of dynamic capabilities, we expand the definition of a smart city to include the notion of an urban organization with dynamic capabilities, which operates within cycles of 'sense', 'seize', ‘align', and ‘transform' functions. Our case study focuses on the 'sense' and 'seize' steps, describing a medium-size city in Texas, where an open-ended survey is used as a collection instrument for citizen input and concept-based analytics are employed to convert such input into actionable insights. Our approach has the potential to assist policy makers in designing a comprehensive strategy toward the goal of the smart city.},

A much discussed question in this context is whether voluntary behaviour change initiatives can make a significant contribution to reaching this target. While providing individuals with general information on climate change or low carbon action is increasingly seen as ineffective, some studies argue that personalised information has greater potential to encourage behaviour change. This mixed methods study examines this claim through a longitudinal field experiment which tested the effectiveness of a carbon calculator interview. It finds that the intervention significantly raised awareness of ways in which participants could reduce their carbon footprint. However, this increased awareness did not translate into measurable behaviour changes in relation to home energy and travel. Qualitative analysis shows that participants refer to infrastructural, social and psychological barriers to change. This indicates that more ambitious government and corporate action is required to speed up carbon reduction.},

Eco-city projects are becoming increasingly prevalent in policy and political-economic discourses in a variety of locations as new urban spaces where blueprints for low carbon economies can be trialled. In light of this, the article highlights the key necessity of, firstly, considering scale when analyzing eco-city 'futures'. Secondly, the article argues for the need to interrogate eco-cities' definitions, as well as evaluation, performance and monitoring frameworks, as this will aid in critical analyses of the marketing, presentation and actually built urban environments in eco-city projects. Thirdly, the question of internal social resilience and the emergence of communities within newly-built eco-cities needs to be assessed: this is of crucial importance in light of the exclusive, gated nature of several flagship eco-city projects under construction at the time of writing. Lastly, the article argues that research on eco-city projects needs to consider not only the high-tech, new urban environments materialized as eco-cities, but also the production and reproduction of large, often transient populations of low-paid workers who build eco-cities and who form what the article calls the 'new urban poor', forming 'workers' cities' on the edges of flagship 'sustainable' urban projects worldwide. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In the last decade, the Internet of Things (IoT) has affected the approach of organizations to innovation and how they create and capture value in everyday business activities. This is compounded in the so-called Smart Cities, where the objective of the IoT is to exploit information and communication technologies (ICTs) to support added-value services for citizens, giving companies more opportunities to innovate through the use of the latest technologies. In this context, multinational enterprises (MNEs) are building alliances, starting several projects with public and private city stakeholders aimed at exploring new technologies for cities but also at exploiting new IoT-based devices and services in order to profit from them. This implies that companies need to manage and integrate different types of knowledge to efficiently and effectively support the simultaneous pressure of exploration and exploitation, at a project portfolio level. Using structural equations modeling with data collected from 43 IoT smart city project alliances in Italy, this paper tests and finds evidence that MNEs need to develop knowledge management (KM) capabilities combined with ICT capabilities if they want to obtain greater ambidexterity performance at the project portfolio level. More specifically, we highlight that KM capabilities enhance alliance ambidexterity indirectly through firms' ICT capabilities, suggesting that MNE managers should design KM tools and develop new ICT skills. Implications for academics, managers and future lines of research are proposed.},

This research proposes a theoretical model and present privacy and security as key drivers of citizens' intentions to continue using smartcards. The functional benefits (i.e. usefulness and ease-of-use), the level of personal interaction with local services, and the direct and moderating effects of socio-demographic variables complete our framework. The findings of an empirical study with smartcard users in Zaragoza (Spain) show usefulness and security as the main antecedents of continuance intentions. In turn, the influence of socio-demographic variables is not significant, which suggests that smartcards should focus on a wide-range of users. These results offer interesting implications and recommendations for public managers such as the need to guarantee the security of the transaction system and to expand the number of services and initiatives relaying on the smartcard service in order to gradually develop the smart city transformation.},

abstract = {Urban environments in Latin America must begin decarbonizing their activities to avoid increasing greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions rates due to their reliance on fossil fuel-based energy to support economic growth. In this context, cities in Latin America have high potential to convert sunlight into energy. Hence, the main objective of this study was to determine the potential of electricity self-sufficiency production and mitigation of GHG emissions in three medium-sized cities in Peru through the revalorization of underutilized rooftop areas in urban environments. Each city represented a distinct natural area of Peru: Pacific coast, Andean region and Amazon basin. More specifically, photovoltaic solar systems were the technology selected for implementation in these rooftop areas. Data on incident solar energy, temperature and energy consumption were collected. Thereafter, ArcGis10.3 was used to quantify the total usable area in the cities. A series of correction factors, including tilt, orientation or roof profiles were applied to attain an accurate value of usable area. Finally, Life Cycle Assessment was the methodology chosen to calculate the reduction of environmental impacts as compared to the current context of using electricity from the regional grids. Results showed that the cities assessed have the potential to obtain their entire current electricity demand for residential, commercial and public lighting purposes, augmenting energy security and resilience to intermittent natural disasters, with the support of decentralized storage systems. This approach would also translate into substantial reductions in terms of GHG emissions. Annual reductions in GHG emissions ranged from 112 ton CO2eq in the city of Ayacucho to over 523 kton CO2eq in Pucallpa, showing that cities in the Amazon basin would be the ones that benefit the most in terms of climate change mitigation.},

By defining which smartness dimension each stakeholder primarily focus on and analyzing the consequences of this, the framework pinpoints each stakeholder's contribution and/or hindrance to the process and outcome. A recommendation from this study is that new stakeholder groups are important to involve in smart city planning, but this also adds complexity that must be acknowledged when setting up this kind of projects.

The article builds on a framework of knowledge reservoirs to show why knowledge transfer can be difficult and to identify the kinds of knowledge that are most difficult to transfer to different contexts. The article develops the proposition that interactions among people, tasks, and tools are least likely to fit the new context and hence are the most difficult to transfer. This theoretical result illuminates how organizations can derive competitive advantage by transferring knowledge internally while preventing its external transfer to competitors. Because people are more similar within than between organizations, interactions involving people transfer more readily within than between firms. By embedding knowledge in interactions involving people, organizations can both effect knowledge transfer internally and impede knowledge transfer externally. Thus, knowledge embedded in the interactions of people, tools, and tasks provides a basis for competitive advantage in firms. {\textcopyright} 2000 Academic Press.},

The findings suggest multi-dimensional service classification along with required basic infrastructural development. Further, the Smart City Transformation Framework (SCTF) is proposed to help the policy makers, urban developers, government officials and service providers in terms of understanding and to draw more insights from the suggested smart solutions for development of smart cities. There are four key areas (Planning, Physical infrastructure, ICT infrastructure and Deploying Smart solutions) discussed in the proposed framework to illustrate the city transformation. The proposed SCTF is supported by literature and examples adopted by various smart cities across the world to illustrate its effectiveness. Moreover, a mind map is designed to illustrate the interrelationships among the collected ideas in an attractive and procedural visualization for city transformation process.},

abstract = {Smart-cities research has established itself as one of the most dynamic fields in research today, accommodating scholars from diverse disciplines, including engineering and computer science as well as social sciences. Even if only tacitly, the resultant debate increasingly oscillates around how the effective use of information and communication technology (ICT) might render cities and urban space better places. This article responds to this imperative by suggesting how to capture users' views and perceptions of smart city services and applications and in this way enrich the decision- and policy-making processes. It is argued that by developing appropriate scales these otherwise subjective views and perceptions may be objectivized and hence made of great use to managers and policymakers. Accordingly, in this research, a process of scale development is conducted in four phases of both inductive and deductive methods. Following initial rounds of focus groups and assessment by experts, an international survey was conducted with 295 participants from Europe, Asia, Latin America, the Arab Peninsula, and other regions. The data were analyzed using IBM SPSS 24 and AMOS 20 tools. The study proposes a 20-item scale in five distinct dimensions: Technology anxiety; Work–life interface; Engagement orientation; Support orientation; and Quality of life. The significant theoretical and managerial implications are discussed to demonstrate how to manage information for the benefit of all stakeholders involved in the making of a smart city.},

abstract = {This review paper seeks to emphasise the significance of citizens' adoption of smart urbanism for sustainable smart living. A total of 37 articles have been selected and critically reviewed based on the Sustainable Smart Living framework developed for this paper. This review explores the concept of smart equity among citizens, which empowers them as end-users in cities experiencing the rapid growth of smart urbanism. Citizen adoption is an essential issue for critical consideration to ensure the sustainable smart living throughout urban life. The framework for sustainable smart living has been developed by focusing on citizen adoption in light of essential, interrelated variables, including government role, cognitive entity and intelligence. Based on this framework, the selected articles have been evaluated and analysed in terms of their significance for the sustainable smart living variables. The purposes of this review are twofold: first, to develop a framework for sustainable smart living focusing on citizen adoption; second, to examine the current status of smart city research from a human-centric viewpoint by adopting the framework as a guideline for evaluating and analysing the selected articles on smart urbanism. The results of this review may be extended by future studies on sustainable smart living that focus on smart cities that address citizen adoption from a human-centric viewpoint.},

abstract = {Smart city approaches in city planning have gained significant momentum in the recent past. While proponents argue that smart cities will bring positive social change by the adoption of ICTs, enriched governance and human capital among the citizenry, opponents point out about the negative effects and gaps exist in their planning and execution. Despite efforts to promote its practice, there has been wide criticism about the concept and the way it has been adopted and implemented. The roles of various players, especially the central role of the private sector, is often challenged in the academic literature. A variety of expectations from various stakeholders make the potential implementation strategies even more complex. The current paper reviews the research in the field to date to find that there are conflicting views in smart city planning, which limit our knowledge about the ‘real' smart city and its implications for building creative and inclusive urban space. Such uncertainty at the conceptual level, and the heightened importance given by policy makers and markets to its adoption, highlights the need for proper scrutiny. The paper clusters the various views pertaining to the building of smart cities and, thereby, proposes a 3RC framework, consisting of Restrictive, Reflective, Rationalistic and Critical schools, which critically analyses various stages in the development of the field. The overall aim of the paper is to understand how smart cities differ in their meanings, intentions and ‘offerings'.},

Humanitarian logistics literature has extensively studied epidemic impacts; however, there exists a research gap in understanding of pandemic impacts in commercial SCs. To progress in this direction, we present a systematic analysis of the impacts of epidemic outbreaks on SCs guided by a structured literature review that collated a unique set of publications. The literature review findings suggest that influenza was the most visible epidemic outbreak reported, and that optimization of resource allocation and distribution emerged as the most popular topic. The streamlining of the literature helps us to reveal several new research tensions and novel categorizations/classifications. Most centrally, we propose a framework for operations and supply chain management at the times of COVID-19 pandemic spanning six perspectives, i.e., adaptation, digitalization, preparedness, recovery, ripple effect, and sustainability. Utilizing the outcomes of our analysis, we tease out a series of open research questions that would not be observed otherwise. Our study also emphasizes the need and offers directions to advance the literature on the impacts of the epidemic outbreaks on SCs framing a research agenda for scholars and practitioners working on this emerging research stream.},

abstract = {The current study is a preliminary approach to develop a structural framework of the Internet of Things (IoT) adoption barriers that exist in the waste management systems of smart cities in developing economies such as India. To attain this aim, the present study uses hybrid Multi-criteria decision-making methods (MCDM) and has identified 15 adoption IoT Barriers (IoTBs) from literature review obstructing the IoT implementation in smart cities of India. The IoTBs are further analyzed through the Total Interpretative structural modeling (TISM) approach, the Fuzzy Matriced'Impacts Crois{\'{e}}s Multiplication Appliqu{\'{e}}an Classement (MICMAC) model, and the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method. The TISM approach is used to develop a structural framework of IoTBs in smart cities' waste management (SCWM) projects. The literature shows that several bottlenecks exist. Such bottlenecks may include operational cost and payback; a lack of standardization, regulations, directions, and policy norms; incomplete technical knowledge among policymakers; internet connectivity, privacy, and security issues; or problems with mobility, transparency, and a lack of IT infrastructure; all of these issues influence IoT adoption in SCWM. The present work discloses that the lack of regulations, directions, and policy norms, and the lack of standardization and Internet connectivity are the most critical IoT barriers hindering the development of smart cities, particularly in their waste management practices. The Fuzzy-MICMAC approach is useful in calculating driving and dependence powers of the IoTBs, and the DEMATEL method helps reveal the influence/strength of IoTBs that affect SCWM. This study will help policymakers, stakeholders, and government to understand the significant IoTBs affecting waste management practices, and it will definitely assist them to undertake decisions for eradicating these barriers for a more efficient IoT implementation in SCWM projects.},

abstract = {The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) within the United Nations 2030 Agenda emerged in 2015, becoming an unprecedented global compass for navigating extant sustainability challenges. Nevertheless, it still represents a nascent field enduring uncertainties and complexities. In this regard, the interplay between digitalization and sustainability unfolds bright opportunities for shaping a greener economy and society, paving the way towards the SDGs. However, little evidence exists so far, about a genuine contribution of digital paradigms to sustainability. Besides, their role to tackle the SDGs research gaps remains unexplored. Thus, a holistic characterization of the aforementioned topics has not been fully explored in the emerging literature, deserving further research. The article endeavors a twofold purpose: (1) categorizing the main SDGs research gaps; (2) coupled with a critical exploration of the potential contribution of digital paradigms, particularly Big Data and Artificial Intelligence, towards overcoming the aforesaid caveats and pursuing the 2030 Agenda. Ultimately, the study seeks to bridge literature gaps by providing a first-of-its-kind overview on the SDGs and their nexus with digitalization, while unraveling policy implications and future research directions. The methodology has consisted of a systematic holistic review and in-depth qualitative analysis of the literature on the realms of the SDGs and digitalization. Our findings evidence that the SDGs present several research gaps, namely: flawed understanding of complexities and interlinkages; design shortcomings and imbalances; implementation and governance hurdles; unsuitable indicators and assessment methodologies; truncated adoption and off-target progress; unclear responsibilities and lacking coordination; untapped role of technological innovation and knowledge management. Moreover, our results show growing expectations about the added value brought by digitalization for pursuing the SDGs, through novel data sources, enhanced analytical capacities and collaborative digital ecosystems. However, current research and practice remains in early-stage, pointing to ethical, social and environmental controversies, along with policy caveats, which merit additional research. In light of the findings, the authors suggest a first-approach exploration of research and policy implications. Results suggest that further multidisciplinary research, dialogue and concerted efforts for transformation are required. Reframing the Agenda, while aligning the sustainable development and digitalization policies, seems advisable to ensure a holistic sustainability. The findings aim at guiding and stimulating further research and science-policy dialogue on the promising nexus amid the SDGs and digitalization.},

This paper examines the influence of smart city construction on urban green total factor productivity (GTFP), explores the influence mechanism and further investigates the heterogeneous influence among the factors of urban scale, human capital and financial development, by conducting a quasi-natural experiment based on the first batch of pilot smart city in China and using panel data of 174 prefecture level cities over the period of 2005−2016. Our findings show that: (1) Smart city construction pilot significantly improves GTFP and green technological progress (GTP) in China, but its influence on GTE is not significant, which means smart city construction promotes GTFP mainly through promoting GTP. This conclusion is still valid after a series of robustness tests. (2) The estimation result of mediating effect models is that smart city construction promoted GTFP and GTP mainly through boosting urban technological innovation. The influence path of “smart city construction→technological innovation→GTFP” is verified. (3) Regarding city heterogeneity, cities with larger scale, richer human capital and higher level financial development have stronger positive effects on GTFP and GTP. These conclusions are of vital significance to improve the urban ecological environment and promote the high-quality development of urban economy.},

However, recent developments of machine learning within Big Data environment have not been exploited enough in this domain. This paper aims to answer the question of how to incorporate Big Data platform and machine learning into an intelligent system for managing energy efficiency of public sector as a substantial part of the smart city concept. Deep neural networks, Rpart regression tree and Random forest with variable reduction procedures were used to create prediction models of specific energy consumption of Croatian public sector buildings. The most accurate model was produced by Random forest method, and a comparison of important predictors extracted by all three methods has been conducted. The models could be implemented in the suggested intelligent system named MERIDA which integrates Big Data collection and predictive models of energy consumption for each energy source in public buildings, and enables their synergy into a managing platform for improving energy efficiency of the public sector within Big Data environment. The paper also discusses technological requirements for developing such a platform that could be used by public administration to plan reconstruction measures of public buildings, to reduce energy consumption and cost, as well as to connect such smart public buildings as part of smart cities. Such digital transformation of energy management can increase energy efficiency of public administration, its higher quality of service and healthier environment.},

abstract = {The provision of an adequate network of urban infrastructures is essential to create clean and energy-efficient urban mobility systems. However, the urban infrastructure to support sustainable mobility can produce a substantial environmental burden if no life cycle environmental criteria are applied in its design and management. This paper demonstrates the potential to support energy-efficient and CO2-free pedestrian and electric bike (e-bike) mobility through the ecological design (eco-design) of urban elements. An eco-design approach is applied to reconceptualize a conventional pergola toward an eco-product (solar pergola). The solar pergola generates surplus photovoltaic electricity that provides a multifunctional character. According to the end-use of this energy, different scenarios are analyzed for robust decision-making. The deployment of solar pergolas can contribute to save from 2,080kg to over 47,185kg of CO2 eq. and from 350,390MJ to over 692,760MJ eq. in 10 years, depending on the geographic emplacement (solar radiation and electricity grid system). These savings are equivalent to charging 2-9 e-bikes per day using clean energy. Instead of maximizing infrastructure deployment to shift to environmentally friendly modes of mobility, the implementation of multifunctional urban elements represents a key area of action in the context of smart city development.},

We argue that dyadic analyses are particularly appropriate when the dependent variable is quantitative and/or involves multiple behaviors. We show that system-level analyses, by aggregating potentially significant information, provide a less grounded account of the relations across networks than do dyadic analyses. Using examples from a study of corporate political behavior, we contrast dyadic analyses with those at both the individual and system-levels. Variables measured in raw dyadic form consistently perform better in accounting for similarity of corporate political behavior than do variables measured by taking system-level properties into account. Our findings suggest that although individual and system-level analyses are useful in a number of situations, dyadic analyses are a flexible means to examine the effects of multiple networks at multiple levels. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Smart cities attract considerable attention from academics and urban planners mainly in the context of urban development policies. Based on technological innovations, smart cities are complex ecosystems that have the potential to improve urban livability, workability and sustainability through a network of people, processes and data. However, according to academics and urban planners the smart city concept favors technological products and solutions over end users and their quality of life. This perspective calls for an integrated analysis approach that considers the smart city as an organic whole, which encompasses objective and subjective quality of life domains (QOL). This paper aimed to evaluate the perception of quality of life in a smart city and to analyze the main elements of citizens' satisfaction with their home city. The research analyzed the city of Curitiba, in Southern Brazil, claimed to be a livable, green, and inclusive city and one of the ten smartest cities in the world. Interviews with 400 residents identified four main QOL domains: socio-structural relationships, environmental well-being, material well-being and community integration. The respondents' overall perception revealed their low satisfaction with the main elements that characterize Curitiba as a smart city. This finding calls for a better understanding of the planning and management of smart cities in conjunction with the QOL elements and their effects on citizens. The research provides some contributions to understand the interconnected facets of QOL domains in the Smart Cities context. From a smart city perspective, the research concludes that success within the domain of smart living can be achieved by providing the four factors revealed by the analysis. According to our results, meeting these criteria of success would improve citizen's quality of life, creating a stronger community within the city. Finally, the study provides relevant information for social researchers and urban planners by identifying factors that influence QOL perceptions and providing elements for political and academic debate.},

abstract = {Recognized as implementation actors of operative measures for transition towards a low carbon economy, cities must establish a development roadmap integrating local resources with local energy development plans. A systematic approach does not exist yet and cities develop their plans individually, which is difficult for small and medium sized cities due to limited development capacities. Conventional city planning approaches do not integrate considerations on energy, economy and environment in transition plans in an easily comparable way, yet making decisions with regards to these parameters is vital to determine outcomes of planned developments on future sustainability of the city. The paper presents a framework model based on emergy synthesis which integrates energy, economic and environmental city systems in the decision making process, examining associated theoretical challenges and application limitations. The method is applied on the city of Sisak in Croatia which has developed plans to implement several initiatives geared towards creating a smart energy city. The model enables simulation and assessment of impacts of individual projects targeting the development of a smart energy city on city sustainability expressed through emergy performance, used as a tool for evaluating local development alternatives within the boundary of local resources.},

While the importance of technology strategy has received more attention in recent years, few research studies have examined how roadmapping processes are used to explore the potential convergence of products and services that may be developed in the future. The aim of this paper is to introduce an integrated roadmapping process for services, devices and technologies capable of implementing a smart city development R&D project in Korea. The paper applies a QFD (Quality Function Deployment) method to establish interconnections between services and devices, and between devices and technologies. The method is illustrated by a detailed case study, which shows how different types of roadmap can be coordinated with each other to produce a clear representation of the technological changes and uncertainties associated with the strategic planning of complex innovations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Environmental and energy problems confronting South Korea brought a paradigm shift in the urban development toward "low-carbon green city" since the declaration of "Green Growth Strategy" in 2008. The South Korean governments set the goal to increase urban energy self-sufficiency through renewable energy generation and implemented various urban energy projects. However, the outcome of those urban green energy projects showed a varying degree of success. While the top-down approach led by the government facilitated the spread of urban green energy strategies in a short period of time, it also showed some drawbacks, such as the gap of willingness between the central government and the local governments and low level of community involvement. Although the importance of citizen participation in the transition to urban energy self-sufficiency has been emphasized in a rhetoric, energy projects that residents played a key role were rare in Korea. The urban energy transition in the low carbon green city projects needs to be supplemented by reinforced bottom-up approaches with the momentum from local governments as well as active citizen participation during the planning and implementation process.},

abstract = {This study proposes a new typological framework for classifying smart city services. Intentionally focused on citizen-centricity, away from bureaucratic perspectives that most typologies have taken, this typology is derived from marketing and service science literature. The proposed typology consists of four dimensions: mode of technology (automate-informative-transformative), purpose of service (hedonic-utilitarian), service authority (voluntary-mandatory), and delivery mode (passive-interactive). This typological framework is validated with a qualitative exercise of classifying inventories of actual smart city services in practice into the framework. Exercise results revealed that the categories provided are mutually exclusive and comprehensively exhaustive in general, and useful in further conceptualization of new services by identifying gaps in reality. In practice, this typology would be useful in positioning specific smart city service under development in terms of citizen-centricity. Urban planners and administrators may use this framework in understanding the pattern of their service development. Also, this framework may provide a useful guideline for service designer pinpointing the design characteristics of old and new smart city services from the perspective of users and customers of city services: citizens. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

We developed a framework for conducting case studies examining how smart cities were being implemented in San Francisco and Seoul Metropolitan City. The study's empirical results suggest that effective, sustainable smart cities emerge as a result of dynamic processes in which public and private sector actors coordinate their activities and resources on an open innovation platform. The different yet complementary linkages formed by these actors must further be aligned with respect to their developmental stage and embedded cultural and social capabilities. Our findings point to eight 'stylized facts', based on both quantitative and qualitative empirical results that underlie the facilitation of an effective smart city.

abstract = {International practice applies several urban indicators for sustainable cities (Monocle's Quality of Life Survey, Quality of Life Index (QLI), Indicators for Sustainability, European Green City Index, City Blueprint and others). These urban indicators can serve in performing integrated monitoring, assessing and recommending objectives sought by cities by different quantitative and qualitative aspects. Some of these tools can be applied to assessing a city's quality of life. One of the goals of this article is to compare several alternative methods for assessing a city's quality of life and their accuracies. A comparison was performed of the QLI and INVAR methods while conducting an analysis of comparable data from the 2012–2016 surveys on the Quality of Life in European Cities. Upon establishing the rankings of European cities by their quality of life with the assistance of the QLI and INVAR methods, an estimation of correspondence of results obtained by both methods and sensitivity analysis were performed based on a quantitative tool proposed in this paper. The obtained values of such criteria revealed a good level of congruity between the ranks obtained by employing both methods. The sensitivity analysis indicated that the results yielded by both the QLI and INVAR methods for rating the quality of life in European cities per the ever-fluctuating 2012–2016 data were similar. In other words, there was little difference between these methods for city ranking. This research also provides the INVAR method and its abilities to supplement the QLI with new functions: quantitative recommendations for cities under analysis by the indicators under analysis, optimization of indicators with consideration of indicators achieved in the quality of life area, and establishment of the values of the indicators under analysis permitting the city under analysis to raise its rating to the desired level.},

Some, like London, attract an excess of speculative, momentum or tax-informed inward investment to finance their intensification. Provincial towns, on the other hand, which sustain extractive metropolii, can wither without capital or talent. Sensible planning and calibrated regional investment is the antidote to polarisation but confronts an apparent 'smart' or 'sustainable' conundrum. Grandiose, technical megaprojects like Songdo or Masdar cities and sprawling, disconnected estates are an anathema. We articulate a putative smart and sustainable solution ('. smart-SUR') with 'institutional', 'project' and innovative 'funding' components and explore mega-urban regeneration projects in the UK and Holland. Smart-SUR has geographical, procedural and teleological aspects. Its mechanism involves local engagement, institutional strengthening, tight project screening and innovative regenerative funding. Its outcome are inclusive, measured, and coordinated transformations which 'sweat' existing assets, counter the long-tail of educational failure, and catalyse productive local innovation.},

abstract = {This article reports an exploratory investigation of individual perceptions of factors that underlie the use of collaborative electronic media (electronic mail, World Wide Web, list serves, and other collaborative systems) for sharing information in a large state university in Australia. The model builds on the Constant et al.'s theory of information sharing. We propose that perceptions of information culture, attitudes regarding information ownership and propensity to share, as well as task and personal factors influence people's use of collaborative media. We found that task characteristics (task interdependence), perceived information usefulness and the user's computer comfort were most strongly associated with the person's use of collaborative media. Consistent with Constant et al.'s earlier findings, views of information ownership and propensity to share were significantly related to use. Interestingly, use of electronic media for sharing information and contacting people was weakly associated with a more structured, closed information culture. This implies that heavy users and sharers want more structured information flow in place, possibly due to their need to have reliable access to other individual's knowledge and information. Contrary to suggestions in the literature, a fully open, organic information culture may not always be most desirable. Implications for knowledge managers, practitioners and researchers are suggested. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Furthermore, the paper aspires to help create a deeper understanding of the system in order to guide the implementation of similar models in other districts, creating more sustainable cities. The method has been to quantify the local mass and energy flows of the model, using the secondary energy generated within Hammarby Sj{\"{o}}stad as basis when creating the system boundaries of the calculations. The findings demonstrate that the Hammarby Model reduces the metabolic flows of Hammarby Sj{\"{o}}stad but that the district is far from self-sufficient in terms of secondary energy. The conclusions of the paper are that the development of integrated infrastructural systems is one way to help create more sustainable cities. However, in order to reduce metabolic flows even further, the efficiency of the system must be improved by integrating more renewable energy sources. At the same time less energy has to be used in the households. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {“Cleaner Production“(CP) is about less and more efficient energy and materials use and the substitution of more harmful products (for the environment and health) by less dangerous ones. CP was the reply of the industry to the call for sustainable development as launched by the WCED (1987) and further elaborated in Rio's Agenda 21 (UN, 1992). During the past 25 years, the concept was put in practice. During this period it changed in scope, methods, and application area. This provided a deeper socio-economic impact to an idea that was originally launched to awaken industry on its environmental responsibilities. This paper provides a review of essentials that contributed to the fundamental changes in CP during the most recent quarter of a century. It takes off with a review of CP definitions illustrating the changes of the content. Changes in scope are exemplified with the increasing importance of “Corporate Social Responsibility” (CSR). This includes that post-modern companies have not only responsibilities on their economic performance and the environment, but should also act on issues including human rights and resources, business ethics, and community involvement. The links between CP and green and circular economy are indicated. The CP approach is increasingly applied outside the industry. CP for sustainable tourism is discussed in more detail but is only an example of the wider application in e.g. agriculture or health services. This widening of contents necessitates more and better-adapted methods supporting the measurement of the CP components. Indicators, assessment strategies, and green accounting are increasingly improved and used more specifically and frequently. This evolution is discussed in a context of a dilution of the original environmental targets in a wider, more societal scope and the transition towards a more responsible, proactive and reliable management of the sectors applying CP.},

abstract = {Advocated mostly by technology companies, the smart city concept promises participation, democratization and innovative urbanism. Tracking these promises and ideas, this paper explores “smart urbanism” in ten cities from all over Israel. Based on interviews with leading figures in municipalities, smart city consultants and key figures in technological companies (n = 40), the aims of this paper are to assess the efforts of cities to become smart by responding to the following questions: 1. What is guiding the decision-making process in developing technological initiatives? 2. Does context play a role in implementing technological initiatives? 3. How are the residents perceived, and what tools are being used to address residents' digital differences? The key argument of this paper is threefold: first, in the process of becoming a smart city, the roles of public and private actors are blurred, influencing the process of decision making. Second, despite contextual differences, cities adopt similar digital initiatives. Third, technological initiatives that focus on social needs and address inequality in the digital age are still at the margins. The final discussion suggests that most municipalities are still at an early stage of digitization implementation and have the ability to shape and form a vision for the cities as socio-technological ecosystems in a way that will serve their publics as a whole. The paper ends with a call for shifting the focus from the city to society in developing digital initiatives and cultivating smart social urbanism.},

One perspective focuses on active discontent: citizens are dissatisfied with the technology, democratic process, and societal impact of the smart city and show different types of behavior to express their discontentment. The other perspective emphasizes passive discontent: citizen discontent does not manifest itself due to citizens' lack of awareness and skills and the absence of channels to express their discontentment. Both perspectives on discontent suggest different government responses respectively to overcome citizen discontent through ‘the right technologies', ‘the right rules', and ‘the right information', or to stimulate critical citizenship through ‘the right to smart city education and empowerment' and the ‘right to participate and challenge'.

It represents the first attempt to apply Amartya Sen's capability approach by exploring the implications of digital divides for promoting inclusive and climate-friendly cities that prioritize well-being, equity, and societal participation. Sen's framework recognizes individual variations in converting resources into valuable ‘functionings', and herein emphasizes the importance of aligning personal, social, and environmental conversion factors for individuals to fully navigate, participate in, and enjoy the benefits provided by smart cities. Adopting the capability approach and employing a cross-disciplinary analysis of the scientific literature, the primary objective is to broaden understanding of how to improve inclusivity and accessibility within smart-city societies, with a specific focus on marginalized community members facing first- and second-level digital divides. This paper underscores the importance of adopting a systemic perspective on climate-smart city navigation and stresses the importance of establishing a unified governing body responsible for monitoring, evaluating, and enhancing smart-city functionality. The paper concludes by summarizing some policy recommendations to boost social inclusion and address climate change in smart cities, such as creating capability-enhancing institutions, safeguarding redundancy in public-choice options, empowering citizens, and leveraging academic knowledge in smart-city policy formulation.},

abstract = {Smart City has been an emerging research domain for Government, Businesses, and researchers in the last few years. The Indian government is also interested and investing lots of funds to develop smart cities. These cities are technology-based and require interdisciplinary research and development for successful implementation. Over the last few decades, various technological interventions have created a tendency to provide smart everyday objects to make human life more comfortable. The emergence of the smart city paradigm is a response to creating a future city that guarantees the well-being and rights of its citizens from the perspective of industrial development: industry, urban planning, environment, and sustainable development. There are several subdomains in the smart city for the research. To work with the different subdomains in a smart city, proper guidance about the background of the smart city is required. This research paper is a guide for the same. This research paper represents a systematic literature review of the smart city domain. This paper carries out a systematic review of research papers published in various well-reputed journals like IEEE, Springer, Elsevier, etc., between 2011 and 2021. This paper will help the government, businesses, and researchers aiming to enhance the smart city concept. Initially, this paper discusses the origin and emergence of this concept, followed by a few definitions and characteristics with the real roadmap and primary supporting pillars of the smart city. This paper discusses a typical architecture having different layers like Sensing, Transportation, Data Management, and Application Layers. There are various supporting technologies and platforms for the smart city; hence implementations are impossible without these technologies and media. This research paper discusses different components of the smart city. A broad literature survey is being done to observe various challenges, opportunities, and future trends in the smart city. This research paper can guide the researchers and provide the research direction in the smart city domain.},

abstract = {Since the late 2000s, the city of Nairobi in Kenya has become a focal point of large-scale and ambitious technology-driven city making processes and ambitions. In this study, we draw upon observations, interviews, and policy analysis to examine processes of city making and the spread of ICT-driven infrastructures, juxtaposing ambitious visions of emergent plans with ordinary realities of the African city. We demonstrate that while processes of smart city making have strongly been inclined toward technocratic approaches and deterministic appeals, this inclination is highly deceptive. We argue that rather than being deterministic, these processes are essentially politicized, highly contested, and shaped by the role and impact of local practices and context-specific realities. In making this argument, we draw from a social studies of technology perspective which engages with the notion of technological determinism to make this contribution to the academic field of critical urbanism.},

abstract = {Highlights: What are the main findings? New smart cities have deepened social and digital inequalities among the technologically savvy residents and those who are usually left behind due to their age, lack of abilities, or resources. The reflective framework for inclusive smart cities offers a comprehensive and holistic approach from the perspective of who is included or excluded, what is the value of digital inclusion, and what are the key premises of inclusive digital governance. What is the implication of the main finding? The framework is meant to act as a starting point in the design of inclusive digital urban policies and strategies and can also be employed to assess the directions taken to date by city governments towards more inclusive practices. While cities on a global scale embrace smartness as a roadmap for efficient urban governance, disparities persist in the domain of digital accessibility, literacy, and skills, with manifestations of digital exclusion, ageism, and ableism prevalent in most digital urban experiences. Despite their commitment to bridging the digital divide, governments lack comprehensive frameworks to inform policymaking and action for inclusion in smart cities. This review paper aims to deepen the understanding of the multifaceted challenges confronting the governance of inclusion in smart cities. Drawing from a review of research encompassing digital inclusion, digital transitions, smart cities, and urban governance, we discuss who is included and excluded in the governance of smart cities; what are the necessary conditions to be met for smart cities to be considered inclusive; and how can smart city governance deliver public value and equal benefits for all. As a novel contribution, this paper outlines a reflective framework to inform citizen inclusion in the governance of smart cities. This framework is meant to act as a starting point in the design of inclusive digital urban policies, and can also be employed to assess the directions taken to date in public organizations towards more inclusive urban practices.},

During this crisis period, Australian universities continued to acknowledge in ritual ways their position on unceded (stolen) Aboriginal Country. Using ideas about generosity, vulnerability and thinking with care,the authors asks whether the provenance of Australian university real estate portfolios can be made good in any way, or whether one can rethink a sense of property and face the facts about the historic theft of land that makes tree-planting possible.},

In Vietnam, blockchain is applied in many aspects of life, such as finance, banking, business, commerce, e-commerce, tourism, education, and healthcare. Previously, blockchain was known as the origin of cryptocurrencies. However, in recent years, blockchain technology and its applications have gone far beyond cryptocurrencies. This study aimed to assess the current situation, development trends, opportunities, and challenges in applying blockchain in business and financial activities. The research analyzed the Vietnamese government's policies related to blockchain technology. In addition, the study updates the development trends of blockchain technology in business and financial activities through international scientific conferences, books, newspapers, and magazines. The study's findings indicate that Vietnam is a high potential market for developing blockchain technology. Also, Vietnam faces many opportunities and challenges in catching up with this trend, especially when Vietnam is implementing many policies to develop the digital economy. Therefore, thanks to assessing the current situation, development trends, opportunities, and challenges in Vietnam, the study helps to suggest some solutions for the difficulties in applying blockchain technology, especially the thirst for human resources in the blockchain industry.},

With the aid of an in-depth literature review, this study explores e-participation initiatives and their progress in strengthening the governance of South African municipalities. Using the content analysis technique, this study reveals that there is a serious lack of digital infrastructure and that digital gaps and lack of proper research addressing these problems between urban and rural municipalities contribute to inadequate Information and Communication Technology (ICT) strategies to improve citizen engagement and participation in governance processes. From this perspective, this study recommends an urgent need to under-take deliberate awareness campaigns to promote the use of e-participation platforms; and identify the citizens' needs and concerns to formulate locally preferred content and design inclusive policies to strengthen the order of local governance.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Beneficial effects include growth in real per capital income, income distribution via welfare transfer payments, and educational level. Detrimental effects include rapid economic growth and unemployment. The model is based on United States mortality rate data since 1909, classified by age. The validity of the model is sustained by empirical test based on multiple regression analysis.},

abstract = {The technological interventions in everyday processes has led to the rise of Smart ecosystems where all aspects of everyday life like governance, transportation, agriculture, logistics, maintenance, education and healthcare are automated in some way or the other and can be controlled, managed and accessed remotely with the help of smart devices. This has led to the concept of Smart cities where Information Communication and Technology (ICT) is merged with the existing traditional infrastructure of a city which is then coordinated and managed using digital technology. This idea of smart cities is slowly but surely coming into reality as many countries around the globe are adopting this idea and coming up with their own model of smart cities. At the core of smart city lies the sensors and actuators embedded in the smart devices that sense the environment for facilitating effective decision making. The microcontrollers available in these devices are programmed to take decisions automatically based on the information received from the sensors. This involves integration of several information and communication technologies like artificial intelligence, protocols, Internet of things (IoT), wireless sensor network (WSN) etc. This paper discusses and extensively reviews the role of enabling technologies in smart cities. The paper further highlights the challenges and limitations in the development of smart cities along with the mitigation strategies. Specifically, three categories of challenges are identified namely technical, socio-economic and environmental giving specifics of each category. Finally, some of the best practices for attaining sustainable smart cities are provided.},

abstract = {In Northern Nigeria a deteriorating health system has resulted in one of the World's highest rates of maternal and infant deaths. The dire situation in Northern Nigeria is only amplified by the lack of an effective health information system, leaving hospitals and clinics to make decisions about patient care with only uninformed guesses about medical history and access to unreliable and unintelligible patient registers and summary reports. In 2009 we implemented an electronic medical records system using OpenMRS for the Family Health Unit of the Shehu Idris College. The three-month process resulted in electronic forms for all clinical areas, greatly reduced data duplication and a monthly reporting process that takes minutes instead of days. This system provides not only access to the first patient-based health indicators in Nigeria (as opposed to previously error-prone aggregate data) but is also an example of the potential to overcome the harsh computing environment in Nigeria to implement eHealth systems that will improve the quality of patient care. {\textcopyright} 2010 IMIA and SAHIA.

abstract = {Technologically advanced world, digital technologies have become an integral part of our daily lives, shaping the way we communicate, work, learn, and access information. The internet, smartphones, and various digital tools have opened up countless opportunities, connecting people globally and transforming the way we interact with the world. However, not everyone has equal access to these digital technologies, leading to a phenomenon known as digital inequality. Digital inequality refers to the disparities in access to digital technologies and the resulting gaps in opportunities, resources, and information. It encompasses various dimensions, including geographical, socioeconomic, and racial/ethnic disparities. Unequal access to digital technologies can exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities, limiting individuals' potential, and hindering societal progress. Geographically, there are significant disparities between rural and urban areas, as well as between developing and developed countries. Rural areas often lack the necessary infrastructure and internet connectivity, making it challenging for residents to access digital resources and services. Similarly, developing countries face infrastructure limitations, making it difficult for their citizens to benefit from the digital revolution.},

abstract = {Historically, health care management information systems (MISs) focused primarily on finance and the transactions related to revenue cycle and supply management. Automating processes improved transaction time and accuracy, required fewer employees, and yielded a favorable "return on investment" (ROI). This functionality was available by "outsourcing" contracts, often to financial services companies or service bureaus using mainframe computers. The cost of onsite computer hardware, software, and the personnel to run them was, therefore, minimal. Eventually, as the cost of hardware dropped, as powerful minicomputers and microcomputers arrived, and as software became more "expert," many of these transactional tasks were brought in house. Functionality was added incrementally to automate such processes as patient registration, scheduling, admission, transfer, and discharge. Other "islands" and "best-of-breed" automation existed in areas such as laboratory services, radiology, and critical care units, but rarely did these systems talk to each other. Powerful environmental forces continue to forge tighter linkages between the financing and delivery of health care and accountability for outcomes. Refinements of MIS to realize even greater productivity gains in business operations and drive operating margin is imperative. Central to most MIS planning is a movement away from a paper-based medical record to a "computerized patient record" (CPR) or "electronic medical record" (EMR). The potential advantages of such a record are numerous. In most modem health care facilities, organization of MIS is moving to a more centralized model, away from smaller shops dedicated to data processing, computer services, medical records, and desktop support. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

It represents the first attempt to apply Amartya Sen's capability approach by exploring the implications of digital divides for promoting inclusive and climate-friendly cities that prioritize well-being, equity, and societal participation. Sen's framework recognizes individual variations in converting resources into valuable ‘functionings', and herein emphasizes the importance of aligning personal, social, and environmental conversion factors for individuals to fully navigate, participate in, and enjoy the benefits provided by smart cities. Adopting the capability approach and employing a cross-disciplinary analysis of the scientific literature, the primary objective is to broaden understanding of how to improve inclusivity and accessibility within smart-city societies, with a specific focus on marginalized community members facing first- and second-level digital divides. This paper underscores the importance of adopting a systemic perspective on climate-smart city navigation and stresses the importance of establishing a unified governing body responsible for monitoring, evaluating, and enhancing smart-city functionality. The paper concludes by summarizing some policy recommendations to boost social inclusion and address climate change in smart cities, such as creating capability-enhancing institutions, safeguarding redundancy in public-choice options, empowering citizens, and leveraging academic knowledge in smart-city policy formulation.},

The paper also illustrates future research directions, from both academic and practical points of view. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conduct a literature review on cyber risk and cyber risk insurance using a standardized search and identification process that has been used in various academic articles. Based upon this selection process, a database of 209 papers is created. The main research results findings are extracted and organized in seven clusters. Findings: The results illustrate the immense difficulties to insure cyber risk, especially due to a lack of data and modelling approaches, the risk of change and incalculable accumulation risks. The authors discuss various ways to overcome these insurability limitations, such as mandatory reporting requirements, pooling of data or public–private partnerships in which the government covers parts of the risk. Originality/value: Despite its increasing relevance for businesses at present, research on cyber risk is limited. Many papers can be found in the IT domain, but relatively little research has been done in the business and economics literature. The authors illustrate where research stands currently and outline directions for future research.},

abstract = {In recent years, the concept of smart sustainable cities has come to the fore. And it is rapidly gaining momentum and worldwide attention as a promising response to the challenge of urban sustainability. This pertains particularly to ecologically and technologically advanced nations. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the field of smart (and) sustainable cities in terms of its underlying foundations and assumptions, state–of–the art research and development, research opportunities and horizons, emerging scientific and technological trends, and future planning practices. As to the design strategy, the paper reviews existing sustainable city models and smart city approaches. Their strengths and weaknesses are discussed with particular emphasis being placed on the extent to which the former contributes to the goals of sustainable development and whether the latter incorporates these goals. To identify the related challenges, those models and approaches are evaluated and compared against each other in line with the notion of sustainability. The gaps in the research within the field of smart sustainable cities are identified in accordance with and beyond the research being proposed. As a result, an integrated approach is proposed based on an applied theoretical perspective to align the existing problems and solutions identification for future practices in the area of smart sustainable urban planning and development. As to the findings, the paper shows that critical issues remain unsettled, less explored, largely ignored, and theoretically underdeveloped for applied purposes concerning existing models of sustainable urban form as to their contribution to sustainability, among other things. It also reveals that numerous research opportunities are available and can be realized in the realm of smart sustainable cities. Our perspective on the topic in this regard is to develop a theoretically and practically convincing model of smart sustainable city or a framework for strategic smart sustainable urban development. This model or framework aims to address the key limitations, uncertainties, paradoxes, and fallacies pertaining to existing models of sustainable urban form—with support of ICT of the new wave of computing and the underlying big data and context–aware computing technologies and their advanced applications. We conclude that the applied theoretical inquiry into smart sustainable cities of the future is deemed of high pertinence and importance—given that the research in the field is still in its early stages, and that the subject matter draws upon contemporary and influential theories with practical applications. The comprehensive overview of and critique on existing work on smart (and) sustainable cities provide a valuable and seminal reference for researchers and practitioners in related research communities and the necessary material to inform these communities of the latest developments in the area of smart sustainable urban planning and development. In addition, the proposed holistic approach is believed to be the first of its kind. That is, it has not been, to the best of one's knowledge, investigated or produced elsewhere.},

abstract = {Valid measurement scales for predicting user acceptance of computers are in short supply. Most subjective measures used in practice are unvalidated, and their relationship to system usage is unknown. The present research develops and vandales new scales for two specific variables, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which are hypothesized to be fundamental determinants of user acceptance. Definitions for these two variables were used to develop scale items that were pretested for content validity and then tested for reliability and construct validity in two studies involving a total of 152 users and four application programs. The measures were refined and stream-lined, resulting in two six-item scales with reliabilities of .98 for usefulness and .94 for ease of use. The scales exhibited high convergent, discriminant, and factorial validity. Perceived usefulness was significantly correlated with both self-reported current usage (r=.63, Study 1) and self-predicted future usage (r=.85, Study 2). Perceived ease of use was also significantly correlated with current usage (r=.45, Study 1) and future usage (r=.59, Study 2). In both studies, usefulness had a significantly greater correlation with usage behavior than did ease of use. Regression analyses suggest that perceived ease of use may actually be a causal antecedent to perceived usefulness, as opposed toy a parallel, direct determinant of system usage. Implications are drawn for future research on user acceptance.},

abstract = {Several great features offered by wireless sensor networks (WSN) result in its wide deployment in various remote and continuous monitoring applications. As such, managing huge collected readings in this domain posted many challenges due to its design limitations. In order to provide seamless data transmission, which is of utmost importance in those delay-sensitive applications, minimum delay and packet loss occurrence should be considered. Specifically, this paper addresses the common issue of congested networks in WSN with the combination technique of variance-based distributed contention control (DCC-V) and packet size optimization. The proposed integration technique, which operates on medium access control layer, takes into consideration the packet size advantages as it plays a key role in determining successful data delivery, given the error-prone nature of WSN. While ensuring fewer corrupted packets, the proposed contention window (CW) in DCC-V minimizes the chances of packet collisions and so alleviates congestion. In this technique, CW is determined based on slot utilization and average collision values, which also involve standard deviation measurements. Simulation analysis using network simulator-2 shows outstanding performance of the proposed solution compared with the existing IEEE 802.15.4 protocol.},

abstract = {Even before the COVID-19 global pandemic, the world saw the adoption and proliferation of numerous digital tools and technologies, or a global digital transformation. This paved the way for digital inclusion, particularly through e-commerce and shared services platforms which helped to reduce barriers to entry and created abundant socio-economic opportunities across income groups. As a result, digital literacy becomes a vital aspect of modern life due to the rapid global shift toward this digital transformation. Numerous scholars have investigated the benefits of digital literacies since 1995. The primary objective of this paper is to investigate good practices and lessons learned on how digital literacy may serve as a policy instrument for social innovation and socio-economic transformations. The empirical approach is interpretive, through an understanding of digital literacy categorized into three primary pillars: (i) the evolution and foundational concepts of digital literacy, (ii) frameworks and measures of digital literacy, and (iii) the capacity and skills associated with digital literacy. The paper also examines how digital literacy capacity and skills shape social innovation initiatives in Singapore and the UAE, impacting the socio-economic transformation of individuals, families, and communities. Our interpretive approach from field observations and policy implementation, offers a multi-dimensional perspective on digital literacy research, and its socio-economic impact on people and communities. These insights can assist researchers new to this field to gain a more thorough understanding of digital literacy's broad ecosystem and its extensive impact on communities and nations as a key driver of socio-economic change.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

To ensure digital training programmes are adequately managed, a standardized data collection strategy is required to measure an internationally accepted Digital Literacy Index. This index must be defined by a dynamic definition of Digital Literacy responsive to the fluid needs of the digital economy. This requires the introduction of a G20 standard-setting body informing a nationally representative data collection strategy. Furthermore, the adopted standards which inform the data collection process must be cognizant of the evolving demands of employers. _________________________________________________________________________ Challenge Recent G20 communiques of 2015 and 2016 have made pronouncements on addressing the digital divide but have largely focused on infrastructure development, financial inclusion or digital trade.

Digital Literacy, as with general literacy, provides an individual with the capability to achieve other valued outputs in life, especially in the modern digital economy.

abstract = {In many developing countries, smart city initiatives are in their infancy. Like many other developing countries, smart projects in Morocco have been facing several challenges since their launch in 2016. The adoption of smart services requires the commitment and involvement of Moroccan citizens. This chapter focuses on a systematic literature review of the main studies dealing with factors that appear to improve end-user acceptance of services provided by Moroccan smart cities. A specific method known as PRISMA is being adopted to select and synthesize relevant studies in this field. The results obtained from the systematic review indicate that the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) is the most utilized theory in the literature. Additionally, the examination of existing studies has revealed that successful implementation of smart projects requires decision-makers to consider the following factors: performance expectancy, ease of use, social influence, perceived cost, awareness, trust in technology, and trust in the government.},

Therefore, using the semi-systematic review of news articles and blogs' in direct content analysis, we explore the cost of mobile money usage in the sub-region. We examine the state of mobile charges and how it potentially reverses the original purpose of FinTech. Results indicate that governments and other stakeholders find mobile money charges to be high. The imposition of mobile money tax and the regressive structure of mobile money charges affect the poor. The effort of policymakers to reduce the cost of mobile money in the sub-region is ineffective because the FinTech market is dominated by few foreign-owned telecommunication companies. Thus, the creation and promotion of a domestic FinTech market are necessary to promote greater financial inclusion.},

abstract = {Smart City has been an emerging research domain for Government, Businesses, and researchers in the last few years. The Indian government is also interested and investing lots of funds to develop smart cities. These cities are technology-based and require interdisciplinary research and development for successful implementation. Over the last few decades, various technological interventions have created a tendency to provide smart everyday objects to make human life more comfortable. The emergence of the smart city paradigm is a response to creating a future city that guarantees the well-being and rights of its citizens from the perspective of industrial development: industry, urban planning, environment, and sustainable development. There are several subdomains in the smart city for the research. To work with the different subdomains in a smart city, proper guidance about the background of the smart city is required. This research paper is a guide for the same. This research paper represents a systematic literature review of the smart city domain. This paper carries out a systematic review of research papers published in various well-reputed journals like IEEE, Springer, Elsevier, etc., between 2011 and 2021. This paper will help the government, businesses, and researchers aiming to enhance the smart city concept. Initially, this paper discusses the origin and emergence of this concept, followed by a few definitions and characteristics with the real roadmap and primary supporting pillars of the smart city. This paper discusses a typical architecture having different layers like Sensing, Transportation, Data Management, and Application Layers. There are various supporting technologies and platforms for the smart city; hence implementations are impossible without these technologies and media. This research paper discusses different components of the smart city. A broad literature survey is being done to observe various challenges, opportunities, and future trends in the smart city. This research paper can guide the researchers and provide the research direction in the smart city domain.},

Taking feedback from students at the end of the semester, however, has the disadvantage of not benefitting the students that have already taken the course. To benefit the current students, feedback should be given in real time and addressed in real time. This would enable students and lecturers to address teaching and learning issues in the most beneficial way for the students. Analysing students' feedback using sentiment analysis techniques can identify the students' positive or negative feelings, or even more refined emotions, that students have towards the current teaching. Feedback can be collected in a variety of ways, with previous research using student response systems such as clickers, SMS and mobile phones.

The empirical results show that ICT has a positive and statistically significant relationship with health, showing that the higher the levels of ICT, the higher the level ofhealth. There is also a bi - directional causality between ICT and health. This indicates that ICT spurs health which, in turn, boosts ICT usage even further. Moreover, health expenditure has significant positive effects, suggesting that the higher the scale of health expenditure, the higher the level of health. Unemployment rate has significant negative effects, meaning that the higher the level of unemployment, the lower the level of health. The level of education, measured by adult literacy rate, has significant positive effects, depicting that the higher the level of education, the higher the level of health. On the contrary, environmental pollution, measured by carbon dioxide emissions per capita, has significant negative effects, indicating that the higher the level of environmental pollution, the lower the level of health.Resumen alternativo:У cmammi дослужено взаемозв'яз&kappa;и та причинно-насл^&kappa;овий зв'язо&kappa; мж 1КТ та здоров'ям в Африщ за перюд 1995-2015 рр.

With its “security by design,” Blockchain (BC) can help in addressing major security requirements in IoT. BC capabilities like immutability, transparency, auditability, data encryption and operational resilience can help solve most architectural shortcomings of IoT. This article presents a comprehensive survey on BC and IoT integration. The objective of this paper is to analyze the current research trends on the usage of BC-related approaches and technologies in an IoT context. This paper presents the following novelties, with respect to related work: (i) it covers different application domains, organizing the available literature according to this categorization, (ii) it introduces two usage patterns, i.e., device manipulation and data management (open marketplace solution), and (iii) it reports on the development level of some of the presented solutions. We also analyze the main challenges faced by the research community in the smooth integration of BC and IoT, and point out the main open issues and future research directions. Last but not least, we also present a survey about novel uses of BC in the machine economy.},

Education is one of the sectors of interest in smart cities. Concurrently, the extensive academic literature on smart cities makes identifying the main areas of interest related to education, leading institutions and authors, potential interconnections between different disciplines, and existing gaps more complicated. This article maps the knowledge domain of education in smart cities through a bibliometric analysis to identify current trends, research networks, and topics of greatest interest. A total of 88 articles, published between 2000 and 2023, were examined using an interdisciplinary approach. The leading countries are mainly located in Europe and North America and include China. Bibliometrics provides an intellectual configuration of knowledge on education in smart cities; a co-word analysis identifies conceptual sub-domains in specific themes. In general, education within smart cities represents a universal challenge that requires a structured and interdisciplinary approach at all levels. Finally, this paper offers some suggestions for future research, adopting a more comprehensive view of the areas of investigation through a holistic analysis of stakeholders.},

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) find application in various fields like environmental monitoring, health-care, land security, and many more. To ease our day-to-day activity, WSNs have become an integral tool for complex data gathering tasks. Monitoring a phenomenon by a WSN depends on the collective data provided by the sensor nodes. To ensure reliable operation of WSNs, it is important to quantify the performance of such networks in terms of network reliability measures. This article studies the reliability of WSNs with multistate nodes and proposes an approach to evaluate the flow-oriented network reliability of WSNs consisting of multistate sensor nodes. The proposed method takes into account the dynamic state of the network due to multistate sensor nodes. The proposed approach includes enumeration of shortest minimal paths from application-specific flow satisfying sensor nodes (source nodes) to the sink node. It then proposes a modified sum-of-disjoint products approach to evaluate WSN reliability in the presence of multistate nodes from the enumerated shortest minimal paths. Simulations are performed on WSNs of various sizes to show the applicability of the proposed approach on arbitrary WSNs.},

With the average cyber insurance claim rising from USD 145,000 in 2019 to USD 359,000 in 2020, there is a growing necessity for better cyber information sources, standardised databases, mandatory reporting and public awareness. This research analyses the extant academic and industry literature on cybersecurity and cyber risk management with a particular focus on data availability. From a preliminary search resulting in 5219 cyber peer-reviewed studies, the application of the systematic methodology resulted in 79 unique datasets. We posit that the lack of available data on cyber risk poses a serious problem for stakeholders seeking to tackle this issue. In particular, we identify a lacuna in open databases that undermine collective endeavours to better manage this set of risks. The resulting data evaluation and categorisation will support cybersecurity researchers and the insurance industry in their efforts to comprehend, metricise and manage cyber risks.},

abstract = {Long before you create a research proposal, let alone conduct your research, you need to identify a problem to address and then a question or questions to ask regarding your targeted problem. This chapter first discusses the nature of a research problem, where you might get ideas for a problem to investigate, narrowing down or focusing on a particular problem to address, and writing good research questions. It then discusses finding literature that is relevant to and helpful in clarifying your targeted problem and question(s). 21 In this chapter, the reader will understand the characteristics of a research problem or phenomenon. ✦ understand the characteristics of good research questions. ✦ clarify the difference between a research problem and hypothesis. ✦ understand the purposes of a literature review.},

abstract = {This study presents the first results of an analysis primarily based on semi-structured interviews with government officials and managers who are responsible for smart city initiatives in four North American cities-Philadelphia and Seattle in the United States, Quebec City in Canada, and Mexico City in Mexico. With the reference to the Smart City Initiatives Framework that we suggested in our previous research, this study aims to build a new understanding of smart city initiatives. Main findings are categorized into eight aspects including technology, management and organization, policy context, governance, people and communities, economy, built infrastructure, and natural environment. {\textcopyright} 2012 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract = {The introduction of the Information and Communication Technologies throughout the last decades has created a trend of providing daily objects with smartness, aiming to make human life more comfortable. The paradigm of Smart Cities arises as a response to the goal of creating the city of the future, where (1) the well-being and rights of their citizens are guaranteed, (2) industry and (3) urban planning is assessed from an environmental and sustainable viewpoint. Smart Cities still face some challenges in their implementation, but gradually more research projects of Smart Cities are funded and executed. Moreover, cities from all around the globe are implementing Smart City features to improve services or the quality of life of their citizens. Through this article, (1) we go through various definitions of Smart Cities in the literature, (2) we review the technologies and methodologies used nowadays, (3) we summarise the different domains of applications where these technologies and methodologies are applied (e.g. health and education), (4) we show the cities that have integrated the Smart City paradigm in their daily functioning and (5) we provide a review of the open research challenges. Finally, we discuss about the future opportunities for Smart Cities and the issues that must be tackled in order to move towards the cities of the future.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Large events and gatherings, particularly those taking place indoors, have been linked to multitransmission events that have accelerated the pandemic spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To provide real-time, geolocalized risk information, we developed an interactive online dashboard that estimates the risk that at least one individual with SARS-CoV-2 is present in gatherings of different sizes in the United States. The website combines documented case reports at the county level with ascertainment bias information obtained via population-wide serological surveys to estimate real-time circulating, per-capita infection rates. These rates are updated daily as a means to visualize the risk associated with gatherings, including county maps and state-level plots. The website provides data-driven information to help individuals and policy makers make prudent decisions (for example, increasing mask-wearing compliance and avoiding larger gatherings) that could help control the spread of SARS-CoV-2, particularly in hard-hit regions.},

abstract = {This paper aims to emphasize the need for enhancing inclusivity and accessibility within smart-city societies. It represents the first attempt to apply Amartya Sen's capability approach by exploring the implications of digital divides for promoting inclusive and climate-friendly cities that prioritize well-being, equity, and societal participation. Sen's framework recognizes individual variations in converting resources into valuable ‘functionings', and herein emphasizes the importance of aligning personal, social, and environmental conversion factors for individuals to fully navigate, participate in, and enjoy the benefits provided by smart cities. Adopting the capability approach and employing a cross-disciplinary analysis of the scientific literature, the primary objective is to broaden understanding of how to improve inclusivity and accessibility within smart-city societies, with a specific focus on marginalized community members facing first- and second-level digital divides. This paper underscores the importance of adopting a systemic perspective on climate-smart city navigation and stresses the importance of establishing a unified governing body responsible for monitoring, evaluating, and enhancing smart-city functionality. The paper concludes by summarizing some policy recommendations to boost social inclusion and address climate change in smart cities, such as creating capability-enhancing institutions, safeguarding redundancy in public-choice options, empowering citizens, and leveraging academic knowledge in smart-city policy formulation.},

abstract = {This study delves into the pivotal role that indicators play in designing, assessing, and guiding policies for sustainable urban development. Indicators, encompassing both quantitative and qualitative measures, serve as essential tools in evaluating efforts toward sustainable development, providing a practical and objective means of understanding the complex urban environment. The lack of a robust database is identified as a hindrance to monitoring sustainable development progress, underscoring the importance of comprehensive indicators. The study employs a bibliometric literature review methodology, focusing on smart city and sustainability indicators (SSCI) from 2015 to 2022. A total of 818 articles were narrowed down to 191 through rigorous criteria. The study showcases a growing interest in this field, with the number of articles published experiencing a remarkable 288% increase from 2015 to 2022. China emerges as a focal point, leading in both article production and citations, emphasizing its commitment to sustainable development and smart city initiatives. The keywords "sustainable development", "sustainability" and “urban development” had the most occurrences in text analysis. We found three different clusters with k-means analysis, and the circular economy indicators were the most representative category. In conclusion, the study underscores the holistic vision of SSCI in the current scenario, balancing technology and sustainability to improve urban quality of life while safeguarding the planet. Encouraging further research into integrating resilience-focused indicators and innovative solutions is crucial for enhancing sustainable urban development and informing policy decisions.},

The book illustrates how urban innovation is being negotiated and interpreted in a wide range of contexts, while also raising more fundamental questions about the rapidly evolving relationship between society and information and communication technologies (ICT). It describes how smart urbanisation in Newcastle, Australia involves the slow and incremental roll-out of technologies to supplement existing local government agendas. The book utilizes the metaphor of Frankenstein to characterise the hybrid landscape created by the laissez-faire property development system in Hong Kong. It provides insights on how smart is being implemented in the ‘ordinary' Chinese city of Wuhan, and argues that ICT innovation has shed its novelty and emerged as a commonplace activity of urban development. The book also provides a detailed analysis of the contested collaborations within the Munich municipal government and with its corporate partner, Siemens.},

abstract = {Today's world is highly network interconnected owing to the pervasiveness of small personal devices (e.g., smartphones) as well as large computing devices or services (e.g., cloud computing or online banking), and thereby each passing minute millions of data bytes are being generated, processed, exchanged, shared, and utilized to yield outcomes in specific applications. Thus, securing the data, machines (devices), and user's privacy in cyberspace has become an utmost concern for individuals, business organizations, and national governments. In recent years, machine learning (ML) has been widely employed in cybersecurity, for example, intrusion or malware detection and biometric-based user authentication. However, ML algorithms are vulnerable to attacks both in the training and testing phases, which usually leads to remarkable performance decreases and security breaches. Comparatively, limited studies have been conducted to understand the essence and degree of the vulnerabilities of ML techniques against security threats and their defensive mechanisms. It is imperative to systematize recent works related to cybersecurity using ML to seek the attention of researchers, scientists, and engineers. Therefore, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the works that have been carried out most recently (from 2013 to 2018) on ML in cybersecurity, describing the basics of cyber-attacks and corresponding defenses, the basics of the most commonly used ML algorithms, and proposed ML and data mining schemes for cybersecurity in terms of features, dimensionality reduction, and classification/detection techniques. In this context, this article also provides an overview of adversarial ML, including the security characteristics of deep learning methods. Finally, open issues and challenges in cybersecurity are highlighted and potential future research directions are discussed.},

abstract = {The role of technology and importance of access to high-speed broadband has become glaringly obvious during the COVID-19 pandemic. High-speed Internet is a tool people rely upon to conduct the daily business of their life and interact with each other, the economy, and government. However, millions of people in the USA still have no home access to high-speed Internet. Low-income, people of color, older, Native Americans, and rural residents in particular are on the wrong side of the digital divide. This structural reality perpetuates social, economic, and political disparities. Consistent with a social work human rights approach, the United Nations General Assembly declared access to the Internet a basic human right in 2016. This calls upon social workers to engage in advocacy efforts to advance policy and programs to alleviate the digital divide. In this article, we examine the digital divide in the USA and discuss why it is a social justice and human rights issue. We provide a policy context and recent examples of state or local policy initiatives to reduce the digital divide. Prominent among them is California's Internet for All Now Act. We also identify and share promising practices and advocacy tools being used in the field that provide guidance to community practitioners as they engage in work at state and local levels aimed at closing the digital divide.},

A smart city can monitor the physical world in real time, and provide intelligent services to both local residents and travelers in terms of transportation, healthcare, environment, entertainment, and energy. However, security and privacy concerns arise, since smart city applications not only collect a wide range of privacy-sensitive information from people and their social circles, but also control city facilities and influence people's lives. In this article, we investigate security and privacy in smart city applications. Specifically, we first introduce promising smart city applications and architecture. Then we discuss several security and privacy challenges in these applications. Some research efforts are subsequently presented to address these security and privacy challenges for intelligent healthcare, transportation, and smart energy. Finally, we point out some open issues for future research.},

abstract = {The transition towards greater smartness is an emerging trend in the development of modern cities. This transition manifests itself in the widespread adoption of information and communication technologies (ICTs), cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), and other technological tools aimed at improving the level of city smartness. Although numerous studies have focused on the smart city (SC) phenomenon, knowledge about empirical criteria that can be used to define a city as “smart” and to measure the degree of a city's “smartness” remains limited. The present study aims to bridge this knowledge gap by a systematic literature review of recent studies, in which various empirical criteria are used for SC identification. The study helps to identify a total of 48 SC identification metrics, which are further split into three main categories—smart digital technology, living conditions, and environmental (ecological) sustainability. Among these groups of criteria, the “smart digital technology” group of metrics appears to be the most popular, while criteria pertinent to “ecological sustainability” are applied considerably less often. As the study also reveals, only about half of the criteria used by empirical studies for SC identification actually relate to urban residents' needs, with the rest being general technological measures. Therefore, for a balanced SC assessment, we suggest a ranking system based on the nine most important metrics, which equally represent all the main aspects of the SC phenomenon while placing an emphasis on the improvement of the quality of life of local residents. The proposed system is applied to several major cities across the globe to demonstrate its use and usefulness.},

abstract = {Energy efficiency has been a hot research topic for many years and many routing algorithms have been proposed to improve energy efficiency and to prolong lifetime for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Since nodes close to the sink usually need to consume more energy to forward data of its neighbours to sink, they will exhaust energy more quickly. These nodes are called hot spot nodes and we call this phenomenon hot spot problem. In this paper, an Enhanced Power Efficient Gathering in Sensor Information Systems (EPEGASIS) algorithm is proposed to alleviate the hot spots problem from four aspects. Firstly, optimal communication distance is determined to reduce the energy consumption during transmission. Then threshold value is set to protect the dying nodes and mobile sink technology is used to balance the energy consumption among nodes. Next, the node can adjust its communication range according to its distance to the sink node. Finally, extensive experiments have been performed to show that our proposed EPEGASIS performs better in terms of lifetime, energy consumption, and network latency.},

abstract = {Purpose: Nigeria has the highest burden of breast cancer (BC) in Africa. While the survival rates for BC are over 90% in many high-income countries; low-and middle-income countries like Nigeria have 40% BC survival rates. Prior studies show that the burden and poor BC survival rates are exacerbated by both health system and individual level factors, yet there is a paucity of literature on the experiences of BC survivors in Nigeria. Hence, this study explored the divergent and convergent experiences of BC survivors in accessing, navigating, and coping with treatment. Methods: Participants (N = 24, aged 35 to 73 years) were recruited and engaged in focus group discussions (group 1, n = 11; group 2, n = 13 participants). Transcripts were transcribed verbatim and analyzed with inductive thematic analysis. Results: Four themes were identified: “I am carrying this [breast cancer] alone,” “Living my life,” “‘God' helped me,” and “A very painful journey.” Participants described how they concealed their BC diagnosis from family and significant others while accessing and navigating BC treatment. Also, they adopted spiritual beliefs as a coping mechanism while sticking to their treatment and acknowledging the burden of BC on their well-being. Conclusions: Our findings explored the emotional burden of BC diagnosis and treatment and the willingness of the BC survivors to find meaning in their diagnosis. Treatment for BC survivors should integrate supportive care and innovative BC access tools to reduce pain and mitigate the burdens of BC. Implications for cancer survivors: The integration of innovative technologies for venous access and other treatment needs of BC is crucial and will improve survivorship. Non-disclosure of BC diagnosis is personal and complicated; hence, BC survivors need to be supported at various levels of care and treatment to make meaningful decisions. To improve survivorship, patient engagement is crucial in shared decision-making, collaboration, and active participation in care.},

In many societies, digital literacy already determines individuals' possibilities to effectively function as a part of society: everyday life actions such as accessing health services and using public transport are dependent on digital literacy. However, this is just one level of the ongoing transformation. More broadly, digital technology is deeply woven into everyday practices, social interactions, cultural experiences, economic transactions, and political decision-making (Manovich 2013; Williamson 2014). This results in that digital literacy, understood mainly as a set of adequate skills that help in navigating digitalized everyday environments, needs to be accompanied by notions of broader critical awareness of technologies' role in society. In this chapter, we explore one facet of this critical awareness: how the notion of digital citizenship could be complemented and expanded to include an ability to imagine alternative future trajectories .},

Though the significance of literature reviews has never been in doubt, researchers, especially novice researchers, still struggle with developing effective strategies for reviewing literature. An important reason for this difficulty is the rapidly increasing number of potentially relevant publications—not all of which necessarily add value to a literature review. As such, avoiding standing on the shoulders of dwarfs literature search emerges as a major issue in crafting an effective literature review. In this paper, we discuss challenges of literature searches in the increasingly dynamic context of information systems (IS) research and make recommendations for how to deal with them.

We demonstrate that while processes of smart city making have strongly been inclined toward technocratic approaches and deterministic appeals, this inclination is highly deceptive. We argue that rather than being deterministic, these processes are essentially politicized, highly contested, and shaped by the role and impact of local practices and context-specific realities. In making this argument, we draw from a social studies of technology perspective which engages with the notion of technological determinism to make this contribution to the academic field of critical urbanism.},

abstract = {Unlicensed driving remains a serious problem in many jurisdictions, and while it does not play a direct causative role in road crashes, it undermines driver licensing systems and is linked to other high risk driving behaviours. Roadside licence check surveys represent the most direct means of estimating the prevalence of unlicensed driving. The current study involved the Queensland Police Service (QPS) checking the licences of 3,112 drivers intercepted at random breath testing operations across Queensland between February and April 2010. Data was matched with official licensing records from Transport and Main Roads (TMR) via the drivers' licence number. In total, 2,914 (93.6%) records were matched, with the majority of the 198 unmatched cases representing international or interstate licence holders (n = 156), leaving 42 unknown cases. Among the drivers intercepted at the roadside, 20 (0.6%) were identified as being unlicensed at the time, while a further 11 (0.4%) were driving unaccompanied on a Learner Licence. However, the examination of TMR licensing records revealed that an additional 9 individuals (0.3%) had a current licence sanction but were not identified as unlicensed by QPS. Thus, in total 29 of the drivers were unlicensed at the time, representing 0.9% of all the drivers intercepted and 1% of those for whom their licence records could be checked. This is considerably lower than the involvement of unlicensed drivers in fatal and serious injury crashes in Queensland, which is consistent with other research confirming the increased crash risk of the group. However, the number of unmatched records suggest that it is possible the on-road survey may have under-estimated the prevalence of unlicensed driving, so further development of the survey method is recommended.},

From societal causes to the impact of everyday actions, The Digital Disconnect explores the relationship between digital and social inequalities, and the lived consequences of digitisation. Ellen Helsper goes beyond questions of digital divides and who is connected. She asks why and how social and digital inequalities are linked and shows the tangible outcomes of socio-digital inequalities in everyday lives. The book: Introduces the key theories and concepts needed to understand both ‘traditional' and digital inequalities research. Investigates a range of socio-digital inequalities, from digital access and skills, to civic participation, social engagement, and everyday content creation and consumption. Brings research to life with a range of qualitative vignettes, drawing out the personal experiences that lay at the heart of global socio-digital inequalities. The Digital Disconnect is an expert exploration of contemporary theory, research and practice in socio-digital inequalities. It is also an urgent and impassioned call to broaden horizons, expand theoretical and methodological toolkits, and work collectively to help achieve a fairer digital future for all. Ellen J.

This study—based on an online survey among a representative sample of the Dutch population—indicates that the first-level digital divide remains a problem in one of the richest and most technologically advanced countries in the world. By extending basic physical access combined with material access, the study finds that a diversity in access to devices and peripherals, device-related opportunities, and the ongoing expenses required to maintain the hardware, software, and subscriptions affect existing inequalities related to Internet skills, uses, and outcomes.},

abstract = {The history of environmental education reveals a close connection between changing concerns about the environment and its associated problems and the way in which environmental education is defined and promoted. In the 1990s, mounting concern over environment and development problems has meant greater support for an educational approach, which not only considers immediate environmental improvement as an actual goal, but also addresses educating for ‘sustainability' in the long term. Although some education literature has embraced this new focus of environmental education for sustainability (EEFS), it has failed to outline the essence of this approach and has neglected questions about how it differs from the environmental education of the 1980s. No document exists to date which translates the goals of EEFS into guiding principles for its development in schools. Essentially, EEFS needs further definition. This paper is an attempt to engage the debate about what constitutes this new focus of environmental education and how it may differ from conventional approaches to environmental education. {\textcopyright} 1995, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

In addition, multi-input multi-output (MIMO) technique and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique with multiantenna also enable the network to serve more users. In this paper, we study the maximization of energy efficiency (EE) problem in THz-NOMA-MIMO systems for the first time. And the original optimization problem is divided into user clustering and hybrid precoding. Based on channel correlation characteristics, a fast convergence scheme for user clustering using enhanced K-means machine learning algorithm is proposed. Considering the power consumption and complexity, the hybrid precoding scheme based on the sub-connection structure is adopted. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve faster convergence and higher EE.},

High-speed Internet is a tool people rely upon to conduct the daily business of their life and interact with each other, the economy, and government. However, millions of people in the USA still have no home access to high-speed Internet. Low-income, people of color, older, Native Americans, and rural residents in particular are on the wrong side of the digital divide. This structural reality perpetuates social, economic, and political disparities. Consistent with a social work human rights approach, the United Nations General Assembly declared access to the Internet a basic human right in 2016. This calls upon social workers to engage in advocacy efforts to advance policy and programs to alleviate the digital divide. In this article, we examine the digital divide in the USA and discuss why it is a social justice and human rights issue. We provide a policy context and recent examples of state or local policy initiatives to reduce the digital divide. Prominent among them is California's Internet for All Now Act. We also identify and share promising practices and advocacy tools being used in the field that provide guidance to community practitioners as they engage in work at state and local levels aimed at closing the digital divide.},

This interdisciplinary theoretical formulation details our evidence-based interpretation of how smart city transitions should be conceptualized and enacted in order to overcome the oversimplification fallacy resulting from corporate discourses on smart urbanism. By offering a broad and realistic understanding of smart city transitions, the proposed theory combines different smart-city-related concepts in a model which attempts to expose what causal mechanisms surface in sustainable smart city transitions and to guide empirical inquiry in smart city research. Together with all the authors contributing to this book, our objective is to give smart city research more robust scientific foundations and to generate theoretical propositions upon which subsequent large-scale empirical testing can be conducted. With the proposed middle-range theory, different empirical settings can be investigated by using the same analytical elements, facilitating the cross-case analysis and synthesis of the systematic research efforts which are progressively contributing to shedding light on the assemblage of sustainable smart city transitions.},

abstract = {Purpose: To address the growing pressure to foster effectiveness, sustainability and quality of life, local governments have focused on developing policies and initiatives designed to make their cities smarter. Despite the growing attention paid to this issue, an important but under-investigated issue is represented by the smart city governance. In this regard, in light of the claimed need for collaboration, the purpose of this paper is to investigate why and how different institutional works carried out by multiple actors may explain the way in which collaborative governance can be constructed in the context of a smart city. Design/methodology/approach: A rich in-depth case study has been carried out exploring the experience of a smart city in the north of Italy. The study explores the institutional works done by multiple actors (Lawrence et al., 2013) and their influence on the governance of the smart city. Findings: Collaboration is perceived to be instrumental in making a city smart, during the design and implementation phase, while generating new challenges that must be overcome by an integration of the political, technical and, especially, cultural work of the collective actors involved. Originality/value: Despite governance is recognized as a crucial factor for realizing a smartness-orientation, it is scarcely investigated. The main value of the current research is thus its contribution to overcome this gap providing new empirical evidence on the role of multiple actors in the smart city context.},

Banks hold a unique intermediary role in sustainable development, but also have a difficult position after the 2008 financial crisis. This paper aims to explore business models for sustainability in the service industry, particularly banking. It explores the receptiveness of customers towards sustainable business models pursued by banks. The retail banking industry in Hong Kong is the focus of this work. First, a practice review and semi-structured interviews are used to develop and validate a set of sustainable business model archetypes for the banking industry. Second, surveys are conducted to test customer receptiveness for the archetypes. Eight sustainable business model archetypes for banking are developed and validated. “Substitute with digital processes” “adopt a stewardship role” and “encourage sufficiency” are most welcomed by customers. Some archetypes seem at direct odds with current business practice, such as “encourage sufficiency”. This study gives an insight to how to “do good and do well” in the banking industry. Further research on the attributes of these archetypes can be conducted to gain a deeper understanding why customers prefer banks to use these archetypes.},

@article{Oza2017,
abstract = {Background: Stringent infection control requirements at Ebola treatment centers (ETCs), which are specialized facilities for isolating and treating Ebola patients, create substantial challenges for recording and reviewing patient information. During the 2014-2016 West African Ebola epidemic, paper-based data collection systems at ETCs compromised the quality, quantity, and confidentiality of patient data. Electronic health record (EHR) systems have the potential to address such problems, with benefits for patient care, surveillance, and research. However, no suitable software was available for deployment when large-scale ETCs opened as the epidemic escalated in 2014. Objective: We present our work on rapidly developing and deploying OpenMRS-Ebola, an EHR system for the Kerry Town ETC in Sierra Leone. We describe our experience, lessons learned, and recommendations for future health emergencies. Methods: We used the OpenMRS platform and Agile software development approaches to build OpenMRS-Ebola. Key features of our work included daily communications between the development team and ground-based operations team, iterative processes, and phased development and implementation. We made design decisions based on the restrictions of the ETC environment and regular user feedback. To evaluate the system, we conducted predeployment user questionnaires and compared the EHR records with duplicate paper records. Results: We successfully built OpenMRS-Ebola, a modular stand-alone EHR system with a tablet-based application for infectious patient wards and a desktop-based application for noninfectious areas. OpenMRS-Ebola supports patient tracking (registration, bed allocation, and discharge); recording of vital signs and symptoms; medication and intravenous fluid ordering and monitoring; laboratory results; clinician notes; and data export. It displays relevant patient information to clinicians in infectious and noninfectious zones. We implemented phase 1 (patient tracking; drug ordering and monitoring) after 2.5 months of full-time development. OpenMRS-Ebola was used for 112 patient registrations, 569 prescription orders, and 971 medication administration recordings. We were unable to fully implement phases 2 and 3 as the ETC closed because of a decrease in new Ebola cases. The phase 1 evaluation suggested that OpenMRS-Ebola worked well in the context of the rollout, and the user feedback was positive. Conclusions: To our knowledge, OpenMRS-Ebola is the most comprehensive adaptable clinical EHR built for a low-resource setting health emergency. It is designed to address the main challenges of data collection in highly infectious environments that require robust infection prevention and control measures and it is interoperable with other electronic health systems. Although we built and deployed OpenMRS-Ebola more rapidly than typical software, our work highlights the challenges of having to develop an appropriate system during an emergency rather than being able to rapidly adapt an existing one. Lessons learned from this and previous emergencies should be used to ensure that a set of well-designed, easy-to-use, pretested health software is ready for quick deployment in future.},

It ensures operational efficacy, information sharing with the public and enhances the quality of government service and promotes the welfare of citizen, by using the information and communication technology. The main aim of a smart city is to optimize the different functions of the city, like improving the life class of inhabitants, through digital and smart technologies. This chapter highlights the different technologies and models, in the process of forming smart cities. Introduction to the smart city is presented in the first section. The different technologies are explained in the second section. Various models, framed for the smart city, are dealt with in the third section. Finally, the major applications of a smart city are described in the fourth section. Purpose: The purpose of the chapter is to explore the introduction to smart city and the different categories of smart city technologies and models. Furthermore, the key applications of smart city technologies in the different domains are focused on through different subsections. Methodology: In this chapter, the fundamental, area and components of smart city technology are presented in the first section. The different categories of smart city technologies are dealt with in the second section. The different smart city models are discussed in the third section. Finally, the precise and decisive applications of smart city technologies are explained in the fourth section.

abstract = {People and companies move money with every financial transaction they make. We aim to understand how such activity gives rise to large-scale patterns of monetary flow. In this work, we trace the movement of e-money through the accounts of a mobile money system using the provider's own transaction records. The resulting transaction sequences---balance-respecting trajectories---are data objects that represent observed monetary flows. Common sequential motifs correspond to known use-cases of mobile money: digital payments, digital transfers, and money storage. We find that each activity creates a distinct network structure within the system, and we uncover coordinated gaming of the mobile money provider's commission schedule. Moreover, we find that e-money passes through the system in anywhere from minutes to months. This pronounced heterogeneity, even within the same use-case, can inform the modeling of turnover in money supply. Our methodology relates economic activity at the transaction level to large-scale patterns of monetary flow, broadening the scope of empirical study about the network and temporal structure of the economy.},

abstract = {Here we sketch the rudiments of what constitutes a smart city which we define as a city in which ICT is merged with traditional infrastructures, coordinated and integrated using new digital technologies. We first sketch our vision defining seven goals which concern: developing a new understanding of urban problems; effective and feasible ways to coordinate urban technologies; models and methods for using urban data across spatial and temporal scales; developing new technologies for communication and dissemination; developing new forms of urban governance and organisation; defining critical problems relating to cities, transport, and energy; and identifying risk, uncertainty, and hazards in the smart city. To this, we add six research challenges: to relate the infrastructure of smart cities to their operational functioning and planning through management, control and optimisation; to explore the notion of the city as a laboratory for innovation; to provide portfolios of urban simulation which inform future designs; to develop technologies that ensure equity, fairness and realise a better quality of city life; to develop technologies that ensure informed participation and create shared knowledge for democratic city governance; and to ensure greater and more effective mobility and access to opportunities for urban populations.We begin by defining the state of the art, explaining the science of smart cities. We define six scenarios based on new cities badging themselves as smart, older cities regenerating themselves as smart, the development of science parks, tech cities, and technopoles focused on high technologies, the development of urban services using contemporary ICT, the use of ICT to develop new urban intelligence functions, and the development of online and mobile forms of participation. Seven project areas are then proposed: Integrated Databases for the Smart City, Sensing, Networking and the Impact of New Social Media, Modelling Network Performance, Mobility and Travel Behaviour, Modelling Urban Land Use, Transport and Economic Interactions, Modelling Urban Transactional Activities in Labour and Housing Markets, Decision Support as Urban Intelligence, Participatory Governance and Planning Structures for the Smart City. Finally we anticipate the paradigm shifts that will occur in this research and define a series of key demonstrators which we believe are important to progressing a science of smart cities.{\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.},

abstract = {We use survey data conducted in 11 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2011 to analyze how the availability of physical infrastructure influences adoption of mobile phones and usage of mobile services. The availability of physical service infrastructure is approximated by data on nighttime light intensity in the areas in which survey respondents reside. After controlling for a number of individual and household characteristics including disposable income, we find that adoption of mobile phones is higher in areas with better physical infrastructure. However, mobile phone users who live in areas with poor infrastructure are more likely to rely on mobile phones to make financial transactions than individuals living in areas with better infrastructure. On the other hand, the use of mobile phones to access services such as email, skype, social media networks and Internet browsing is not dependent on the availability of physical infrastructure. Our results support the notion that mobile phones improve the livelihood of individuals residing in remote areas by providing them with access to financial services which are otherwise not available physically.},

abstract = {The increasingly unprecedented incidents (e.g. COVID-19) have made the contemporary supply chains more vulnerable to divergent risks and disruptions. Encouragingly, the recent trend of digital transformation, adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies (I4Ts), could significantly improve business processes extenuating potential risks and disruptions. Yet, there is a paucity of quantitative studies on the risk or disruption mitigation and I4Ts, specifically on agri-food industry. Using a sample of 302 firms from the Australian agri-food supply chains, we explore if the firms that adopt I4Ts experience the different impact of operational risks (supply-demand mismatch, financial and transportation) compared to others. The findings unveil that albeit such risks can significantly undermine firm performance, their negative effect is non-significant for the firms that adopt I4Ts compared to those that do not adopt. We thus suggest digital transformation as an effective way to extenuate operational risks and disruptions amid unanticipated events like COVID-19. Numerous contributions to theory and practice, plus United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (1 & 2) have been discussed.},

abstract = {Highlights: What are the main findings? New smart cities have deepened social and digital inequalities among the technologically savvy residents and those who are usually left behind due to their age, lack of abilities, or resources. The reflective framework for inclusive smart cities offers a comprehensive and holistic approach from the perspective of who is included or excluded, what is the value of digital inclusion, and what are the key premises of inclusive digital governance. What is the implication of the main finding? The framework is meant to act as a starting point in the design of inclusive digital urban policies and strategies and can also be employed to assess the directions taken to date by city governments towards more inclusive practices. While cities on a global scale embrace smartness as a roadmap for efficient urban governance, disparities persist in the domain of digital accessibility, literacy, and skills, with manifestations of digital exclusion, ageism, and ableism prevalent in most digital urban experiences. Despite their commitment to bridging the digital divide, governments lack comprehensive frameworks to inform policymaking and action for inclusion in smart cities. This review paper aims to deepen the understanding of the multifaceted challenges confronting the governance of inclusion in smart cities. Drawing from a review of research encompassing digital inclusion, digital transitions, smart cities, and urban governance, we discuss who is included and excluded in the governance of smart cities; what are the necessary conditions to be met for smart cities to be considered inclusive; and how can smart city governance deliver public value and equal benefits for all. As a novel contribution, this paper outlines a reflective framework to inform citizen inclusion in the governance of smart cities. This framework is meant to act as a starting point in the design of inclusive digital urban policies, and can also be employed to assess the directions taken to date in public organizations towards more inclusive urban practices.},

The selection of smart city verticals (or areas of focus for smart city programs) within processes of urban governance has implications for which aspects of the urban agenda become prioritized. Through a study of seven UK smart cities, the paper investigates the framing of city problems, selection of smart verticals, and decision-making logics. The findings highlight that the selection of smart city verticals within the case study cities is rooted in four key considerations: challenges in service delivery, pragmatism, entrepreneurialism, and broader national and global events and policy agendas. These considerations transcend different spatial scales and governance arrangements, raising questions around democratic accountability and transparency. The study concludes that caution is warranted when framing smart cities as a solution to city problems.},

abstract = {Objective: This study aims to develop and validate an evaluation framework to ensure the safety and reliability of mental health chatbots, which are increasingly popular due to their accessibility, human-like interactions, and context-aware support. Materials and Methods: We created an evaluation framework with 100 benchmark questions and ideal responses, and five guideline questions for chatbot responses. This framework, validated by mental health experts, was tested on a GPT-3.5-turbo-based chatbot. Automated evaluation methods explored included large language model (LLM)-based scoring, an agentic approach using real-time data, and embedding models to compare chatbot responses against ground truth standards. Results: The results highlight the importance of guidelines and ground truth for improving LLM evaluation accuracy. The agentic method, dynamically accessing reliable information, demonstrated the best alignment with human assessments. Adherence to a standardized, expert-validated framework significantly enhanced chatbot response safety and reliability. Discussion: Our findings emphasize the need for comprehensive, expert-tailored safety evaluation metrics for mental health chatbots. While LLMs have significant potential, careful implementation is necessary to mitigate risks. The superior performance of the agentic approach underscores the importance of real-time data access in enhancing chatbot reliability. Conclusion: The study validated an evaluation framework for mental health chatbots, proving its effectiveness in improving safety and reliability. Future work should extend evaluations to accuracy, bias, empathy, and privacy to ensure holistic assessment and responsible integration into healthcare. Standardized evaluations will build trust among users and professionals, facilitating broader adoption and improved mental health support through technology.},

High-speed Internet is a tool people rely upon to conduct the daily business of their life and interact with each other, the economy, and government. However, millions of people in the USA still have no home access to high-speed Internet. Low-income, people of color, older, Native Americans, and rural residents in particular are on the wrong side of the digital divide. This structural reality perpetuates social, economic, and political disparities. Consistent with a social work human rights approach, the United Nations General Assembly declared access to the Internet a basic human right in 2016. This calls upon social workers to engage in advocacy efforts to advance policy and programs to alleviate the digital divide. In this article, we examine the digital divide in the USA and discuss why it is a social justice and human rights issue. We provide a policy context and recent examples of state or local policy initiatives to reduce the digital divide. Prominent among them is California's Internet for All Now Act. We also identify and share promising practices and advocacy tools being used in the field that provide guidance to community practitioners as they engage in work at state and local levels aimed at closing the digital divide.},

abstract = {We investigate the physical-layer security of a wireless sensor network comprised of a source-destination pair, multiple decode-and-forward (DF) relays, and an eavesdropper. When the relays forward the source signal to the destination, they should dissipate certain power for driving their physical circuits (e.g., amplifiers and filters), in addition to the transmit power required for emitting radio signals. However, no existing work considers the circuit power when exploiting relays for enhancing the wireless security against eavesdropping. We thus propose the relay-selection based cooperative beamforming framework, where partial relays are selected to forward the source signal in a beamforming manner. We present two relay-selection strategies, namely, the exponential-complexity exhaustive search and linear-complexity relay ordering. For comparison purposes, we also evaluate the conventional all-relay based and best-relay based beamforming schemes, where all relays or only the best one is selected to assist the source-destination transmission. It is shown that the proposed beamforming schemes significantly outperform the conventional all-relay and best-relay based beamforming schemes in terms of secrecy capacity. Additionally, the relay-ordering based beamforming scheme almost achieves the same secrecy capacity as the exhaustive-search method, but with a reduced computational complexity.},

Motivated by this, we have presented a comprehensive survey on secure telesurgery systems comprising healthcare, surgical robots, traditional telesurgery systems, and the role of artificial intelligence to deal with the numerous security attacks associated with the patients' health data. Furthermore, we propose a blockchain and federated learning-based secure telesurgery system to secure the communication between patient and surgeon. The results of the proposed system are better than those of the traditional system in terms of improved latency, low data storage cost, and enhanced data offloading. Finally, we explore the research challenges and issues associated with the telesurgery system.},

abstract = {Smart city initiatives have the potential to address many contemporary urban challenges, utilizing information and technology. Increasingly, smart cities are considered as social innovation processes to achieve sustainable and inclusive urban development, being influenced by broader socio-economic and institutional contexts of cities. This paper explores ‘smart city transitions' across varied urban contexts, in particular, how smart city transitions are enacted and how they contribute to inclusive urban transformation and public value. Using a multiple case studies approach, the research investigated infrastructure planning practices in Amsterdam in the Netherlands, Seoul in Korea, Portland in the U.S. and Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) in Vietnam, cities that were known for strong efforts to establish integrated platforms to enhance societal benefits. Our analysis showed that each city has addressed its goals around sustainability, equity and affordability by reinforcing the engagement of multiple actors with the support of integrated platforms that facilitate open and multi-directional information flow in a transparent manner. In Amsterdam, innovative solutions for sustainable use of resources have been invented and distributed through multi-level social networks, contributing to the transformation into a circular economy. In Seoul and HCMC, the city's persistent efforts to utilize an open and integrated platform resulted in proactive engagement and collaboration of public and private actors in improving quality, equity and efficiency of transit services. Portland has tackled inequitable access and mistrust issues by setting principles for data governance and facilitating equity in the adoption of innovative technologies. Our research revealed that four cities established different forms of integrated platforms such as a centrally-controlled platform and a community-centred platform in order to address specific socio-economic issues within an institutional setting of each city. We concluded that building an integrated platform is not easy, but it is a critical prerequisite for the process of sustainable transformation to truly achieve smart cities across the globe.},

abstract = {In recent years, the concept of smart sustainable cities has come to the fore. And it is rapidly gaining momentum and worldwide attention as a promising response to the challenge of urban sustainability. This pertains particularly to ecologically and technologically advanced nations. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the field of smart (and) sustainable cities in terms of its underlying foundations and assumptions, state–of–the art research and development, research opportunities and horizons, emerging scientific and technological trends, and future planning practices. As to the design strategy, the paper reviews existing sustainable city models and smart city approaches. Their strengths and weaknesses are discussed with particular emphasis being placed on the extent to which the former contributes to the goals of sustainable development and whether the latter incorporates these goals. To identify the related challenges, those models and approaches are evaluated and compared against each other in line with the notion of sustainability. The gaps in the research within the field of smart sustainable cities are identified in accordance with and beyond the research being proposed. As a result, an integrated approach is proposed based on an applied theoretical perspective to align the existing problems and solutions identification for future practices in the area of smart sustainable urban planning and development. As to the findings, the paper shows that critical issues remain unsettled, less explored, largely ignored, and theoretically underdeveloped for applied purposes concerning existing models of sustainable urban form as to their contribution to sustainability, among other things. It also reveals that numerous research opportunities are available and can be realized in the realm of smart sustainable cities. Our perspective on the topic in this regard is to develop a theoretically and practically convincing model of smart sustainable city or a framework for strategic smart sustainable urban development. This model or framework aims to address the key limitations, uncertainties, paradoxes, and fallacies pertaining to existing models of sustainable urban form—with support of ICT of the new wave of computing and the underlying big data and context–aware computing technologies and their advanced applications. We conclude that the applied theoretical inquiry into smart sustainable cities of the future is deemed of high pertinence and importance—given that the research in the field is still in its early stages, and that the subject matter draws upon contemporary and influential theories with practical applications. The comprehensive overview of and critique on existing work on smart (and) sustainable cities provide a valuable and seminal reference for researchers and practitioners in related research communities and the necessary material to inform these communities of the latest developments in the area of smart sustainable urban planning and development. In addition, the proposed holistic approach is believed to be the first of its kind. That is, it has not been, to the best of one's knowledge, investigated or produced elsewhere.},

abstract = {Learning objectives To recognise the characteristics of millennial kids. To understand the contemporary nature of a digital divide. To make connections between the digital divide and social inclusion. To think about curriculums and pedagogical reforms that flow from the use of new technologies that support digital and social inclusion for families from low socioeconomic areas. Introduction When the digital divide was first conceptualised (Gore 1998) it focused on the ‘haves' and ‘have nots' with regard to having access to computer technology or not. While access remains a contentious issue it is readily apparent that the focus eventually shifted to the quality of access to the internet via dial-up or broadband. This was because those who had access via dial-up had their actions considerably restricted by the poorer quality of the connection while those on broadband had a broader range of possibilities available to them, resulting in a new divide. Today, while access is not universal, it needs to be considered in terms of the quality of the activities that being connected to the internet via a computer, or any device, affords as well as the expectations that teachers have of their students in these new learning contexts. In contemporary times digital engagement and social inclusion are important issues of concern in globalised contexts. This chapter argues that discussions of equity and social inclusion need to consider qualitatively different types of use of new technologies. It asserts that pedagogies concerned with socially disadvantaged students need to recognise that there are qualitatively different types of activities that can be conducted with new media and support students to become fluent in all of them and not just those that fulfil the criteria for access. This means taking a new approach and creating contexts for teaching and learning that value the life experiences of students and support them to encounter, and have success with, higher levels of sophisticated activities that are respectful of their needs and interests.},

abstract = {When ICTs (Information and Communications Technologies) are combined with healthcare, they can make a key contribution to gradually improve national health outcomes. The global outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 further highlighted the important role of e-Health and m-Health service modes. This research structures a mediated effect model to explore dynamic relationships between ICT factors, ICT impacts, and national health outcomes, among which ICT factors are independent variables; ICT impacts are mediating variables, and national health outcome indicators selected from United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and World Development Indicators are dependent variables. The fixed effect model is used to process a set of 141 countries' panel data from 2012 to 2016 from World Bank and World Economic Forum, while the classical three-step test method and Sobel test combined with fixed effects are used to test the mediated effects of the panel data. The results show that there are significant associations between ICT factors and national health outcome indicators, while only some of the partial mediated effects are proved. ICT environment and ICT usage can influence both the under-five mortality rate and adolescent fertility rate via ICT social impact. However, the mediated effect of ICT social impact on maternal mortality ratio and life expectancy at birth has not been confirmed. Meanwhile, the mediated effect of ICT economic impact has not been proven. This research is an interdisciplinary research in the field of information and communication technology and public health and reveals the path and mechanism whereby ICT factors improve national health outcomes, which can help global policymakers drive the next phase of the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and continue to improve the overall health at the national level.},

abstract = {Purpose: The increased adoption of internet-enabled phones in Africa has caused much speculation and optimism concerning its effects on financial inclusion. Policymakers, the media and various studies have all flaunted the potentials of internet and mobile phones for financial inclusion. An important question therefore is “Can the internet and mobile phones spur the inclusion of the financially excluded poor? This study therefore aims to examine the relationship and causality between internet, mobile phones and financial inclusion in Africa for the 2000-2016 period. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical analysis followed these three steps: examination of the stationarity of the variables; testing for the cointegration; and evaluation of the effects of the internet and mobile phones on financial inclusion in Africa for the 2000-2016 period using three outcomes of panel FMOLS approach and Granger causality tests. Findings: The empirical evidence shows that internet and mobile phones have significant positive relationship with financial inclusion, meaning that rising levels of internet and mobile phones are associated with increased financial inclusion. There is also uni-directional causality from internet and mobile phones to financial inclusion, implying that internet and mobile phones cause financial inclusion. The study also shows that macroeconomic factors such as capital formation, primary enrollment, bank credit, broad money, population growth, remittances, agriculture and interest rate, as well as institutional factors such as regulatory quality are important underlying factors for financial inclusion in Africa. Originality/value: In the literature, there is a dearth of research on the internet, mobile phones and financial inclusion, especially in Africa. Most of the related studies are conceptual and micro-based, with little empirical attention to the relationship and causality between internet, mobile phones and financial inclusion. In fact, this dearth of rigorous empirical studies has been attributed as the main cause of inadequate policy guidance in enhancing information communication technologies (Roycroft and Anantho, 2003), despite saturation levels in developed economies. This study fills the gap by evaluating the effects of the Internet and mobile phones on financial inclusion for 44 African countries for the 2000-2016 period.},

abstract = {One of the most important issues in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is severe energy restrictions. As the performance of Sensor Networks is strongly dependence to the network lifetime, researchers seek a way to use node energy supply effectively and increasing network lifetime. As a consequence, it is crucial to use routing algorithms result in decrease energy consumption and better bandwidth utilization. The purpose of this paper is to increase Wireless Sensor Networks lifetime using LEACH-algorithm. So before clustering Network environment, it is divided into two virtual layers (using distance between sensor nodes and base station) and then regarding to sensors position in each of two layers, residual energy of sensor and distance from base station is used in clustering. In this article, we compare proposed algorithm with well-known LEACH and ELEACH algorithms in homogenous environment (with equal energy for all sensors) and heterogeneous one (energy of half of sensors get doubled), also for static and dynamic situation of base station. Results show that our proposed algorithm delivers improved performance.},

This paper aims to clarify the meaning of the word “smart” in the context of cities through an approach based on an in-depth literature review of relevant studies as well as official documents of international institutions. It also identifies the main dimensions and elements characterizing a smart city. The different metrics of urban smartness are reviewed to show the need for a shared definition of what constitutes a smart city, what are its features, and how it performs in comparison to traditional cities. Furthermore, performance measures and initiatives in a few smart cities are identified.},

abstract = {The data-driven approach to sustainable urban development is becoming increasingly popular among the cities across the world. This is due to cities' attention in supporting smart and sustainable urbanism practices. In an era of digitalization of urban services and processes, which is upon us, platform urbanism is becoming a fundamental tool to support smart urban governance, and helping in the formation of a new version of cities—i.e., City 4.0. This new version utilizes urban dashboards and platforms in its operations and management tasks of its complex urban metabolism. These intelligent systems help in maintaining the robustness of our cities, integrating various sensors (e.g., internet-of-things) and big data analysis technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence) with the aim of optimizing urban infrastructures and services (e.g., water, waste, energy), and turning the urban system into a smart one. The study generates insights from the sensor city best practices by placing some of renowned projects, implemented by Huawei, Cisco, Google, Ericsson, Microsoft, and Alibaba, under the microscope. The investigation findings reveal that the sensor city approach: (a) Has the potential to increase the smartness and sustainability level of cities; (b) Manages to engage citizens and companies in the process of planning, monitoring and analyzing urban processes; (c) Raises awareness on the local environmental, social and economic issues, and; (d) Provides a novel city blueprint for urban administrators, managers and planners. Nonetheless, the use of advanced technologies—e.g., real-time monitoring stations, cloud computing, surveillance cameras—poses a multitude of challenges related to: (a) Quality of the data used; (b) Level of protection of traditional and cybernetic urban security; (c) Necessary integration between the various urban infrastructure, and; (d) Ability to transform feedback from stakeholders into innovative urban policies.},

The development is usually associated with several challenges and negative effects. This study relies on revealing ICTs challenges by firstly conducting a comprehensive literature review to identify the challenges that are most associated with ICTs. Then, a questionnaire survey was distributed among the Saudi population to study their expectations, perceptions, and concerns on the smart city concept and services. The questionnaire also investigated ICTs challenges identified from the literature review, including information security risks, privacy violation, incompatibility, and digital skill gaps. Consequently, semi-structured interviews were conducted to perceive the reasons for the incompatibility between different systems and digital skill gaps between the public. The findings show that the most likely challenges are information security risks and privacy violations, which are due to the increase in vulnerability, potential attacks, and lack of public awareness regarding personal data protection. The incompatibility between different systems and services in smart cities arouses worries among the public due to the expected high cost and difficulty of adaptation and utilization. Moreover, digital skill gaps arises between members of the population that have a low education level or are elderly persons.},

The key role of standards is technically to ensure quality, safety, reliability of constructions as stated the relevant codes. With the construction industry growing very fast, the purpose of this study was to investigate on the application of Rwanda building standards, with regards to the existing code requirements and to identify the relevant gaps. The study was conducted based on initially set specific objectives, while the research methodology was mainly comprised of visits to different public and private agencies related to construction industry, observations on the sites and interview with different experts. The study established that Rwanda building standards were still accused of a low awareness and application as well as noticeable gaps. The level of awareness among all professionals was still at 71%. In general about application, only 55% of respondents confirmed the experience in application of Rwanda building standards, even if this level was higher for some categories. A good part of respondents composing around 57% thought that Rwanda building standards documents were still incomplete. Based on the above findings, adequate strategies for improving the awareness, application process and document completion were proposed; with the introduction of Rwanda building standards into academic curriculum, increase the number of awareness meetings and recognition of adequate research before design or review of any standard, among others.Keywords: Building code, Building Standards, awareness strategy, Law and Regulations, Monitoring process},

Traditional power management usually requires two DC-DC converters, each for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and voltage regulation functionalities. The proposed circuit requires only one DC-DC converter for both the MPPT and voltage regulation. The EAI also provides a means to voltage regulation. This allows the circuit to have higher efficiency as the energy transfer does not have to go through two stages to reach the load. A PEH connected to the proposed circuit was tested under various vibration conditions. The circuit was found to have end-to-end efficiency of about 66% under most of the test conditions.},

abstract = {We review the academic literature on “cyber risk” and “cyber insurance” in the fields of business (management, economics, finance, risk management and insurance) and actuarial science. Our results show that cyber risk is an increasingly important research topic in many disciplines, but one that so far has received little attention in business and actuarial science. Business research has documented the manifold detrimental effects of cyber risks using event studies and scenario analyses, while economic research is especially concerned with trade-offs between different risk management activities. Quantitative research including papers published in actuarial journals mainly focuses on loss modelling, especially taking dependencies and network structure into account. We categorize the empirical literature on cyber risk to filter out what we know on the frequency, severity and dependence structure of cyber risk. Finally, we list open research questions which demonstrate that cyber risk research is still in its infancy and that there is ample room for future research.},

abstract = {Background: Most developing countries, including Uganda, have embraced the use of e-Health and m-Health applications as a means to improve primary healthcare delivery and public health for their populace. In Uganda, the growth in the information and communications technology industry has benefited the rural communities and also created opportunities for new innovations, and their application into healthcare has reported positive results, especially in the areas of disease control and prevention through disease surveillance. However, most are mere proof-of-concepts, only demonstrated in use within a small context and lack sustainability. This study reviews the literature to understand e-Health's current implementation status within Uganda and documents the barriers and opportunities to sustainable e-Health intervention programmes in Uganda. Methods: A structured literature review of e-Health in Uganda was undertaken between May and December 2015 and was complemented with hand searching and a document review of grey literature in the form of policy documents and reports obtained online or from the Ministry of Health's Resource Centre. Results: The searches identified a total of 293 resources of which 48 articles met the inclusion criteria of being in English and describing e-Health implementation in Uganda. These were included in the study and were examined in detail. Conclusion: Uganda has trialled several e-Health and m-Health solutions to address healthcare challenges. Most were donor funded, operated in silos and lacked sustainability. Various barriers have been identified. Evidence has shown that e-Health implementations in Uganda have lacked prior planning stages that the literature notes as essential, for example strategy and need readiness assessment. Future research should address these shortcomings prior to introduction of e-Health innovations.},

abstract = {The digital revolution has resulted in innovative solutions and technologies that can support the well-being, independence, and health of seniors. Yet, the notion of the 'digital divide' presents significant inequities in terms of who accesses and benefits from the digital landscape. To better understand the social and structural inequities of the digital divide, a realist synthesis was conducted to inform theoretical understandings of information and communication technologies (ICTs); to understand the practicalities of access and use inequities; to uncover practices that facilitate digital literacy and participation; and to recommend policies to mitigate the digital divide. A systematic search yielded 55 articles published between 2006 and 2016. Synthesis of existing knowledge, combined with user-experience elicited through a deliberative dialogue session with community stakeholders (n = 35), made visible a pattern of privilege that determined individual agency in ICT access and use. Though age is consistently centralized as the key determinant of the digital divide, our analyses, which encompassed both van Dijk's resources and appropriation theory and intersectionality, appraised this notion and revealed that age is not the sole determinant. Findings highlight the role of other factors that contribute to digital inequity among community-dwelling middle-aged (45-64) and older (65+) adults, including education, income, gender, and generational status. Informed by results of a realist synthesis that was guided by intersectional perspectives, a conceptual framework was developed outlining implications for theory, policy, and practice to address the wicked problem that is the digital divide.},

abstract = {Due to the open nature of the wireless communication in an Internet of Things (IoT) network, transmitted messages are easy to eavesdrop. To address the eavesdropping attack, we consider an IoT-based smart home where an IoT device (IoT-D) is selected as a friendly jammer to send artificial noise (AN) to protect transmitted messages from being eavesdropped. However, the selected IoT-D may send partial (or even none) AN, which is called an untrusted jammer. To avoid selecting an untrusted jammer, we aim to design two quantitative models from the perspective of time and space to evaluate the trustworthiness of IoT-Ds. Firstly, we adopt an improved energy detector to better counter signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) fluctuation of AN detection. Secondly, based on the detection results, we adopt two trust models: (1) the spatial-oriented beta trust model, (2) the time-oriented hidden Markov model (HMM)-based trust model. In the first model, direct and indirect trust of an IoT-D are both calculated to obtain an integrated trust value. In the second model, the probability of trusted state is calculated as the trust value, and time intervals between detection results of an IoT-D are taken into consideration. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the performance of our improved energy detection method and two trust models.},

Unlike the wireline networks, the unique characteristics of mobile ad hoc networks pose a number of nontrivial challenges to security design, such as open peer-to-peer network architecture, shared wireless medium, stringent resource constraints, and highly dynamic network topology. These challenges clearly make a case for building multifence security solutions that achieve both broad protection and desirable network performance. In this article we focus on the fundamental security problem of protecting the multihop network connectivity between mobile nodes in a MANET. We identify the security issues related to this problem, discuss the challenges to security design, and review the state-of-the-art security proposals that protect the MANET link- and network-layer operations of delivering packets over the multihop wireless channel. The complete security solution should span both layers, and encompass all three security components of prevention, detection, and reaction.},

A sample of hospitals located in Klang Valley, an area that surrounds the capital of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur were contacted in order to seek their perspectives in this matter. A questionnaire survey was used to gather the data and descriptive analysis was performed to analyze the data. The results show that only small number of participating hospitals have telemedicine applications and suggest that many of Malaysians hospitals are not yet ready for the application. Feasibility evaluation based on four factors: operational, time, economic and technical criteria. The study finds that operational and technical component of feasibility factors are more important than time and economic dimension. The ability to attract customers and opportunity to acquire latest infrastructure and skills justify the need of telemedicine in hospital. Successful implementation of telemedicine is related to the availability of three factors: strong fundamental knowledge and infrastructure, planning and management of health information and technology and fulfillment of legal and ethical issues and constant evaluation of telemedicine implementation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Asian Network for Scientific Information.},

abstract = {Purpose: To address the growing pressure to foster effectiveness, sustainability and quality of life, local governments have focused on developing policies and initiatives designed to make their cities smarter. Despite the growing attention paid to this issue, an important but under-investigated issue is represented by the smart city governance. In this regard, in light of the claimed need for collaboration, the purpose of this paper is to investigate why and how different institutional works carried out by multiple actors may explain the way in which collaborative governance can be constructed in the context of a smart city. Design/methodology/approach: A rich in-depth case study has been carried out exploring the experience of a smart city in the north of Italy. The study explores the institutional works done by multiple actors (Lawrence et al., 2013) and their influence on the governance of the smart city. Findings: Collaboration is perceived to be instrumental in making a city smart, during the design and implementation phase, while generating new challenges that must be overcome by an integration of the political, technical and, especially, cultural work of the collective actors involved. Originality/value: Despite governance is recognized as a crucial factor for realizing a smartness-orientation, it is scarcely investigated. The main value of the current research is thus its contribution to overcome this gap providing new empirical evidence on the role of multiple actors in the smart city context.},

The following skills are investigated: technical, information, communication, collaboration, critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills. To understand differences in the level of these skills among workers, we need to know the factors that determine an individual's skill level. A systematic literature review was conducted to provide a comprehensive overview of empirical studies measuring skill determinants. The results show that there is strong need for research on determinants of communication and collaboration skills. In a digital context, determinants for creativity and critical thinking are hardly studied. Furthermore, the identified determinants of 21st-century skills studies are limited to personality and psychological determinants, neglecting, for example, social determinants such as social support. Although digital skills studies show more variety, they mostly cover demographic and socioeconomic determinants.},

The establishment of Smart City initiatives in African cities is meant to improve the quality of lives of the residents of those cities. Information and communications technologies (ICT) are key enabling factors for this transformation and must be integrated into several functional domains of society, such as health, education, transportation, energy, etc., so as to engender efficient and ubiquitous public services, as well as higher socio-economic standards of living for the citizens. This paper highlights the potential benefits, as well as challenges, African cities embarking on Smart City initiatives face. To further grasp the motivations and challenges of implementing Smart City initiatives in Africa, we take a look at a new Smart City initiative (The SmartCity Innovation Hub, by Smart City Resort plc.) that is underway in the city of Lagos, Nigeria. We questioned the developers on their motivations for undertaking such a Smart City initiative in Africa, the potential economic, technological and environmental benefits of the project, and the challenges of embarking on such a project.},

abstract = {The sensor nodes deployed in wireless sensor networks are extremely power constrained, so maximizing the lifetime of the entire networks is mainly considered in the design. An energy efficient clustering algorithm with optimum parameters is designed for reducing the energy consumption and prolonging the system lifetime. An analytical clustering model with one-hop distance and clustering angle is given. The optimum one-hop distance and clustering angle are formulated by minimizing the energy consumption between inter-cluster and intra-cluster. Furthermore, the continuous working mechanism of each cluster head which acts as the local control center and will not be replaced by the candidate cluster head until its continuous working times reach the optimum values is given, and the optimum continuous working times of each cluster head can be obtained through the optimum one-hop distance and the clustering angle. With the mechanism, the frequency of updating cluster head and the energy consumption for establishing new cluster head can be reduced. The simulation results demonstrate that the clustering algorithm can effectively reduce the energy consumption and increase the system lifetime. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

abstract = {A smart city aims to become a citizen-centered city where citizens actively engage in urban operation and share urban data within a high-tech ICT infrastructure. It premises ‘smart citizens' who can understand and utilize digital technology to adapt well to the various infrastructure of smart cities. In reality, however, not only tech-savvy citizens but those who are not likely to coexist in a smart city. Disadvantaged groups with relatively insufficient awareness and the necessity of technologies might be excluded from smart cities' various benefits. The smart city innovations need to encompass diverse social groups' engagements to claim their legitimacy and sustainability from a long-term perspective. In this light, this study examines the potential digital divide in the advanced technologies used in the emerging 5G smart city era. Using survey data, we investigate if the smart citizens' social and technical readiness in terms of the use experience and necessity of new technologies can predict the adoption and use of the emerging 5G smart city innovations. The empirical results from this study can inform the digital divide between the general public and technology-disadvantaged groups. The findings can also guide policymakers in prioritizing technologies that are accessible and beneficial to all potential residents of smart cities in the future. Finally, the results yield specific policy implications for practitioners who design more inclusive and sustainable smart cities in the 5G era.},

IDS software keeps an eye out for malicious activity on a single computer or a network of computers. It is becoming increasingly important to detect intrusions and prevent them. Several methods to avoid or find intrusion in a network have been proposed in the past. However, the majority of the IDS detection methods currently in use are ineffective at solving this issue. Accuracy is the key factor in how well an intrusion detection system performs. In recent works, various techniques have been employed to enhance performance. In addition to this, machine learning (ML) has been used in many applications to produce results that are accurate in the relevant field. Determining how machine learning and data mining can be used to detect IDS in a network in the near future is the focus of this work. This literature review focuses on ML and data mining (DM) techniques for cyber analytics to support intrusion detection.},

abstract = {When ICTs (Information and Communications Technologies) are combined with healthcare, they can make a key contribution to gradually improve national health outcomes. The global outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 further highlighted the important role of e-Health and m-Health service modes. This research structures a mediated effect model to explore dynamic relationships between ICT factors, ICT impacts, and national health outcomes, among which ICT factors are independent variables; ICT impacts are mediating variables, and national health outcome indicators selected from United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and World Development Indicators are dependent variables. The fixed effect model is used to process a set of 141 countries' panel data from 2012 to 2016 from World Bank and World Economic Forum, while the classical three-step test method and Sobel test combined with fixed effects are used to test the mediated effects of the panel data. The results show that there are significant associations between ICT factors and national health outcome indicators, while only some of the partial mediated effects are proved. ICT environment and ICT usage can influence both the under-five mortality rate and adolescent fertility rate via ICT social impact. However, the mediated effect of ICT social impact on maternal mortality ratio and life expectancy at birth has not been confirmed. Meanwhile, the mediated effect of ICT economic impact has not been proven. This research is an interdisciplinary research in the field of information and communication technology and public health and reveals the path and mechanism whereby ICT factors improve national health outcomes, which can help global policymakers drive the next phase of the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and continue to improve the overall health at the national level.},

Indeed, clustering suffers from the adverse effects of isolated nodes in the network and some coverage problems. To deal with these issues, we present LEATCH-L, a Low Energy Adaptive Tier Clustering Hierarchy for Large scale WSNs. The proposed approach makes the major functions of LEACH applicable to large-scale WSNs whose dimension is much larger than the largest transmission radius of the sensor nodes. The latter imposes a dynamic decomposable structure on the network topology which results in a set of smaller subnetworks. Such decompositions are implemented through a smart m-level hierarchical clustering process. Moreover, the proposed approach involves a two level data aggregation. Evaluation results show that the introduced approach is scalable with significantly much better performance than the state-of-the art approaches.},

abstract = {To support an effective diffusion of innovations (DOI) in sustainable development (SD) projects, this paper presents a research-based integrative model to illustrate the factors leading the process of diffusion of innovation to succeed or fail in sustainable development projects. The proposed integrative model is based on diffusion of innovation principles founded in the research of Everett Rodgers that emphasizes the process of an effective innovation diffusion. Special emphasis is placed on determining not only the success factors for adequate innovation diffusion, but also on enabling a successful adoption to take place. Key finding obtained from the proposed integrative model is that there are three main stages for adopting DOI in SD projects that are creation of innovative ideas in SD projects, DOI ideas in SD projects, and adoption of innovative ideas in sustainable development projects. Each one of these stages leads to two possibilities that are the success or failure of that stage, depending of the fulfillment of the suggested factors for each option. In brief, the suggested integrated model proposes that the DOI in SD projects will succeed if the three core stages meet the success factors.},

abstract = {The health-care system in Ghana is similar to those in other developing countries and access to health services for remote communities is extremely limited. In July, 2010, the Government of Ghana launched the national e health strategy. A number of international organizations have initiated various pilot projects, including disseminating and collecting data, education initiatives and telemedicine. In addition, several institutions and organizations are dedicated to the promotion of e-health and a range of Web-based health consultancy services have begun. The main objective of this study is to provide an overview of eHealth activities in Ghana. It was a daunting task, not least because of the need to gather information on eHealth projects and initiatives in Ghana, as there is no existing repository of such information. Through literature search in Africa journals online, Hinari, Medline, Google.com, Journal of Telemedicine and e-Health, Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare, Journal of Medical Internet Research and Interaction with eHealth experts, followed up with some of the authors' for directions to other projects, and following the references in some articles. A total of twenty-two (22) pilot projects have been identified in Ghana. Mobile devices in use range from PDAs to simple phones and smart phones. The key findings of this research are that there are about 22 eHealth project at various stages of implementation in Ghana. Some of these projects have wind up and others are still being implemented. Mobile devices in use range from PDAs to simple mobile phones and smart phones. Most of the projects have been donor initiated. Data collection started in March 2010 to June 2013. Although eHealth seems to have a limited role in Ghana at present, there is growing interest in the opportunities it may offer in terms of improving the delivery and access to services, especially in remote locations. Recommendations for further research are provided.},

abstract = {This study directs its focus toward the human aspect of smart cities, a domain that has received comparatively scant attention in the existing body of literature. Using policy literacy theory, encompassing the citizens' perceptions regarding policies through the lens of their understanding, we delve into four predictors of smart city policy literacy, (1) demographics, (2) socioeconomic status, (3) geographic factors and (4) attitudes toward government. Using a national survey, we find that gender, age, income, education, marital status and the reputation of an organization are meaningfully associated with policy literacy. These findings underscore the nuanced nature of the human aspect, highlighting the significance of heterogeneous individual dispositions of smart cities. Against the backdrop of ongoing debates questioning the validity of a one-size-fits-all approach, our study embraces the multifaceted and personalized attributes of the citizenry, acknowledging the imperative role of the human dimension in designing smart cities. Points for practitioners: • Analyzing the policy literacy of citizens in the context of smart cities holds significant implications for public managers and officials, as it unveils the practical utilization of policies by service recipients. • Leveraging policy literacy theory, this research investigates individuals' smart city policy literacy and finds meaningful associations with gender, age, income, education, marital status and organizational reputation. • Acknowledging the varied viewpoints on smart cities and the limitations of a uniform approach is essential for policymakers and practitioners. This underscores the necessity of placing equal emphasis on the human aspect, taking into account the personalized needs and preferences of citizens.},

In addition, multi-input multi-output (MIMO) technique and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique with multi-antenna also enable the network to carry more users and provide multiplexing gain. In this paper, we study the maximization of energy efficiency (EE) problem in THz-NOMA-MIMO systems for the first time. And the original optimization problem is divided into user clustering, hybrid precoding and power optimization. Based on channel correlation characteristics, a fast convergence scheme for user clustering in THz-NOMA-MIMO system using enhanced K-means machine learning algorithm is proposed. Considering the power consumption and implementation complexity, the hybrid precoding scheme based on the sub-connection structure is adopted. Considering the fronthaul link capacity constraint, we design a distributed alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for power allocation to maximize the EE of THz-NOMA cache-enabled system with imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC). The simulation results show that the proposed user clustering scheme can achieve faster convergence and higher EE, the design of the hybrid precoding of the sub-connection structure can achieve lower power consumption and power optimization can achieve a higher EE for the THz cache-enabled network.},

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks are composed of a large number of disposable wireless sensors that collect information about their surrounding environment and transmit them to the end user. Because these sensors do not have rechargeable batteries, increasing their lifetime is important and various methods have been proposed to increase the lifetime of the sensor nodes in a network. Most of these methods are based on clustering or routing algorithms. The low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) algorithm is an efficient clustering algorithm where nodes within a cluster send their data to a local cluster head. Some researchers recommend a mobile sink (MS) as a way to reduce energy consumption and a rendezvous node (RN) to act as a store point for the MS. The present study proposes an algorithm that combines the use of the LEACH clustering algorithm, MS and rendezvous points (RP). Simulation results show that this method is more efficient than LEACH in terms of energy consumption, particularly in large regions.},

Structural equation modeling (SEM)with a partial least squares method was used to analyze the data collected from 296 generation Y participants. The results confirmed that performance expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions and perceived reliability positively influence the behavioral intention to adopt mHealth services. However, effort expectancy and price value did not have a significance influence on the behavioral intention. Moreover, Gender has a significant moderating effect on mHealth services adoption in certain cases. Finally, the theoretical and practical implications of this study are also discussed.},

abstract = {How do the supply and demand sides of the market respond to financial technology adop-tion? In this paper, I exploit a natural experiment that caused exogenous shocks to the adoption of a financial technology over time and space. Between 2009 and 2012, the Mexican government disbursed about one million debit cards to existing beneficiaries of its conditional cash transfer program. I combine administrative data on the debit card rollout with a rich collection of Mexican microdata on both consumers and retailers. The shock to debit card adoption has spillover effects on financial technology adoption on both sides of the market: small retailers adopt point-of-sale (POS) terminals to accept card payments, which leads other consumers to adopt cards. Specifically, the number of other consumers with debit cards increases by 21 percent. Richer consumers respond to corner stores' adoption of POS terminals by substituting 13 percent of their supermarket consumption to corner stores. Finally, I use microdata on store prices, store geocoordinates, and consumer choices across store types to estimate the consumer gains from the demand-side policy's effect on supply-side POS adoption.},

abstract = {Smart city technology is only considered in some cities depending on the resident requirements, whereas smart initiatives are adopted easily in others. One of the first critical steps toward understanding these aspects of Malaysian smart cities is to empirically study the citizens' and government agencies' aspirations to use smart city services. A Malaysia Smart Cities Stakeholders Adoption Model (MSCSA) as a case study based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) is being developed and evaluated in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. An in-depth interview with expert staff from the Plan Malaysia smart city department and Telekom Malaysia Berhad (TM one) was conducted using a mixed-methods approach. To determine the influence of seven parameters on behavioural intentions, specifically the choice to build a smart city, quantitative data were collected as questionnaires. These parameters were self-efficacy, expected effort, perceived security, perceived privacy, price value, trust in government, and trust in technology. Citizens' intentions to use smart city services were significantly influenced by each of these characteristics. There is a definite association between perceived privacy and perceived security as a core aspect of trust in technology, as well as price value, a core aspect of trust in government. When the trust in both these is strong, stakeholders are more willing to adopt and pursue smart city services. These studies provide city officials with a technique for measuring citizen desire for smart city services, as well as outlining the components necessary for establishing a good smart city strategy that is successful.},

The selection of smart city verticals (or areas of focus for smart city programs) within processes of urban governance has implications for which aspects of the urban agenda become prioritized. Through a study of seven UK smart cities, the paper investigates the framing of city problems, selection of smart verticals, and decision-making logics. The findings highlight that the selection of smart city verticals within the case study cities is rooted in four key considerations: challenges in service delivery, pragmatism, entrepreneurialism, and broader national and global events and policy agendas. These considerations transcend different spatial scales and governance arrangements, raising questions around democratic accountability and transparency. The study concludes that caution is warranted when framing smart cities as a solution to city problems.},

Meanwhile, in order to solve the problem of fault-tolerant routing repair and maintain the quality of fault-tolerant routing, the paper proposes a new routing strategy (CR-WSN). Compared with the CRAS algorithm, they have the same point that a node with more remaining energy is selected as the cluster head node, but the energy consumption ratio of CR-WSN is significantly better than CRAS.

abstract = {In today's rapidly developing world, where information technologies are becoming an indispensable component of social life, the "digital age” concept is gaining special importance. This era is characterized by the pragmatic use of digital technologies in all spheres of economic, social, and cultural activity. In this context, an important aspect of the functioning of modern society is intellectual property law, which in the digital age acquires new challenges and opportunities. Intellectual property law recognizes and protects the intellectual and creative achievements of an individual or collective, giving them the right to own and control these achievements. Importantly, intellectual property law helps stimulate creativity and innovation, as it provides appropriate economic incentives to intellectual property owners. The growing use of digital technologies and the Internet raises several new questions and challenges related to intellectual property rights. On the one hand, the digital age creates unique opportunities for the creation, distribution, and use of intellectual property, leading to new forms of creativity and supporting cultural exchange. On the other hand, it creates problems regarding the control, protection, and reproduction of this property in the digital environment, particularly the growth of piracy and copyright infringement. In the digital age, intellectual property rights become the basis for innovation, technological development, and cultural exchange. Understanding its functions, challenges, and prospects is an important task for the further development of society in the digital age. In this context, the study highlights key aspects and solutions to the problem of intellectual property rights in the digital age, in particular, the role of legal norms, protection measures, innovation, and cooperation at the international level.},

abstract = {Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices characterized by low power and low processing capabilities do not exactly fit into the provision of existing security techniques due to their constrained nature. Classical security algorithms that are built on complex cryptographic functions often require a level of processing that low-power IoT devices are incapable to effectively achieve due to limited power and processing resources. Consequently, the option for constrained IoT devices lies in either developing new security schemes or modifying existing ones to be more suitable for constrained IoT devices. In this work, an efficient security algorithm for constrained IoT devices, based on the advanced encryption standard, is proposed. We present a cryptanalytic overview of the consequence of complexity reduction together with a supporting mathematical justification, and provisioned a secure element (ATECC608A) as a tradeoff. The ATECC608A doubles for authentication and guarding against implementation attacks on the associated IoT device (ARM Cortex M4 micro-processor) in line with our analysis. The software implementation of the efficient algorithm for constrained IoT devices shows up to 35% reduction in the time it takes to complete the encryption of a single block (16 B) of plain text, in comparison to the currently used standard AES-128 algorithm, and in comparison to current results in literature at 26.6%.},

abstract = {In recent years, cities are expected to develop in line with the smart city (S.C.) idea. Cities, perceived as attractive places for people to live,must now meet many conditions. A city's duty is, among others, to meet the needs and expectations of both, its residents and newcomers, offering a wide range of opportunities for entrepreneurs, caring for the natural environment, constantly taking on new challenges, and meeting them for its further development. Thus, the management of a city involves undertaking activities in line with the smart city idea. However, to implement them, they use widely available means, defined as intelligent solutions, e.g., modern ICT technologies. In line with the smart city idea, a city is a center inhabited by people who create a civic and participatory society, having the ability to use the latest ICT solutions and having access to a range of services and solutions offered by the city. Since the smart city idea is considered at many levels, it is still unknown what dimensions or areas related to this concept are the most valuable and stimulating for its implementation. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to study what dimensions or areas related to this idea are the most valuable and stimulating for its implementation. The applied methodology is based on a critical analysis of the available literature in the form of bibliometric and citation analysis and analysis of the keyword characteristics of S.C. co-occurrences. The result of the research is a set of keywords that enable identifying the key dimensions and main areas of the implementation of S.C.},

abstract = {Despite the wealth of research on smart cities, there is a lack of studies examining interlinkages between smart cities and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In other words, there is limited research on how implementing smart city solutions can lead to co-benefits and/or trade-offs for achieving SDGs. This systematic literature review was conducted to fill this gap. Results show that responsible development/implementation of smart city solutions and technologies could contribute to the progress toward SDGs. The literature is mainly focused on SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), and SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation). More work on other SDGs is needed. There is a bias toward reporting the benefits of smart cities. These include accelerating economic growth, improving efficiency, strengthening innovation, and raising citizen awareness. These benefits indicate that smart cities could catalyze the transition to sustainable development and address climate change challenges. However, this requires addressing trade-offs related to issues such as privacy and cyber security, costs of infrastructure upgrading, rebound effects associated with efficiency improvements, biased decision-making, reproduction of social biases, digital divide and lack of skills, misuse of AI, and limited legal setup. This review elaborates on these trade-offs and offers solutions to minimize them. Results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased attention to the interactions between smart cities and the SDGs, particularly those related to health and climate action. However, it has also cemented many new unethical practices. This review highlights governance/policy challenges that should be addressed to ensure smart cities can better contribute to the SDGs. It concludes that multi-scale and transparent governance mechanisms and regulatory frameworks are crucial for ensuring that smart city solutions support the transition toward sustainable and resilient cities.},

Particular emphasis is given to Africa (Rwanda and Ethiopia) which undergoing impressive urban growth at the rate of 3.5% annually that makes Africa the fastest urbanizing place in the world. However, the development of infrastructure and industries has not kept pace with the growth in urban population. Then how should Africa leaders be prepared and deal with the booming urbanization process? Smart Leadership for Smart Cities: a solution to the booming urbanization process in the continent. Indeed, as indicated in African Smart Cities Strategies for Agenda 2063, smart leaders-smarter citizens-smarter cities can alleviate African urban challenges. Indeed, only a little research discusses political leadership and commitment/political rationalities while the literature of technology innovation/technical rationalities is abundant. Recognizing the fact that Smart cities will not succeed without developing smart leadership, Rwanda under Paul Kagame and Ethiopia under Abiy Ahmed-have launched Smart Kigali initiative and "Beautifying Sheger" project respectively with the aims to develop the entire urban ecosystem and realize smarter and sustainable neighborhoods and cities in their respective capital cities. The study employed a secondary method of data collection and analysis in combination with observation. Thus, the study concludes that political leadership is indispensable and leaders in both countries are undertaking impressive measures in transforming their country while building alliances and partnerships with various stakeholders. However, such initiatives are challenged by factors like trust and transparency, debt burden, public participation, and poor existing infrastructure. African leaders and their policymakers can learn a lot from the experiences of the two countries and their leadership style and moreover it provides a valuable contribution to the much-untouched areas of smart leadership for smart cities.},

abstract = {Cities around the world face pressing sustainability challenges such as climate change, resource scarcity, and unsustainable growth. Smart cities have emerged as a response to these challenges, leveraging information and communication technologies (ICTs) to create more efficient and liveable urban environments. However, the concept of smart cities is often defined in vague and ideologically driven terms that lack clear guidelines for promoting sustainability. In this study, we use qualitative methods to examine how the use of ICTs can support the goals of sustainability in smart city development, resulting in what we call a ‘smart sustainable city'. Drawing on a case study involving stakeholder analysis, semi-structured interviews, and document analysis, we investigate the key roles of local government, ICT firms, and citizens in shaping sustainable urban development through smart city initiatives. Our findings shed light on the potential of ICTs to promote sustainability in smart cities and provide insights for policymakers, practitioners, and scholars working towards creating more sustainable urban environments. The findings of this research showed that ICT's role in supporting sustainability in smart cities relies on understanding the interests and priorities of civic, ICT firms, and citizens, promoting effective collaboration and avoiding self-serving outcomes.},

abstract = {We develop a model where a firm has an optimal exposure to cyber risk. With rational, fully informed agents and with no hysteresis, a successful cyberattack should have no impact on a financially unconstrained target's reputation and post-attack policies. In contrast, when a successful attack involves the loss of personal financial information, there is a significant shareholder wealth loss, which is much larger than the attack's out-of-pocket costs. This excess loss is higher when the attack decreases sales growth more and lower when the board pays more attention to risk management before the attack. Further, an attack decreases a firm's risk appetite, as it beefs up its risk management and information technology and decreases the risk-taking incentives of management. Finally, successful cyberattacks adversely affect the stock price of firms in the target's industry. These results imply that successful attacks with personal financial information loss provide adverse information about cyber risk to target firms, their stakeholders, and their competitors.},

abstract = {Enhancing urban innovation resilience is crucial for adapting to change and pursuing innovation-driven, high-quality development. The global trend of digital transformation has profound implications for urban innovation; however, the specific effects of digital transformation on urban innovation resilience remain insufficiently explored. This study utilizes panel data from 285 prefecture-level and above cities in China, spanning from 2007 to 2022. It treats the Broadband China Pilot (BCP) policy as a quasi-natural experiment of digital transformation and employs a time-varying Difference-in-Differences (DID) method to investigate the impact of digital transformation on urban innovation resilience. The results yield several important insights: (i) digital transformation enhances urban innovation resilience; (ii) the effect of digital transformation on urban innovation resilience is heterogeneous across regions and city sizes; (iii) digital transformation improves urban innovation resilience through the mediation effect of green total factor productivity (GTFP); (iv) urban industrial upgrading and urban innovation vitality play significant moderating roles in the relationship between digital transformation and urban innovation resilience. These findings contribute to a deeper theoretical understanding of the relationship between digital transformation and urban innovation resilience.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

In our time a number of profound socioeconomic changes are underway. The application of these theories and schools on ICT is problematic in many respects. First, as we stated above, there is not a single, widely used paradigm which has synthesised the various schools and theories dealing with technology and society. Second, these fragmented approaches do not have a fully fledged mode of application to the relationship of ICT and (information) society. Third, SCOT, ANT, the evolutionary or the systems approach to the history of technology when dealing with information society does not take into account the results of approaches studying the very essence of the information age: information, communication and knowledge. The list of unnoticed or partially incorporated sciences, which focuses on the role of ICT in human information processing and other cognitive activities, is much longer.},

abstract = {Purpose: Nigeria has the highest burden of breast cancer (BC) in Africa. While the survival rates for BC are over 90% in many high-income countries; low-and middle-income countries like Nigeria have 40% BC survival rates. Prior studies show that the burden and poor BC survival rates are exacerbated by both health system and individual level factors, yet there is a paucity of literature on the experiences of BC survivors in Nigeria. Hence, this study explored the divergent and convergent experiences of BC survivors in accessing, navigating, and coping with treatment. Methods: Participants (N = 24, aged 35 to 73 years) were recruited and engaged in focus group discussions (group 1, n = 11; group 2, n = 13 participants). Transcripts were transcribed verbatim and analyzed with inductive thematic analysis. Results: Four themes were identified: “I am carrying this [breast cancer] alone,” “Living my life,” “‘God' helped me,” and “A very painful journey.” Participants described how they concealed their BC diagnosis from family and significant others while accessing and navigating BC treatment. Also, they adopted spiritual beliefs as a coping mechanism while sticking to their treatment and acknowledging the burden of BC on their well-being. Conclusions: Our findings explored the emotional burden of BC diagnosis and treatment and the willingness of the BC survivors to find meaning in their diagnosis. Treatment for BC survivors should integrate supportive care and innovative BC access tools to reduce pain and mitigate the burdens of BC. Implications for cancer survivors: The integration of innovative technologies for venous access and other treatment needs of BC is crucial and will improve survivorship. Non-disclosure of BC diagnosis is personal and complicated; hence, BC survivors need to be supported at various levels of care and treatment to make meaningful decisions. To improve survivorship, patient engagement is crucial in shared decision-making, collaboration, and active participation in care.},

abstract = {Heterogeneous wireless sensor network (HWSN) fulfills the requirements of researchers in the design of real life application to resolve the issues of unattended problem. But, the main constraint faced by researchers is the energy source available with sensor nodes. To prolong the life of sensor nodes and thus HWSN, it is necessary to design energy efficient operational schemes. One of the most suitable approaches to enhance energy efficiency is the clustering scheme, which enhances the performance parameters of WSN. A novel solution proposed in this article is to design an energy efficient clustering protocol for HWSN, to enhance performance parameters by EECPEP-HWSN. The proposed protocol is designed with three level nodes namely normal, advanced, and super, respectively. In the clustering process, for selection of cluster head we consider different parameters available with sensor nodes at run time that is, initial energy, hop count, and residual energy. This protocol enhances the energy efficiency of HWSN and hence improves energy remaining in the network, stability, lifetime, and hence throughput. It has been found that the proposed protocol outperforms than existing well-known LEACH, DEEC, and SEP with about 188, 150, and 141 percent respectively.},

In this paper, we look at communication protocols, which can have significant impact on the overall energy dissipation of these networks. Based on our findings that the conventional protocols of direct transmission, minimum-transmission-energy, multi-hop routing, and static clustering may not be optimal for sensor networks, we propose LEACH (Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy), a clustering-based protocol that utilizes randomized rotation of local cluster base stations (cluster-heads) to evenly distribute the energy load among the sensors in the network. LEACH uses localized coordination to enable scalability and robustness for dynamic networks, and incorporates data fusion into the routing protocol to reduce the amount of information that must be transmitted to the base station. Simulations show that LEACH can achieve as much as a factor of 8 reduction in energy dissipation compared with conventional routing protocols. In addition, LEACH is able to distribute energy dissipation evenly throughout the sensors, doubling the useful system lifetime for the networks we simulated.},

Africa's urban population is growing much faster than in Europe and is expected to surpass the rural population by 2050, when city will increase to 62% [1] and even today about 30% of citizens have no access to electricity or heating fuels. [2] The new global sustainable development goals has set as a target [3] universal access to affordable, reliable energy, and sustainable for 2030 [4]. In the implementation of Smart Cities, Africa must not be left behind: promote fair, resilient and sustainable energy systems, responsible energy industries and access for the poor to clean energy, efficient and affordable services, must be a priority also for the European Community. Access to green energy and electricity, is crucial for reducing poverty and driving sustainable economic development, it is necessary an innovative and long-term sustainable approach to design energy services to meet the needs of people living in energy poverty and not only. Africa will be 'the next big market' due to the rapid growth of emerging economies. Smart cities in Africa will be a challenge for the energy supply, use of renewable sources, a better quality of life, reduced energy consumption, less environmental impact. The key elements to achieve sustainability in developing countries will be the introduction of smart grids, smart metering, the Internet of Things (IoT), dissemination of information and communication technology (ICT): a new vision in which the citizen becomes a hub, being both consumer and producer of green energy, renewable energy spread widely in the area (solar, hydro, wind), through integration in smart grid. This paper aims to be a starting point for decision makers and for future research, highlighting how the Smart City, pose greater opportunity for developing countries like Africa, through new technologies already widely spread on the territory, jointly with the redistribution and efficient use of alternative energy sources.},

abstract = {In August 2014, the National Department of Health implemented MomConnect as a national digital maternal health program that implements the South African mobile health (mHealth) strategy and the National Health Normative Standards Framework for Interoperability in electronic health (eHealth). As the first digital health program communicating with people at scale, MomConnect enrolled more than half a million women from all regions of the country in the first year of operation, representing approximately half the number of pregnancies in the public health sector. MomConnect uses a mobile phone application to support a pregnancy registration system in antenatal care facilities, allowing pregnant women to receive stage-based messages to help them improve their health and that of their babies. Women can self-subscribe or be subscribed by community health workers to receive a limited set of health-promotion messages. Registered users interact with the system by rating the service received, asking questions, and submitting compliments or complaints. The mobile system connects to a central health-information exchange that facilitates interoperability between digital health applications and includes data validation, a national pregnancy registry and a monitoring and reporting system. Used throughout the health system at facility level, MomConnect has generated a national register of pregnant individuals and set up a national feedback system to clients. As such, it is an exemplar implementation of the Health Normative Standards Framework enabling national-level innovation as a model for future health system strengthening, enabling interoperability between digital health applications, and achieving universal health coverage. MomConnect has drawn global attention due to its innovative features and its avoidance of many of the common pitfalls when implementing digital health projects at scale in low-resource settings. This chapter focuses on the design and development of the technical infrastructure supporting MomConnect.},

abstract = {The structure of the wireless sensor network for energy management is an investigating area of research since the power resource of the sensor nodes is considered as a battery. Clustering-based methods are introduced through information aggregation to stabilize energy utilization for efficient communication amid the nodes of sensor networks. Clustering is the technique of splitting the sensing region into a number of sensor groups and allocating a leader node (Cluster Head) for that group. To enhance the search efficiency and optimal coverage the Squirrel search algorithm (SSA) is offered for cluster head election. SSA mimics the energetic searching and gliding behavior of flying squirrels (FSs). The specialty of SSA like Gliding, Seasonal monitoring condition and Predator presence probability overcomes the inconsistent tradeoffs between exploration-exploitation and global search constraints of the existing meta-heuristics algorithm. The network's performance is analyzed in terms of the overall lifespan of the nodes. The simulation results show the proposed SSA provides an improvement in residual energy and throughput by 77.66% and 28.60% respectively, than the PSO algorithm.},

However, these smart developments are often technology-centred approaches that can miss critical interactions between social and ecological components of urban systems, limiting their real impact. We draw on the social-ecological-technological systems (SETS) literature and framing to expand and improve the impact of smart city agendas. A more holistic systems framing can ensure that ‘smart' solutions better address sustainability broadly and extend to issues of equity, power, agency, nature-based solutions and ecological resilience. In this context, smart city infrastructure plays an important role in enabling new ways of measuring, experiencing and engaging with local and temporal dynamics of urban systems. We provide a series of examples of subsystems interactions, or ‘couplings', to illustrate how a SETS approach can expand and enhance smart city infrastructure and development to meet normative societal goals.},

However, existing network simulation tools do not provide a complete WSN simulation architecture, with the IR-UWB specificities at the PHYsical (PHY) and the Medium Access Control (MAC) layers. In this paper, we propose a WSN simulation architecture based on the IR-UWB technique. At the PHY layer, we take into account the pulse collision by dealing with the pulse propagation delay. We also modelled MAC protocols specific to IR-UWB, for WSN applications. To completely fit the WSN simulation requirements, we propose a generic and reusable sensor and sensing channel model. Most of the WSN application performances can be evaluated thanks to the proposed simulation architecture. The proposed models are implemented on a scalable and well known network simulator: Global Mobile Information System Simulator (GloMoSim). However, they can be reused for all other packet based simulation platforms. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

Using publicly available information on smart, alongside supplemental interviews, it sketches the type of smart city approach and initiatives that are taking hold in Newcastle, and explores the discrepancies between this and more abstract visions of the smart city. The chapter suggests that while Australian cities are broadly using smart as a way of retaining or driving economic growth and revitalisation, this is implemented in ways specific to each city's specific needs. By demanding that smart solutions are tailored to the specific needs of their city and by retaining ownership of infrastructure, the analysis specifically suggests the need for nuance in interpretations of the corporate role in the smart city.},

abstract = {Sensor nodes heterogeneity if not properly utilized could lead to uneven energy consumption and load imbalanced across the network, which degrades the performance of the network. Routing algorithms should try to achieve energy-efficiency and load-balancing among the heterogeneous nodes to prolong network lifetime. One of the solutions is by using duty-cycling in cluster-based routing such as in Sleep-awake Energy Efficient Distributed (SEED) clustering algorithm to minimize redundant transmission to achieve energy efficiency. However, this scheme suffers from idle listening problem, which lead to energy wastage across the network. Moreover, SEED cannot cope with an environment with sensor nodes with heterogeneous traffic rate. To cope with energy and traffic heterogeneity issues among sensor nodes, a traffic and energy aware routing protocol (TEAR) is proposed. TEAR avoids selecting node with low energy and high traffic rate for cluster head role to achieve load balancing. However, TEAR does not avoid redundant transmission from the sensor nodes that are in close distances. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid method called energy and traffic aware sleep-awake (ETASA) mechanism to improve energy efficiency and enhanced load balancing in heterogeneous wireless sensor network scenario. Unlike prior methods, in ETASA, the paired nodes alternate into sleep and awake mode based on node's energy and traffic rate. Moreover, we revised the conventional TDMA scheduling in SEED by allocating one slot for group of pairs in a cluster. This is done to address idle listening problem to minimize energy consumption. The proposed method improves the cluster head selection technique that selects high energy, low traffic and nodes with high number of pairs to improve balanced energy consumption. The proposed approach is evaluated and compared against the state-of-the-art baseline protocols. The result shows that the proposed ETASA has 16% and 15% lifetime improvements against TEAR and SEED.},

But acquiring data from the deployment area of a WSN is not always easy and multiple issues arise, including the limited resources of sensor devices run with one-time batteries. Additional WSN concerns include the external environment, routing, data aggregation, and ensuring quality of service (QoS) and security. Solutions have been developed for various types of application scenarios, but many problems still remain as open research challenges. Wireless Sensor Networks: Current Status and Future Trends covers the various issues associated with WSNs, including their structure, activities, and applications.

@article{Lefevre2017,
abstract = {Background: Despite the growing use of technology in the health sector, little evidence is available on the technological performance of mobile health programs nor on the willingness of target users to utilize these technologies as intended (behavioral performance). In this case study of the Mobile Technology for Health (MOTECH) program in Ghana, we assess the platform's effectiveness in delivering messages, along with user response across sites in five districts from 2011 to 2014. Methods: MOTECH is comprised of "Client Data Application (CDA) which allows providers to digitize and track service delivery information for women and infants and "Mobile Midwife" (MM) which sends automated educational voice messages to the mobile phones of pregnant and postpartum women. Using a naturalist study design, we draw upon system generated data to evaluate message delivery, client engagement, and provider responsiveness to MOTECH over time and by level of facility. Results: A total of 7,370 women were enrolled in MM during pregnancy and 14,867 women were enrolled postpa1rtum. While providers were able to register and upload patient-level health information using CDA, the majority of these uploads occurred in Community-based facilities versus Health Centers. For MM, 25% or less of expected messages were received by pregnant women, despite the majority (>77%) owning a private mobile phone. While over 80% of messages received by pregnant women were listened to, postpartum rates of listening declined over time. Only 25% of pregnant women received and listened to at least 1 first trimester message. By 6-12 months postpartum, less than 6% of enrolled women were exposed to at least one message. Conclusions: Caution should be exercised in assuming that digital health programs perform as intended. Evaluations should measure the technological, behavioral, health systems, and/or community factors which may lead to breaks in the impact pathway and influence findings on effectiveness. The MOTECH platform's technological limitations in 'pushing' out voice messages highlights the need for more timely use of data to mitigate delivery challenges and improve exposure to health information. Alternative message delivery channels (USSD or SMS) could improve the platform's ability to deliver messages but may not be appropriate for illiterate users. Trial registration: Not applicable.},

The post-industrial society's dimensions would include the spread of a knowledge class, the change from goods to services and the role of women. All of these would be dependent on the expansion of services in the economic sector and an increasing dependence on science as the means of innovating and organizing technological change.Bell prophetically stated in The Coming of the Post-Industrial Society that we should expect "...new premises and new powers, new constraints and new questions--with the difference that these are now on a scale that had never been previously imagined in world history."},

Data gathered from user and industry interviews, conducted during a field study in Tanzania between March-May 2009 is together with literature from Kenya used to compare the m-banking environment in the two countries. M-PESA is provided by mobile network operators (MNOs), Safaricom in Kenya and Vodacom in Tanzania. Both are the leading MNO in their respective country although Vodacom has a substantially lower market share and turnover compared to Safaricom. This simple fact resonates in many areas affecting M-PESA, such as: size of marketing budget, M-PESA's priority within the organization and the company's ability to quickly sign up agents and attract initial customers. Differences in the general economic situation, the geography and political history are also put forward. Kenya has a stronger economy, a higher GDP and a more developed banking system. This has contributed to the financial literacy in the country which is an important factor when communicating a service like M-PESA. Among the differences between the two implementations, we suggest that the three most influential factors to the user uptake have been the two companies ability to transform their airtime distribution into an agent network, the marketing strategy which needed to be adopted to the specific settings in each country, and the geographical and demographic conditions.},

To explore how the digital divide affects customers experiencing vulnerability, service interactions in essential service settings (health care, education, and social services) were empirically investigated and practices service system members might adopt to address vulnerability were identified. This research upframes the pillars of service inclusion framework to define human capabilities that result from service inclusion practices. Three research topics were addressed: how the digital divide affects vulnerability (RQ1), how the digital divide can be addressed through service inclusion practices (RQ2), and how service inclusion practices enable human capabilities for digital inclusion (RQ3). The findings illuminate: (1) how service employees can engage in service inclusion practices to address the digital divide (by letting go of rules and perspectives, sharing control, providing services beyond job scope, and facilitating social connections), and (2) how these service inclusion practices build human capabilities for digital inclusion (by building basic skills and capabilities for meaningful outcomes through role modeling, coaching, customer-to-customer mentoring, and expanding networks). Contributions include conceptual models of service inclusion practices and fostering digital inclusion that specify a new meso level service organization pathway for healing the digital divide.},

However, with the emergence of new networking architectures that are not amenable to traditional methods of secure communication such as data encryption, there has been an increase in interest in the potential of the physical properties of the radio channel itself to provide communications security. Information theory provides a natural framework for the study of this issue, and there has been considerable recent research devoted to using this framework to develop a greater understanding of the fundamental ability of the so-called physical layer to provide security in wireless networks. Moreover, this approach is also suggestive in many cases of coding techniques that can approach fundamental limits in practice and of techniques for other security tasks such as authentication. This paper provides an overview of these developments.},

abstract = {Effective business process management necessitates a consistent information flow between the participants in the process, the smooth integration of the flow of work, the timely sharing of data and information during the planning and implementation phases and harmonious support for the collaborative aspects of work. The recent trends in the development of advanced workflow management systems and technologies seem to be of crucial importance for facilitating these tasks within the process management context. However, workflow management systems (WfMS) follow various approaches in modelling the flow of work and hence present varying functionalities when supporting enterprise processes. The present paper examines the ways in which workflow technology may facilitate the implementation of process management, reviews the pros and cons of adopting alternative workflow representation techniques in modelling business processes and provides guidance to managers as to the characteristics, the similarities and differences of the various workflow modelling schemes. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

By using Chile as a case study, a country that has strongly promoted mobile connections to address internet access gaps, we compared mobile-only and computer users in different dimensions of the digital inclusion process, including digital skills and differentiated uses of the web. By relying on a face-to-face national representative survey, the results showed that smartphones represent an opportunity to access the internet for those who traditionally lag behind. However mobile-only use does not necessarily lead to a more complete digital inclusion process because it was related to lower levels of skills and less diverse types of uses of the web compared to those people who also use the computer. Also, skills partially mediated the association between access device and types of uses of the web, which suggests that the differences by access device partly occur because people have greater chances to develop skills when accessing the web through computers.},

abstract = {InWireless Sensor Networks, low latency, energy efficiency, and coverage problems are considered as three key issues in designing routing protocols. In this paper we present a new protocol called Low Energy Adaptive Tier Clustering Hierarchy (LEATCH), which offers a good compromise between delay and energy consumption and resolves some coverage problems. For our purpose, a two level hierarchical approach has been proposed to organize a sensor network into a set of clusters, every cluster divided into small clusters that are called Mini Clusters. As the way the clusters are organized, for each mini cluster we define a Mini Cluster-Head (MCH). Every MCH communicates with the cluster-head directly, it aggregates its mini-cluster information. In addition, we have made some changes in the procedure of cluster head and mini cluster head election. LEATCH promises better performances than the conventional LEACH protocol which is one of the most known hierarchical routing protocols using the probabilistic model to manage the energy consumption in WSNs. Simulation results show that LEATCH performs better than LEACH in term of energy, delay, coverage and scalability.},

The epidemiology of counterfeits is also wide in breadth and scope, including thousands of counterfeit incidents per year, encompassing all types of therapeutic classes, and employing a complex global supply chain network enabling this illegal activity. In addition, information technologies available through the Internet and sales via online pharmacies have allowed the criminal element to thrive in an unregulated environment of anonymity, deception, and lack of adequate enforcement. Though recent global enforcement efforts have led to arrests of online counterfeit sellers, such actions have not stemmed supplies from illegal online sellers or kept up with their creativity in illegally selling their products. To address this issue, we propose a global policy framework utilizing public-private partnership models with centralized surveillance reporting that would enable cooperation and coordination to combat this global health crisis. {\textcopyright} 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

In this regard, the objective of this work was to identify which factors influence the acceptance of IT in public safety in the context of smart city. For this purpose, the qualitative approach was used, through semi-structured interviews with representatives of the Military Police and the Civil Police in Pato Branco-PR, in order to investigate thoroughly the constructs of the UTAUT model, proposed by Venkatesh et al. (2003). The main system cited by the authorities was the monitoring by cameras, called Safe Look Program. The results show that in the performance expectation, the monitoring system has quality images, which help in the people's identification. Concerning the effort expectation, the ideal would be the integration with the particular systems. Regarding the social influence, both police use social networks, by directing the sector, to publicize the work and make investigations. In relation to the facilitating conditions, there are difficulties with the functionalities of the monitoring software. With regard to smart cities, there are indications that the services are still in the process of being adjusted and they can be optimized. Furthermore, the participation of the citizen and the municipal administration is important in order to implement more services.},

Thus, the problem is not the existence of technology solutions for smart cities concepts, but how to develop services that will involve citizens to share information about the events in the city. Social psychology theories point out that sense of bellowing, perceived enjoyment, perceived reciprocal benefits, power of knowledge, outcome expectation and perceived status, provides an involvement for citizens to share information and knowledge. In this paper, we propose to relate those theories, with the intension to use a mobile augmented reality service. We created an online survey, based in a scenario with a video, where the participants visualize a character behavior sharing and getting information in the city, using a mobile augmented reality service. The results confirm that the participants accept and want to use a mobile augmented reality service in a smart city, and have been identify the factors that could be more associated with the intention to use the augmented reality technology in the smart city, namely perceived enjoyment, intention to share experience, intention to get knowledge, perceived value, perceived similarity and perceived reciprocal benefits. Exploring those constructs inside gamification solutions in this mobile augmented reality service, is discussed in the conclusion.},

The existing cloud services lack the potential to meet the peculiar requirements of IoT devices. IoT devices generate a huge amount of data and demand quick response time. Fog computing can be used to process the IoT tasks since fog nodes are comparatively closer to the IoT devices. The fog node selection for prospective IoT tasks is a multiple-criteria decision-making problem due to the diversity in the IoT requirements and the presence of a number of heterogeneous fog nodes in the smart city. However, there is no study that focused on the fog node selection mechanism keeping in view the user preferences, user requirements (URs), and optimised resource usage. This study presents the best fit-power weighted difference (BF-PWD) method for fog node selection that is used to rank and subsequently select the fog nodes for task offloading from IoT devices. The simulation results show that the proposed technique BF-PWD not only improves the success rate but also reduces the communication latency and the UR violations compared to the existing protocols.},

abstract = {The term 'smart cities' is a widely used, but at the same time a highly fuzzy concept. The fuzziness hinders our understanding on the benefits of its adoption, and explains the existence of many relevant activities with fragmented or distorted views of what a truly smart city is. The aim of this paper is to undertake a comprehensive review of how smart cities are perceived in the literature and in the light of the findings propose a clearer definition. Overview of the key terms, concepts and definitions associated to smart cities, reported in this paper, demonstrates that the definitions found in the academic literature have limited scope, and are overly focused on strategic drivers and specific actions, instead of making explicitly the connection between the concept of smart cities and the creation of environments that promote happiness and wellbeing of their residents-which should be the main function of a city. Following the thorough review on the smart cities literature, the paper proposes a comprehensive, human-centred, and context-free definition for smart cities. This definition brings an endogenous view on smart cities in which the central element is the direct participation of local actors and stakeholders in the process of thinking, defining, planning, and executing social, technological and urban transformations in cities.},

abstract = {Purpose: Smart city services (SCS) in contrast with other technology-based services, demand significant interaction and collaboration between the users and the service providers. This study examines the SCS delivery-channel characteristics and the users' personal (behavioral and demographic) characteristics that influence their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the services, as well as their intention to adopt (i.e. continue using) the SCS-delivery channels. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative study using a structured questionnaire was conducted for this paper. The data-collection method was administered by emailing the survey to a list of 2,350 city/urban residents who are members of the two largest universities in the greater Dubai metropolis. A total of 600 completed responses (26 percent) were received back, while 580 useable responses (25 percent) were analyzed for this paper. Findings: Our initial findings suggest that contrary to popular belief, it is not only SCS channel factors that influence user satisfaction and continuance intention. SCS users' personal characteristics (such as their user innovativeness and control-seeking behavior) are also pivotal in determining their satisfaction and intention to continue or not continue using the SCS-delivery channels. Research limitations/implications: The paper argues that both SCS channel factors and SCS users' personal characteristics jointly influence the users' experience of the services and therefore jointly determine their satisfaction with the service as well as their SCS usage continuance intention. The result of our research gives important insights into users' behaviors toward the emerging SCS channels in general, and it will be of great value to architects and designers of Smart City technologies around the world. Practical implications: The paper argues that both SCS channel factors and SCS users' personal (behavioral and demographic) characteristics jointly influence the users' trials of the services, and therefore jointly determine their satisfaction with the service as well as their SCS usage continuance intention. The result of our research gives important insights into users' behavioral intentions toward the emerging SCS channels in general; and it will be of great value to architects and designers of Smart City technologies around the world. Originality/value: This paper is one of the first few studies focused on investigating the antecedents of SCS usage behaviors in the Middle Eastern region.},

This paper modified the technology acceptance model to find out factors influencing customers' intention to use AV such as perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, social influence, and facilitating condition, and the moderating effects of demographic variables (gender, age, family size, income, education level, and marital status) on the relationship between predictors and intention to use AV. Online questionnaires were distributed to 318 participants in South Korea and the data was analyzed through multiple regression and integration moderation test. The findings show that social influence, facilitating conditions, and perceived usefulness are three important variables of AV usage intention. In addition, demographic variables (age, marital status, family size, and educational level) can moderate effect of PU and SI on intention to use AV. Strategic directions are suggested to managers to increase the possibility of customers' acceptance of AV.},

This trend is of interest, as cities can only be smart if they are responsive to their citizens. In this paper, the intention to use such a mobile application among adult residents (n = 420) of a mid-sized city in the southeastern United States was examined using hierarchical linear regression analysis. The regression model that was tested indicated significant predictors of the intention to use the app in order to report municipal problems, such as power outages, and to request services for one's home or community, including: Performance expectancy (e.g., citizens' beliefs that the app would be efficient, helpful, convenient), effort expectancy (citizens' beliefs about difficulty of using the app), social influence, perceived cost (e.g., privacy loss, storage space, unwanted notifications), and prior use of city apps. Consistent with current research on technology adoption, performance expectancy had the strongest influence on app-use intentions. Additionally, citizens' trust in their city government's ability to effectively manage an app was a weak, positive predictor of app-use intentions; general trust in the city government did not predict app-use intentions. Implications for city governments and city app developers are discussed.},

Although the relevance of new technologies as strategic levers for crisis resolution has been widely debated before the pandemic, especially in the smart cities' context, how individuals have agreed to include the technological changes dictated by the pandemic in their daily interactions remains an open question. This paper aims at detecting citizens' sentiment toward technology before and after the emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic using Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis (FFCA) to analyze a large corpus of tweets. Specifically, citizens' attitudes in five cities (Berlin, Dublin, London, Milan, and Madrid) were explored to extract and classify the key topics related to the degree of confidence, familiarity and approval of new technologies. The results shed light on the complex technology acceptance process and help managers identify the potential negative effects of smart technologies. In this way, the study enhances scholars' and practitioners' understanding of the strategies for enabling the use of technology within smart cities to manage the transformations introduced by the health emergency and guide citizens' behaviour.},

This study explores the acceptance of use of mobile phone data (MPD) in different areas, and how it is related to different types of trust. Based on a representative survey of citizens in the two smart cities, Oslo and Tallinn, four similar trust cultures are located. The acceptance of use of MPD differed significantly between the trust cultures and, as expected, was significantly stronger in groups with higher levels of trust, either generally or in terms of reliance on technologies. The acceptance of use of MPD for commercial product development was low for all groups. Findings suggest that future users of MPD need to be aware of the significant scepticism toward and rejection of the use of such data in large parts of the population. Unless visions of the smart city are grounded in the needs and wants of citizens, such plans are not likely to succeed, and negative understandings and images of a panoptic state may take stronger hold. As for now, however, there seems to be insufficient social trust to exploit this on a wider scale without creating even more scepticism and distrust.},

Therefore, the adoption of all areas of the smart city holds great research potential. The purpose of this paper is thus to provide an insight into millennials' adoption of autonomous vehicles (AV), which are at the forefront of future transport. Millennials are an important focus group for smart city concepts since they are keen to adopt technology and new transport modes. Our research focuses on technology adoption, perception of the benefits, security, safety, mobility-related efficiencies and concerns as the key AV adoption factors. The impact of these factors is empirically tested with structural equation modelling using data from 382 millennials. We confirm the perceived benefits of AV are vital factors for AV adoption whereas the perceived safety of AV significantly reduces the influence of various concerns regarding AV.},

The data were collected using questionnaire targeting citizens in 7 sub-districts of Surabaya city. The number of sample size is calculated using Slovin formula collecting 156 valid responses. This study suggests that the most significant determinant of user's intention to use the City113 mobile application is attitude (R2 = 0.435, t=5.238). There are only two factors influencing the attitude towards using the City113: Perceived Ease of Use and Perceived Usefulness. Citizens may have a positive or negative feeling towards using an e-government citizen report system mainly influenced by their perceptions on whether the system is easy to use and whether the system will deliver benefits for them or not.},

abstract = {The concept of a smart city is now expected to be a solution to various city problems that are becoming increasingly complex. IoT and ICT-based city governance are expected to be able to carry out efficiency in monitoring and managing traffic, transportation systems, power plants, water supply networks, waste management, crime detection, schools, libraries, hospitals, etc. However, in its implementation, there are many crucial problems such as lack of competent human resources, ICT policies, and governance that have not been efficient, lack of government commitment and lack of community participation. This study aims to identify crucial factors in the process of readiness and application of the smart city concept to regional governments in Indonesia. The method used is descriptive quantitative by conducting a smart city readiness survey on related stakeholders, namely the government and the community. The combination of models in Delone & McLean and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is used as a research framework. Data analysis used the Structural Equation Modeling model with the help of AMOS 24.0 Software. The results of the study are that there is a significant relevance to the model constituent variables. This research contributes to the relationship model of smart city preparedness factor and the recommendation that the government and stake-holders pay more attention to the factors that determine the success of the application of the concept of a smart city.},

This creates a concept called "Smart City" where all the things that people do everyday in the city become integrated and sustainable by technology. Currently in Indonesia all business sectors have entered an era where digital platform plays an important role in it, PT Railink is one of them, PT Railink as a new provider of airport rail services issued online ticketing service based on smartphones, which of course aims to facilitate consumers to be more convenient to book the airport train tickets, but currently Railink application may not be widely accepted by the users of this service. This study focuses on measuring the acceptability of technology in Railink applications by using TAM and TRA modifications based on the SEM methodology. This research was conducted in Jakarta with two study materials, which are X and Y generations society. The result of research shows high positive impression felt about the usefulness and easiness for both generations. Analysis of technology adoption lifecycle and technology roadmaping shows that Railink application has been adopted by early majority and late majority. This indicates that the Railink app is in the ascent and mature stages, so it's important for application developers to continue promoting in order to attract more X generation to use Railink application, and for Y generation, developers should keep updating features, and make a loyalty points for the Y generation to continue using the Railink application for the next 5-10 years.},

The goal of the app is that users are notified if they were in contact with others infected. It also allows creating a heat map identifying streets, squares, and commercial locations to which contaminated users were, allowing more assertive hygiene actions and eliminating infectious disease outbreaks. Our methodology aimed on finding whether people would be willing to share their location, as well as their health issues related to COVID-19. It is composed by a survey for verifying the interest of the proposed application; the prototype of the application; and the use of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). We can see that the vast majority of respondents to the first survey were interested in using a contact tracking application, even though they need to share their location and report when they become infected. In addition, the proposed RISCOVID application proved to be accepted for use by participants in the second survey.},

abstract = {Local urban identity, culture and knowledge ecosystems continue to shape innovative capacity and technological acceptance despite global exchange in talent, trade and technology. This has important implications for the development and implementation of future smart cities. The last two decades of smart city research has presented smart cities as a generic, universal aspiration without taking into consideration such local cultural differences. Future smart cities have several tasks ahead of them. The first is selecting culturally appropriate technologies from the vast array of global technologies now on offer. The second task is adapting such technology and the third task is in managing the acceptance of such technology. The above process is not linear but must be iterative, with technology acceptance considered simultaneously alongside the selection and adoption of such technologies. This study integrates the substantial literature on Technology Acceptance Modelling into the smart city discourse to begin to address this need. It also further develops our understanding of technology acceptance using the Structural Equation Modelling Method. A new synthetic model is proposed consisting of twelve factors, which have been selected based on a targeted literature review. A survey-based method was used to develop and cross-validate the model sampling a diverse population from various Iranian cities. The result of the above process is a new model named the Urban Services Technology Acceptance Model (USTAM). The validated model includes key factors related to technology such as Self-Efficacy, Operation, Work Facilitation, Relative Advantage and Compatibility. The USTAM is a useful tool for the prediction of technology acceptance in the implementation of smart cities. The final model is significant for various reasons. Firstly, it is significant for ensuring that selected technology is appropriate to local cultural contexts. Secondly it is significant to ensure that integration of technologies at metropolitan scales is managed effectively. The final significant reason is that it is well-suited to helping developing economies participate in the smart city boom in a resource efficient manner. The proposed model can potentially help cities achieve this by guiding them in the selection of appropriate technologies. The proposed model is developed with specific reference to Iran and Bangladesh. The authors suggest that the model is useful for cities of different cultural identities and characteristics, who wish to initiate their own distinctive smart city strategies.},

abstract = {We discuss the user study of a mobile cultural heritage game designed to stimulate reflection about a city's history. Aided by location-aware technology, the game fosters the serendipitous discovery of points of interest, historical images and stories, whilst players wander the city. This exploration differs from the typical precalculated path recommendations used by other location-based applications. It triggers reflection about the city's past that is as unique as its visitors. Ours is one of the first studies to attempt an understanding of the effects of serendipitous urban discovery and historic reflection-triggering technologies on user experience. We combined field trials with controlled experiments, analysing perceptions of the experience and value using responses expressed in open-ended questionnaire items. Using thematic coding and sentiment analysis, we observed types of emotional responses, indicating four potential profiles of their likelihood towards future technology adoption. Enthusiastic and Interested users appreciated the freedom of movement choice that created an autonomous experience that fostered a sense of personal accomplishment. The interface interactions of the game, designed to stimulate reflection, supported a feeling of connectedness to others. In contrast, Cynical and Sceptical users were less tolerant of perceived technological issues, requiring more perfection in functionality and design. These users are less likely to be the early adopters of serendipitous location-based apps. The game was developed as part of a large cultural informatics project but, unlike typical evaluations, we conducted this study midway through the project and not at its end. This approach (1) gave the team the possibility to take stock, pause, and reflect and (2) provided insight on future design improvements for increasing the perceived value of serendipitous urban discovery applications. Our results contribute towards a grounded understanding of user experience and help progress the development of cultural heritage applications that incorporate elements of reflection and/or place-based exploration into their functionalities.},

In this light, this study examines the potential digital divide in the advanced technologies used in the emerging 5G smart city era. Using survey data, we investigate if the smart citizens' social and technical readiness in terms of the use experience and necessity of new technologies can predict the adoption and use of the emerging 5G smart city innovations. The empirical results from this study can inform the digital divide between the general public and technology-disadvantaged groups. The findings can also guide policymakers in prioritizing technologies that are accessible and beneficial to all potential residents of smart cities in the future. Finally, the results yield specific policy implications for practitioners who design more inclusive and sustainable smart cities in the 5G era.},

abstract = {A respectable amount of work dealing with Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) clearly indicates a popularity of TAM in the field of technology acceptance in general. Nevertheless, there is still a gap in existing knowledge regarding representative academic literature that underlie research on TAM in educational context. The main objective of this systematic literature review is to provide an overview of the current state of research efforts on TAM application in the field of learning and teaching for a variety of learning domains, learning technologies and types of users. Through systematic search by the use of EBSCO Discovery Service, the review has identified 71 relevant studies ranged between 2003 and 2018. The main findings indicate that TAM and its many different versions represent a credible model for facilitating assessment of diverse learning technologies. TAM's core variables, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, have been proven to be antecedent factors affecting acceptance of learning with technology. The paper identifies some gaps in current work and suggests areas for further investigation. The results of this systematic review provide a better understanding of TAM acceptance studies in educational context and create a firm foundation for advancing knowledge in the field. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Technology acceptance research in teaching and learning context has become an attractive trend. A number of reviews and meta-analysis focused on specific topics related to technology acceptance in education have been conducted. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is the key model in understanding predictors of human behaviour towards potential acceptance or rejection of the technology. What this paper adds The state of current research on Technology Acceptance Model application in educational context lacks comprehensive reviews addressing variety of learning domains, learning technologies and types of users. The paper presents systematic review of relevant academic literature on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) in the field of learning and teaching. The paper provides empirical evidence on the predictive validity of the models based on TAM presented in selected literature. The findings revealed that TAM, along with its many different versions called TAM++, is a leading scientific paradigm and credible model for facilitating assessment of diverse technological deployments in educational context. TAM's core variables, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, have been proven to be antecedent factors that have affected acceptance of learning with technology. Implications for practice and/or policy The systematic review adds to the body of knowledge and creates a firm foundation for advancing knowledge in the field. By following the most common research objectives and/or by filling current gaps in applied research methods, chosen sample groups and types of result analysis, an own study could be conducted. Future research may well focus on identifying additional external factors that could further explain acceptance and usage of various learning technologies.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to identify the factors influencing the citizens of India to prevent cybercrimes in the proposed Smart Cities of India. Design/methodology/approach: A conceptual model has been developed for identifying factors preventing cybercrimes. The conceptual model was validated empirically with a sample size of 315 participants from India. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling with SPSS and AMOS softwares. Findings: The study reveals that the “awareness of cybercrimes” significantly influences the actual usage of technology to prevent cybercrimes in Smart Cities of India. The study reveals that government initiative (GI) and legal awareness are less influential in spreading of the awareness of cybercrimes (AOC) to the citizens of the proposed smart cities. Research limitations/implications: The conceptual model utilizes two constructs from the technology adoption model, namely, perceived usefulness and ease of use. The study employs other factors such as social media, word of mouth, GIs, legal awareness and organizations constituting entities spreading awareness from different related literature works. Thereby, a comprehensive theoretical conceptual model has been proposed which helps to identify the factors that may help in preventing cybercrimes. Practical implications: This study provides an insight to the policy maker to understand several factors influencing the AOC of the citizens of the proposed Smart Cities of India for the prevention of cybercrimes. Originality/value: There are few existing studies analyzing the effect of AOC to mitigate cybercrimes. Thus, this study offers a novel contribution.},

abstract = {Measuring and benchmarking the maturity of public service organizations is a challenging and time-consuming job as they differ in scope, size, and complexity. Existing growth models often use instruments that are generic, have no measures and do not relate the stages to the actual realisation of the systems architecture. Furthermore, these approaches take a one size fits all approach instead of a customized approach. Although the type of information to be measured can vary among different organizations, these approaches use similar instruments (e.g. stage models) and indicators (e.g. stages). Therefore, in this paper we propose a multi-level framework in which measures can be selected based on the domain and case specific needs and characteristics. Specifically, our framework focuses on measuring enterprise architecture, by looking at the blueprint for ICT infrastructure, information systems, organizational as well as technical aspects, horizontal and vertical integration and interoperability, and rules, regulations, laws, and legislations etc. Enterprise architecture provides basic understanding about the different elements of a public organization in a systematic manner. Therefore, this paper subsequently investigates the use of enterprise architecture and stages-of-growth models for measuring public organizations by means of an explorative case study of Dutch tax department using a multi-level architectural framework. The case study shows that the organizational information that can be retrieved from enterprise architecture is useful to measure and benchmark public organizations, which is hardly possible using state-of-growth models. The proposed multi-level framework is capable of measuring and benchmarking the information at the different levels by allowing public organizations to use multiple assessment approaches (e.g. stage models) and connecting them to enterprise architecture.

abstract = {The recent development of web-based services that combine spatial coordinates and indexes of online material allows any web user to conduct geographically referenced Internet searches. In this paper we characterize the resulting hybrid space as DigiPlace - that is, the use of information ranked and mapped in cyberspace to navigate and understand physical places. We review relevant theories of hybrid combinations of physical and virtual space, how software (code) automatically produces space, and how the politics of code (particularly map generating code) shape the representation of places. The paper concludes with a case study of the DigiPlace created by GoogleMaps that utilizes the same code which powers Google's index of cyberspace. A central argument advanced by the case study concerns how the interactions between culture, code, information, and place construct DigiPlace and shade perceptions of the places that are mapped. {\textcopyright} 2007 a Pion publication printed in Great Britain.},

The first is in the form of the development of a comprehensive conceptualization of smart city as a resource for researchers and government practitioners; the second is in the form of the creation of a bridge between smart cities research and practice expertise. City governments increasingly need innovative arrangements to solve a variety of technical, physical, and social problems. "Smart city" could be used to represent efforts that in many ways describe a vision of a city, but there is little clarity about this new concept. This paper proposes a comprehensive conceptualization of smart city, including its main components and several specific elements. Academic literature is used to create a robust framework, while a review of practical tools is used to identify specific elements or aspects not treated in the academic studies, but essential to create an integrative and comprehensive conceptualization of smart city. The paper also provides policy implications and suggests areas for future research in this topic.},

Despite the strong financial and institutional supports from the central government, the performances of smart city initiatives significantly vary across pilot sites. Considering smart city initiatives as government innovation and drawing on the government innovation diffusion theories, an explanatory model has been developed to examine their variance and test it with a cross-sectional dataset using multiple regression methods. It was found that although environmental pollution was a key driver for the development of smart city in China, such environmental pollution like air pollution in particular had a curvilinear relationship (bell-shaped) with smart city development. In addition, smart cities initiatives in China were driven not only by technical rationalities but also political rationalities. Political supports from local ruling party sectaries made a difference.},

To date, the extant tourism literature on meetings, incentives, conventions, and exhibitions (MICE) tourism primarily focuses on value co-creation in the tourism industry, overlooking its integration into the urban environment for (i) city (and smart city) projects and (ii) its nexus with social aspects such as crime, which influences and shapes the urban environment. Considering 30 Italian cities over 13 years, this study employs a spatial-panel data approach to disentangle these relationships. The estimated results demonstrate that while urban mobility practices are highly responsive to MICE tourism, they are influenced by imbalances from increased users and visitors, which in turn affects urban security. This dynamic reduces the positive effect of MICE tourism on urban mobility, creating imbalances that public managers and policymakers must address. Practical implications are suggested to harness the potential of MICE tourism in current smart city projects.},

There are both positive and negative consequences of urban sprawl, but the latter are far more numerous, so solutions are needed. Therefore, four questions have been formulated for this paper: 1. What are the negative consequences of urban sprawl? 2. Are there positive aspects to the phenomenon? 3. Do the negative consequences outweigh the positive ones? 4. What should be done to mitigate the negative consequences of urban sprawl? This study aims to identify a set of actions that can reduce the identified negative consequences of urban sprawl. We believe that the key at the planning level is to implement the concept of the smart blue-green city, which respects social needs. The elements of the proposed solution have been selected with a view to reducing the phenomenon of urban sprawl, i.e. keeping people in the city, rather than designing the urban and suburban structure.</p>},

The many positive attributes of networks are often featured - the capacity to solve problems, govern shared resources, create learning opportunities, and address shared goals - and a literature focused on the challenges networks pose for managers seeking to realize these network attributes is developing. The authors share an interest in understanding the potential of networks to govern complex public, or "wicked," problems. A fundamental challenge to effectively managing any public problem in a networked setting is the transfer, receipt and integration of knowledge across participants. When knowledge is viewed pragmatically, the challenge is particularly acute. This perspective, the authors argue, presents a challenge to the network literature to consider the mind-set of the managers - or collaborative capacity-builders - who are working to achieve solutions to wicked problems. This mind-set guides network managers as they apply their skills, strategies, and tools in order to foster the transfer, receipt, and integration of knowledge across the network and, ultimately, to build long-term collaborative problem-solving capacity. {\textcopyright} 2008 The American Society for Public Administration.},

abstract = {Purpose - The objective of this paper is to study the development of e-government initiatives at the regional and local level in the EU through the opinion of those agents directly involved in the projects. Design/methodology/ approach - The authors wrote a questionnaire that was sent to the regions and the largest cities of EU countries, in order to find out their degree of involvement in e-government initiatives. Responses were received from 47 regional and local governments. Findings - At present, most regional and local governments have a web site, although in most cases it is little more than a governmental billboard. E-government is not likely to remodel governance in the short term, since democracy initiatives are not on the present agenda of most EU countries. The survey findings show that e-government initiatives are still predominantly non-interactive and non-deliberative. They tend to reflect present service delivery patterns, not transform them. Research limitations/ implications - The construction and management of web sites is becoming an essential element of modern public administration, but little is known about how these initiatives are being implemented. Given the substantial investment in time and other resources for governmental online initiatives, it is essential to begin to evaluate governmental web site initiatives in terms of quality and effectiveness. Originality/value - This work is of value as, to date, there are very few studies that benchmark local government web sites across the EU. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Positing that the MI-performance relationship is complex and is conditional over other characteristics of the organization, we examine the influence of MI on organizational performance both directly and indirectly through performance management (PM). PM is an important organizational process characteristic arising from public management reform and in itself influences performance. We test our hypotheses using structural equation models with data from three sources in English local governments. The findings indicate that the impact of MI on performance is not direct; it is mediated by PM. We also find that PM positively affects organizational performance. In conclusion, we discuss the implications of these findings for research and practice. {\textcopyright} The Author 2010.

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to identify those factors which account for administrative innovation in municipal government bureaucracies. Two dimensions of administrative innovation are examined: management and technology. Management innovation refers to procedures and methods by which policies are implemented. Technology innovation refers to the adoption of new physical products or processes. Multiple indicators of specific innovative practices are used to create a management scale and a technology scale and the two scales are then combined to create a composite administration innovation scale. In order to explain the dimensions of innovation the study employs a model comprised of three sets of independent variables: community variables, political system variables, and bureaucratic variables. Multiple regression analysis is used to examine the relationship between each set of independent variables and the dimensions of innovation. A second stage of analysis combines the three sets of explanatory variables into a single equation for each type of innovation. The results indicate that the three sets of variables are of significant power in explaining innovation, although as one moves from community variables to political variables to bureaucratic variables there is a decline in the amount of variation explained. Some variables are more important for certain types of innovation than for others, but population size, community growth rate, and electoral competition cut across the various types of innovation. {\textcopyright} 1985, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

abstract = {According to Layne and Lee (2001), electronic Government (e-Government, e-Gov) progresses towards higher levels of integration and interoperability among and between government levels and branches. Interoperability in essence leads to extensive information sharing among and between governmental entities. However, the obstacles, which prevent a rapid progress into that direction, are not merely technical. In fact, the technology side may prove the least difficult to address, while the organizational, legal, political, and social aspects may prove much more of a challenge. The case in point presented in this paper is Washington State's Justice Information Network (JIN), which attempts to share and interoperate criminal and judicial information between state and local governments. Progress towards sustainable information sharing requires many players seeking the same ends in an ongoing fashion, not just a huge upfront and one-time effort as the case illustrates.},

Yet, most integration and interoperation efforts meet serious challenges and constraints.

We propose future research projects to study the foci and purposes, limitations and constraints, as well as processes and outcomes of integration and interoperation in electronic Government.

An assessment analysis of the status quo and the emerging trends is made using the e-readiness index in the context of an e-City Governance Integrated Framework. The discussion is based on literature review, survey, and case study research undertaken as part of the IntelCities Integrated Project. Particularly, the ongoing changes in twelve European cities are considered using a set of nine qualitative indicators taken in relation. Future progress, policy priorities and investment opportunities are linked to strategic development trends, governance challenges, institutional (process and management) change, and policy innovation. Consequently, nine propositions about the future of e-City Governance in Europe are formulated. A conclusion is then made that urban governments will need to adapt their e-governance approaches to innovation policy-making strategically and in the light of the emerging pressures from the competitive city in the global economy and a more complex networked and knowledge urban society that will bring about the intelligent city and region of tomorrow.},

abstract = {The current literature on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and planning suggests that the use of Information Technology (IT) in local government can enhance the management and functioning of cities. Of particular interest is the phenomenon of e-government, where debates and information surrounding local government matters are conducted in cyberspace. Of relevance also, are the networking opportunities that the Internet can facilitate between city governments and the institutional learning that can emanate from that. The increasing use of web-based Geographic Information Systems (GIS) applications raises awareness of spatial issues that impact on defined municipal areas, whilst interactive mapping provides opportunities for addressing spatial concerns virtually. Most of the literature does, however, focus on the experience of developed countries where capacity and resources permit a sophisticated understanding of ICT. Yet, evidence suggests that these tools are also used in some developing countries, with India often cited as one of the leading countries in achieving ICT prominence, but little seems to be published about this experience in Southern Africa. There are a number of innovative initiatives underway in South African local governments but most of these interventions are in their infancy. In contrast, there are a number of examples in developed countries that may provide some guidance for developing cities. This paper examines the Smart City initiative in Brisbane in Australia, and compares it with moves currently underway in Durban, South Africa to incorporate ICT in local governance. The intention is to expose the differences in approach, understand the capacity and resource issues that may impact, and draw some conclusions with regards to future interventions in Durban. Overall, the paper provides an initial conceptual landscape that begins to determine the extent to which ICT in local government can provide opportunities for Durban by learning from the experience of Brisbane, Australia. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Illustrative cases reveal that those aspects typically associated with entrepreneurship, such as innovation, risk acceptance, pro-activeness and growth, are supported by a number of other elements within the public sector context studied. These elements include external drivers related to performance, including operational excellence and cost efficiency. They also comprise internal facilitators such as a more flexible culture, an investment in people, a focus on branding, and the deliberate application and transfer of knowledge. The implications are twofold. First, that innovation and entrepreneurship in the public sector can go beyond government policy-making, with the SOE model representing an important policy decision and sector of the New Zealand Government. And second, that the impact of several SOEs on international markets suggests competition on the global stage will increasingly come from both public and private sector organisations. {\textcopyright} 2011 eContent Management.},

It is the result of an initiative of the Chilean government to reinforce its e-government strategy. The proposed model, called eGov-MM (e-Government Maturity Model), has three dimensions (a cube) supporting business processes: information criteria, IT resources, and leverage domains. Changing the traditional and exclusive focus on IT, four Leverage Domains are defined: e-Strategy, IT Governance, Process Management, and People and Organization Capabilities. The Leverage Domains generate a hierarchical structure with a second level named Key Domain Areas. These areas should be measurable and controllable, so they are related to a third hierarchical level, called Critical Variables, allowing the model's elements to be assessed qualitatively and quantitatively. The capability and maturity of these variables associated with the intersection with the other two axes of the cube establish five levels of capability. The proposed model is strongly supported by the international experience and best practices for IT management and has already been field tested. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2008.},

Yet despite numerous examples of this 'urban labelling' phenomenon, we know surprisingly little about so-called smart cities, particularly in terms of what the label ideologically reveals as well as hides. Due to its lack of definitional precision, not to mention an underlying self-congratulatory tendency, the main thrust of this article is to provide a preliminary critical polemic against some of the more rhetorical aspects of smart cities. The primary focus is on the labelling process adopted by some designated smart cities, with a view to problematizing a range of elements that supposedly characterize this new urban form, as well as question some of the underlying assumptions/ contradictions hidden within the concept. To aid this critique, the article explores to what extent labelled smart cities can be understood as a high-tech variation of the 'entrepreneurial city', as well as speculates on some general principles which would make them more progressive and inclusive.},

abstract = {This paper describes the information technology (IT) foundation and principles for Smarter Cities. Smarter Cities are urban areas that exploit operational data, such as that arising from traffic congestion, power consumption statistics, and public safety events, to optimize the operation of city services. The foundational concepts are instrumented, interconnected, and intelligent. Instrumented refers to sources of near-real-time real-world data from both physical and virtual sensors. Interconnected means the integration of those data into an enterprise computing platform and the communication of such information among the various city services. Intelligent refers to the inclusion of complex analytics, modeling, optimization, and visualization in the operational business processes to make better operational decisions. This approach enables the adaptation of city services to the behavior of the inhabitants, which permits the optimal use of the available physical infrastructure and resources, for example, in sensing and controlling consumption of energy and water, managing waste processing and transportation systems, and applying optimization to achieve new efficiencies among these resources. Additional roles exist in intelligent interaction between the city and its inhabitants and further contribute to operational efficiency while maintaining or enhancing quality of life. {\textcopyright} 2010 IBM.},

abstract = {Producing literature reviews of complex evidence for policymaking questions is a challenging methodological area. There are several established and emerging approaches to such reviews, but unanswered questions remain, especially around how to begin to make sense of large data sets drawn from heterogeneous sources. Drawing on Kuhn's notion of scientific paradigms, we developed a new method - meta-narrative review - for sorting and interpreting the 1024 sources identified in our exploratory searches. We took as our initial unit of analysis the unfolding 'storyline' of a research tradition over time. We mapped these storylines by using both electronic and manual tracking to trace the influence of seminal theoretical and empirical work on subsequent research within a tradition. We then drew variously on the different storylines to build up a rich picture of our field of study. We identified 13 key meta-narratives from literatures as disparate as rural sociology, clinical epidemiology, marketing and organisational studies. Researchers in different traditions had conceptualised, explained and investigated diffusion of innovations differently and had used different criteria for judging the quality of empirical work. Moreover, they told very different over-arching stories of the progress of their research. Within each tradition, accounts of research depicted human characters emplotted in a story of (in the early stages) pioneering endeavour and (later) systematic puzzle-solving, variously embellished with scientific dramas, surprises and 'twists in the plot'. By first separating out, and then drawing together, these different meta-narratives, we produced a synthesis that embraced the many complexities and ambiguities of 'diffusion of innovations' in an organisational setting. We were able to make sense of seemingly contradictory data by systematically exposing and exploring tensions between research paradigms as set out in their over-arching storylines. In some traditions, scientific revolutions were identifiable in which breakaway researchers had abandoned the prevailing paradigm and introduced a new set of concepts, theories and empirical methods. We concluded that meta-narrative review adds value to the synthesis of heterogeneous bodies of literature, in which different groups of scientists have conceptualised and investigated the 'same' problem in different ways and produced seemingly contradictory findings. Its contribution to the mixed economy of methods for the systematic review of complex evidence should be explored further. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Purpose - To provide an integrated architecture framework for e-government that represents the alignment of IT infrastructure with business process management in public sector organisations and classify the barriers that might complicate the implementation of the proposed architecture framework. The study will help IT practitioners in the public sector learn how to use and manage information technologies to revitalise business processes, improve decision-making, and gain a competitive advantage from the adoption of e-government. The proposed architecture framework for e-government adoption will reduce confusion surrounding e-government infrastructure in the public sector through understanding the implementation processes, identifying requirements of information and communications technology tools, highlighting the importance of the organisational management resources and the impact of barriers. Design/methodology/approach - A range of earlier studies have been critically examined and analysed to provide an integrated architecture framework for e-government adoption that can address and identify the standards, infrastructure components, applications, and technologies for e-government. The authors have divided the architecture framework into four layers; access layer, e-government layer, e-business layer, and infrastructure layer; each layer addresses a particular aspect of e-government architecture. This paper then presents a critical analysis of barriers experienced in public sector organisations, which prevent the successful adoption of e-government; such barriers being presented in a taxonomy. Findings - Defined organisational and technological requirements that will be necessary for the adoption of e-government in public sector organisations through construct an integrated architecture framework for e-government. The difficulties and barriers that have been experienced in public sector organisations which complicate the implementation process of e-government have been analysed and then identified and presented in a taxonomy. Originality/value - The paper provides architecture framework for e-government adoption that can help to guide IT managers recognise the technological and organisational requirements for e-government adoption in public sector organisations. The framework can also help the decision makers to set a vision statement and strategic action plan for future direction in the information technology age through identifying key elements and stages for action. The authors also identify and classify the perceived barriers that might complicate the implementation process of e-government projects. The awareness of these barriers is important for any e-government project since they will alert the e-government project team with any problems or challenges might be existed during the implementation process so they will be ready to overcome them. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

In addition, this environment encourages collaboration and breaking down walls of information asymmetries between various stakeholders.

Quantitative results from public sector innovation awards indicate that bottomup innovation occurs much more frequently than conventional wisdom would indicate. Effective political leadership in a crisis requires decision making that employs a wide search for information, broad consultation, and skeptical examination of a wide range of options. Successful leadership of a turnaround requires an agency head to regain political confidence, reach out to stakeholders and clients, and to convince dispirited staff that change is possible and that their efforts to do better will be supported. Political leaders and agency heads can create a supportive climate for bottomup innovation by consulting staff, instituting formal awards and informal recognition for innovators, promoting innovators, protecting innovators from controloriented central agencies, and publicly championing bottomup innovations that have proven successful and have popular appeal. {\textcopyright} 2002, MCB UP Limited},

This implies a mismatch between the ways ‘experts' and decision-makers conceive and plan transitional housing and the ways people perceive, experience and use them. This paper explores the use of a housing pathways framework to improve our understanding of the multiple ways in which transitional housing is perceived, experienced and used by disaster-affected people in low-income cities. For illustrating this point, we focus on the case of the city of Sarpol-e Zahab in Iran that was struck by an earthquake measuring 7.3 on the Richter scale in 2017. The paper relies on a fieldwork study conducted in 2017–2018 in the city. This case provides a number of insights, in particular given that the state programs provided two options of cash grant and pre-fabricated units to households for transitional housing. In addition to reporting transitional housing activities in the city, we show that the four identified housing pathways in this city account for pre- and post-earthquake structural forces as well as households' own choices and strategies for adaptation. Highlighting how households' post-disaster trajectories were influenced by different aspects of post-disaster policies and interventions, the paper concludes with some recommendations for transitional housing programs in the context of lower-income cities.},

abstract = {Rapid increase in population and growing concentration of capital in urban areas has escalated both the severity and longer-term impact of natural disasters. As a result, Disaster Risk Management (DRM) and reduction have been gaining increasing importance for urban areas. Remote sensing plays a key role in providing information for urban DRM analysis due to its agile data acquisition, synoptic perspective, growing range of data types, and instrument sophistication, as well as low cost. As a consequence numerous methods have been developed to extract information for various phases of DRM analysis. However, given the diverse information needs, only few of the parameters of interest are extracted directly, while the majority have to be elicited indirectly using proxies. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the proxies developed for two risk elements typically associated with pre-disaster situations (vulnerability and resilience), and two post-disaster elements (damage and recovery), while focusing on urban DRM. The proxies were reviewed in the context of four main environments and their corresponding sub-categories: built-up (buildings, transport, and others), economic (macro, regional and urban economics, and logistics), social (services and infrastructures, and socio-economic status), and natural. All environments and the corresponding proxies are discussed and analyzed in terms of their reliability and sufficiency in comprehensively addressing the selected DRM assessments. We highlight strength and identify gaps and limitations in current proxies, including inconsistencies in terminology for indirect measurements. We present a systematic overview for each group of the reviewed proxies that could simplify cross-fertilization across different DRM domains and may assist the further development of methods. While systemizing examples from the wider remote sensing domain and insights from social and economic sciences, we suggest a direction for developing new proxies, also potentially suitable for capturing functional recovery.},

The humanitarian sector tends to favour rebuilding in-place to avoid the social disruptions of mass relocation, yet evidence on what affected people want is mixed. Using the case of post-tsunami Banda Aceh, Indonesia, we investigate whether a policy to rebuild in-place in the disaster-affected area suits an urban population that was previously unaware of the hazard. We show that following the tsunami, a substantial proportion of the population prefers to live farther from the coast. This has caused a new price premium for inland properties and socio-economic sorting of poorer households into coastal areas. These findings show that offering reconstruction aid predominantly within a hazard-exposed area can inadvertently transfer disaster risk to the poor.},

Those who experience climate-and weather-related disasters rarely respond as a homogenous group of migrants, yet relatively limited studies have specifically examined individual-level heterogeneities across those exposed. In this paper, we used self-reported data to investigate differences in sociodemographics (age, marital status, sex, and education) between those who relocated after environmental disruptions in Indonesia and those who did not relocate. Individuals with 12 years of education at the time of an environmental exposure were 3.93 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.38, 11.20) times more likely to move for environmental reasons than those with <12 years of education. Assuming education as a proxy for socioeconomic status, these findings suggest that those in the mid-range socioeconomic brackets may be most likely to migrate after environmental disruptions, while the poorest are less likely to move. This may reflect that the costs of relocation are prohibitively high for those with lower socioeconomic status. Collectively, these results add to an inconsistent body of literature on environmental mobility and indicate that further site-and context-specific research on climate-and weather-related relocation is needed.},

abstract = {Recent tsunami have caused massive loss of life, destruction of coastal infrastructures and disruption to economic activity. To date, tsunami hazard studies have concentrated on determining the frequency and magnitude of events and in the production of simplistic flood maps. In general, such maps appear to have assumed a uniform vulnerability of population, infrastructure and business. In reality however, a complex set of factors interact to produce a pattern of vulnerability that varies spatially and temporally. A new vulnerability assessment approach is described, that incorporates multiple factors (e.g. parameters relating to the natural and built environments and socio-demographics) that contribute to tsunami vulnerability. The new methodology is applied on a coastal segment in Greece and, in particular, in Crete, west of the city of Herakleio. The results are presented within a Geographic Information System (GIS). The application of GIS ensures the approach is novel for tsunami studies, since it permits interrogation of the primary database by several different end-users. For example, the GIS may be used: (1) to determine immediate post-tsunami disaster response needs by the emergency services; (2) to pre-plan tsunami mitigation measures by disaster planners; (3) as a tool for local planning by the municipal authorities or; (4) as a basis for catastrophe modelling by insurance companies. We show that population density varies markedly with the time of the year and that 30% of buildings within the inundation zone are only single story thus increasing the vulnerability of their occupants. Within the high inundation depth zone, 11% of buildings are identified as in need of reinforcement and this figure rises to 50% within the medium inundation depth zone. 10% of businesses are located within the high inundation depth zone and these may need to consider their level of insurance cover to protect against primary building damage, contents loss and business interruption losses. {\textcopyright} European Geosciences Union 2003.},

Applications: This study was conducted in the Semarang coastal area, which is simultaneously prone to three disasters, i.e., sea level rise, land subsidence, and tidal inundation. The study shows that staying decision-making was taken in household units. The staying decision-making process consists of interactions between four components: availability of options, motives, expectations, and incentives. Results: Exploring the decision to stay is an opportunity to understand migration processes in a new way.

abstract = {Due to China's exposure and susceptibility to natural hazards, it is important for governments and aid agencies to have tools that enable effective post-disaster livelihood recovery in creating self-sufficiency for the affected population. This paper introduces a framework of critical components that constitute a successful livelihood recovery by studying the perceptions and perspectives of those affected by the 2013 Lushan earthquake in Sichuan Province. A mixed method, namely a pilot study, questionnaire survey and interviews, was used. While the populations surveyed valued the employment benefits of creating new market and economic sectors in areas where rural farming was predominant prior to the earthquake, they considered that recovery of their housing was most essential for livelihood diversification. External assistance was also regarded highly in assisting with livelihood recovery, in which family ties and social connections seemed to have played a larger role than that of government agencies and NGOs. Lastly, the results highlighted that a goal of livelihood recovery cannot be achieved without individual well-being being considered, in relation to people's perceptions about quality of life and their physical and mental health. This paper aims to assist the Chinese policy makers and practitioners in disaster recovery in setting an agenda of preparing for livelihood recovery in peace times, or of post-disaster recovery planning should a disaster event occurs so that the economic impact and livelihood burdens of those affected can be effectively mitigated.},

abstract = {The 26 December 2004 earthquake and tsunami unfairly hit the different ethnic groups of Aceh, Indonesia. About 170,000 Acehnese and Minangkabau people died in the Northern tip of Sumatra while only 44 Simeulue people passed away in the neighbouring Simeulue island located near the earthquake epicentre. Such a difference in the death toll does not lie in the nature of the hazard but in different human behaviours and ethnic contexts. The present study draws on a contextual framework of analysis where people's behaviour in the face of natural hazards is deeply influenced by the cultural, social, economic and political context. Questionnaire-based surveys among affected communities, key informant interviews and literature reviews show that the people of Simeulue detected the tsunami very early and then escaped to the mountains. On the other hand, Acehnese and Minangkabau people, respectively in the cities of Banda Aceh and Meulaboh, did not anticipate the phenomenon and were thus caught by the waves. The different behaviours of the victims have been commanded by the existence or the absence of a disaster subculture among affected communities as well as by their capacity to protect themselves in facing the tsunami. People's behaviours and the capacity to protect oneself can be further tracked down to a deep tangle of intricate factors which include the armed conflict that has been affecting the province since the 1970s, the historical and cultural heritage and the national political economy system. This paper finally argues that the uneven impact of the 26 December 2004 earthquake and tsunami in Aceh lies in the different daily life conditions of the ethnic groups struck by the disaster. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.},

abstract = {The accurate delineation of flood hazard maps is a key element of flood risk management policy. Flood inundation models are fundamental for reproducing the boundaries of flood-prone areas, but their calibration is limited to the information available on the areas affected by inundation during observed flood events (typically fragmentary photo, video or partial surveys). In recent years, Earth Observation data have supported flood monitoring and emergency response (e.g., the Copernicus Emergency Service) thanks to the proliferation of available satellite sensors, also at high spatial resolution. Under this umbrella, the study investigates a levee breach that occurred in December 2017 along the Enza River, a right tributary of the Po River, that caused the inundation of a large area including Lentigione village. The flood event is simulated with a 2D hydraulic model using satellite images to calibrate the roughness coefficients. The results show that the processing and the timing of the high-resolution satellite imagery is fundamental for a reliable representation of the flooded area.},

abstract = {Estimates of the cost of potential disasters, including indirect economic consequences, are an important input in the design of risk management strategies. The adaptive regional input-output (ARIO) inventory model is a tool to assess indirect disaster losses and to analyze their drivers. It is based on an input-output structure, but it also (i) explicitly represents production bottlenecks and input scarcity and (ii) introduces inventories as an additional flexibility in the production system. This modeling strategy distinguishes between (i) essential supplies that cannot be stocked (e.g., electricity, water) and whose scarcity can paralyze all economic activity; (ii) essential supplies that can be stocked at least temporarily (e.g., steel, chemicals), whose scarcity creates problems only over the medium term; and (iii) supplies that are not essential in the production process, whose scarcity is problematic only over the long run and are therefore easy to replace with imports. The model is applied to the landfall of Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana and identifies two periods in the disaster aftermath: (1) the first year, during which production bottlenecks are responsible for large output losses; (2) the rest of the reconstruction period, during which bottlenecks are inexistent and output losses lower. This analysis also suggests important research questions and policy options to mitigate disaster-related output losses. {\textcopyright} 2013 Society for Risk Analysis.},

In this paper, the optimum allocation of the medical assistance to the injured according to a multi-criteria decision making is performed by Multiplicatively Weighted Network Voronoi Diagram (MWNVD). For consideration of the allocation of the injured in the affected area to the appropriate hospitals using the MWNVD and decreasing the gap between the estimated and expected population in the MWNVDs, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is applied to the MWNVDs. This paper proposes a multi agent-based modeling for incorporating the allocation of the medical supplies to the injured according to the generated Voronoi Diagrams of the PSO-MWNVD, wayfinding of emergency vehicles based on the minimum travel distance and time as well as using smart city facilities to expedite the rescue operation. In the proposed model, considering the priority of the injured for receiving the medical assistance, information transfer about the condition of the injured to the hospitals prior to ambulance arrival for providing appropriate treatment, updating of emergency vehicles route based on the blocked streets and etc. are optimized. The partial difference between the estimated and expected population for receiving the medical assistance in MWNVDs is computed as 37%, while the PSO-MWNVD decreased the mentioned difference to 6%. The relief operation time in the proposed model compared to another multi-agent rescue operation model, which uses MWNVD and does not have some facilities of the proposed model, is improved.},

Disaster management is a challenging problem because while information needs to be processed in real time, the damaged environment can prevent it from being disseminated to processing centres. Our goal is to exploit available technologies such as Wireless Sensor Network (WSNs) and Vehicular Ad hoc NETworks (VANETs) to forward alerts from victims to rescue services. We propose an opportunistic data dissemination protocol (3DMAT) for disaster management in which both WSNs and VANETs participate in decision-making for the dissemination process so that messages are delivered in a timely manner. The simulation results show that the proposed protocol performs data dissemination more efficiently than other protocols. 3DMAT calculates the quality of nodes and the link between them to select the most relevant relay. Our protocol is 47% faster and generates a 17% lower communication load and 14% fewer redundant messages. These improvements are due to a selection strategy that targets the most relevant nodes to relay information.},

abstract = {Wind-induced damages on leaning poles cause a large amount of losses and disruption to community functioning and interdependent infrastructure systems such as power networks. In order to reduce and prevent failure of utility poles in extreme weather events, traditional inspection techniques have been used to understand a condition of utility poles. Because of (1) uncertain detection rate depending on inspectors' visual observation skills and (2) labor-intensive process to inspect large-scale poles, camera-equipped drones have been leveraged to capture image data for reducing human errors as well as inspection time and increasing the number of inspections. Despite the benefits, prior works mainly focused on accurate detection and classification of utility poles, rather than pole inspection and maintenance through visual analytics. This paper presents a novel method to stream vision-based pole inspection information (i.e., maximum leaning angle of poles) into a virtual environment toward digital twin modeling in the context of power distribution infrastructure systems. By leveraging a single 2D image per pole obtained from a drone, the maximum leaning angle of utility poles over large areas are estimated. The outcomes of vision-based utility pole analysis are then fed into a virtual environment. For evaluation, case studies were conducted on Bryan, TX. The resulting digital twin model representing the stability information of utility poles has the potential to be used as a basis for better designing disaster preparedness and hazard mitigation strategies regarding the preventive maintenance of power distribution networks.},

The method used was analyzing concepts related to smart cities and SWM applications in the world and Indonesia. Based on the results of the analysis of the abovementioned concepts, several conclusions were obtained, namely that an SWM support system is indispensable in water system management, leak detection, and water quality monitoring. Then, a smart water grid is used to develop control over water resources, infrastructure, and water discharge with high efficiency and sustainability. The flood early warning system must be utilized to minimize losses or victims caused by flood disasters. In addition, an online water quality monitoring system is needed to monitor water quality online and in real time. The integrated implementation of the smart city and SWM concepts described in the paper is expected to produce safe, healthy, and sustainable drinking water services.},

To cater to this, there is a need to develop and implement real-time flood management systems that could instantly detect flooded regions to initiate relief activities as early as possible. Current imaging systems, relying on satellites, have demonstrated low accuracy and delayed response, making them unreliable and impractical to be used in emergency responses to natural disasters such as flooding. This research employs Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to develop an automated imaging system that can identify inundated areas from aerial images. The Haar cascade classifier was explored in the case study to detect landmarks such as roads and buildings from the aerial images captured by UAVs and identify flooded areas. The extracted landmarks are added to the training dataset that is used to train a deep learning algorithm. Experimental results show that buildings and roads can be detected from the images with 91% and 94% accuracy, respectively. The overall accuracy of 91% is recorded in classifying flooded and non-flooded regions from the input case study images. The system has shown promising results on test images belonging to both pre-and post-flood classes. The flood relief and rescue workers can quickly locate flooded regions and rescue stranded people using this system. Such real-time flood inundation systems will help transform the disaster management systems in line with modern smart cities initiatives.},

The earthquake had caused damage to about half a million private and public buildings, apart from damage to other infrastructures including schools, hospitals, roads, hydropower, irrigation canals, etc. The earthquake had affected the lives of 8 million people. With significant numbers of actors and stakeholders involved in the reconstruction process, no significant relief has reached the ground or is observable even after 3 years of the disaster. The government has formed National Reconstruction Authority (NRA) as the focal authority for the reconstruction process which is leading the reconstruction process with line agencies and other stakeholders. The longitudinal study was carried out through semi-structured interviews with the engineers working under NRA, local people and social mobilizer, group discussions, and field observation from June 2015 to August 2016 focusing on challenges for timely and quality reconstruction. The research also reviews the experiences from past events in similar social and political condition. This study concludes that the situation was the result of larger institutional gaps as the absence of local government, lack of coordination, bureaucratic hurdles and political transition, weak governance and cross-cutting issues as accessibility, manpower shortage, knowledge gap and other socio-cultural aspects. Authors supplement that the good governance and strategic incorporation of social and cultural aspects of reconstructions along with the technical cross-cutting issues like skilled labour, resources availability and construction knowledge could help to expedite the reconstruction process.},

In this study, in relation to the field damage investigation of the earthquake hit area and based on the building types, different types of building waste produced from each building are estimated and evaluated. An estimation procedure was established to assess the amount of debris resulting from earthquake. In Kathmandu Valley, different types of buildings generated different quantities of building waste per unit area, and the values for these building types ranged from 1.90 to 3.23 ton m− 2 in weight and 0.89 to 1.57 m3 m− 2 in volume respectively. Residential buildings in Nepal generated a larger amount of waste per unit area (ton m− 2) than buildings in Japan and China. Waste amounts (excluding that in the foundation) generated by public reinforced concrete buildings in Nepal were similar to the amounts generated by reinforced concrete buildings in Japan and China. Wooden buildings had the highest volume per unit area of building waste in Japan, as compared to those in Nepal and Sri Lanka. These results can be used to estimate the amount of building debris that must be cleared for emergency response after a disaster.

abstract = {Systemic risks are characterized by high complexity, multiple uncertainties, major ambiguities, and transgressive effects on other systems outside of the system of origin. Due to these characteristics, systemic risks are overextending established risk management and create new, unsolved challenges for policymaking in risk assessment and risk governance. Their negative effects are often pervasive, impacting fields beyond the obvious primary areas of harm. This article addresses these challenges of systemic risks from different disciplinary and sectorial perspectives. It highlights the special contributions of these perspectives and approaches and provides a synthesis for an interdisciplinary understanding of systemic risks and effective governance. The main argument is that understanding systemic risks and providing good governance advice relies on an approach that integrates novel modeling tools from complexity sciences with empirical data from observations, experiments, or simulations and evidence-based insights about social and cultural response patterns revealed by quantitative (e.g., surveys) or qualitative (e.g., participatory appraisals) investigations. Systemic risks cannot be easily characterized by single numerical estimations but can be assessed by using multiple indicators and including several dynamic gradients that can be aggregated into diverse but coherent scenarios. Lastly, governance of systemic risks requires interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral cooperation, a close monitoring system, and the engagement of scientists, regulators, and stakeholders to be effective as well as socially acceptable.},

abstract = {Ripple effect is a specific area of SC disruptions and a strong stressor to SC resilience. Research on the ripple effect analyses how one or more disruptive events propagate through the SC and impact its resilience and performance. The phenomenon of the ripple effect, immensely existing in practice, has received great research interest in recent years. Ripple effect management, modelling and assessment became visible research avenues with a growing number and scope of contributions. This Special Issue presents recent developments on the ripple effect in SCs. The Special Issue focuses on studies that address the ripple effect and provide a comprehensive picture of the state of the art and future perspectives. The methodologies comprise of mathematical optimisation, simulation, game theory, control theoretic, data-driven analytics, network complexity, reliability theory research, and empirical research. Even though a variety of valuable insights have been developed in this area in recent years, new research avenues and ripple effect taxonomies are identified for further exploring the ripple effect in the settings of the COVID-19 pandemic, SC viability, viable SC model, and reconfigurable SCs.},

The integration of big data analytics and artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI-ML) techniques with digital twinning, further enriches its significance and research potential with new opportunities and unique challenges. To date, a number of scientific models have been designed and implemented related to this evolving topic. However, there is no systematic review of digital twinning, particularly focusing on the role of AI-ML and big data, to guide the academia and industry towards future developments. Therefore, this article emphasizes the role of big data and AI-ML in the creation of digital twins (DTs) or DT-based systems for various industrial applications, by highlighting the current state-of-the-art deployments. We performed a systematic review on top of multidisciplinary electronic bibliographic databases, in addition to existing patents in the field. Also, we identified development-tools that can facilitate various levels of the digital twinning. Further, we designed a big data driven and AI-enriched reference architecture that leads developers to a complete DT-enabled system. Finally, we highlighted the research potential of AI-ML for digital twinning by unveiling challenges and current opportunities.},

The reduced efficiency of response to natural hazards and disasters can extend the time that electrical service is not available for critical end-use loads, and in extreme events, leave the public without power for extended periods. This article presents a methodology for the development of a semantic data model for power systems and the integration of electrical grid topology, population, and electric distribution line reliability indices into a unified, cloud-based, serverless framework that supports power system operations in response to extreme events. An iterative and pragmatic approach to working with large and disparate datasets of different formats and types resulted in improved application runtime and efficiency, which is important to consider in real time decision-making processes during hurricanes and similar catastrophic events. This technology was developed initially for Puerto Rico, following extreme hurricane and earthquake events in 2017 and 2020, but is applicable to utilities around the world. Given the highly abstract and modular design approach, this technology is equally applicable to any geographic region and similar natural hazard events. In addition to a review of the requirements, development, and deployment of this framework, technical aspects related to application performance and response time are highlighted.},

As intelligent technology has injected new vitality into emergency management, applying intelligent technology to optimize emergency resource allocation (ERA) has become a focus of research in the post-epidemic era. Based on China's experience in preventing and controlling COVID-19, this paper first analyzes the characteristics and process of ERA in public health emergencies, and then synthesizes the relevant Chinese studies in recent years to identify the intelligent technologies affecting ERA in China using word frequency analysis technology. We also construct an intelligent emergency resource allocation mechanism in four areas: medical intelligence, management intelligence, decision-making intelligence, and supervision intelligence. Finally, we use the entropy-TOPSIS method to evaluate the impact of intelligent technologies on ERA, and we rank the criticality of intelligent technologies. The experimental results show that (i.) medical intelligence and management intelligence are the keys to developing intelligent ERA, and (ii.) among the identified essential intelligent technologies, artificial intelligence (AI), and big data technology have a more significant and critical role in emergency resource intelligence allocation.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers. Understanding the recovery phase of the disaster cycle is still in its infancy. A thorough grasp of recovery can lead to effective postdisaster planning, which is essential for enabling communities to recover quickly from natural and human-made catastrophes. Recent major disasters such as Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina have revealed the inability of existing policies and planning to promptly restore infrastructure, residential properties, and commercial activities in affected communities. While many studies examined the macroeconomic effects of certain policies on overall recovery, very few, if any, have focused on modeling the housing recovery decisions of households and their contributions to the community's recovery. The reestablishment of housing is a crucial parameter in understanding recovery processes because it has a ripple effect on the overall timing of recovery. The objective of this study is to create a model capable of predicting postdisaster housing recovery decisions founded on the data that was collected in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. The collected data encompassed a wide range of internal and external attributes, including demographic, socioeconomic, exposure parameters, and the effect of external signals such as public policies and spatial activities that can affect household's housing recovery decisions. Based on these variables, 23 predictors were chosen. A statistical analysis was performed using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and the results highlighted the significance of insurance reimbursements, tenure, and financial assistance from federal, state, and local organizations. Furthermore, the analysis revealed the marginal significance of three other predictors including habitability of residence posthurricane, accessibility to families, and marital status on housing recovery decisions to either rebuild, repair, or relocate. Finally, the scalability of the model to predict housing recovery decisions is presented through a case study of the Midland Beach and New Dorp Beach neighborhoods.},

abstract = {Natural disaster risk assessments typically consider environmental hazard and physical damage, neglecting to quantify how asset losses affect households' well-being. However, for a given asset loss, a wealthy household might quickly recover, while a poor household might suffer major, long-lasting impacts. This research proposes a methodology to quantify disaster impacts more equitably by integrating the three pillars of sustainability: environmental (hazard and asset damage), economic (macro-economic changes in production and employment) and social (disaster recovery at the household level). The model innovates by assessing the impacts of disasters on people's consumption, considering asset losses and changes in income, among other factors. We apply the model to a hypothetical earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area, considering the differential impact of consumption loss on households of varying wealth. The analysis reveals that poorer households suffer 19% of the asset losses but 41% of the well-being losses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the effectiveness of specific policies varies across cities (depending on their built environment and social and economic profiles) and income groups.},

abstract = {We focus on the role that community plays in the continuum of disaster preparedness, response and recovery, and we explore where community fits in conceptual frameworks concerning disaster decision-making. We offer an overview of models developed in the literature as well as insights drawn from research related to Hurricane Katrina. Each model illustrates some aspect of the spectrum of disaster preparedness and recovery, beginning with risk perception and vulnerability assessments, and proceeding to notions of resiliency and capacity building. Concepts like social resilience are related to theories of "social capital," which stress the importance of social networks, reciprocity, and interpersonal trust. These allow individuals and groups to accomplish greater things than they could by their isolated efforts. We trace two contrasting notions of community to Tocqueville. On the one hand, community is simply an aggregation of individual persons, that is, a population. As individuals, they have only limited capacity to act effectively or make decisions for themselves, and they are strongly subject to administrative decisions that authorities impose on them. On the other hand, community is an autonomous actor, with its own interests, preferences, resources, and capabilities. This definition of community has also been embraced by community-based participatory researchers and has been thought to offer an approach that is more active and advocacy oriented. We conclude with a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of community in disaster response and in disaster research. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Due to the inadequate capacity of Routine Health Information Systems (RHIS), many developing countries face a lack of quality pre-disaster health-related data and efficient post-disaster data processes in the immediate aftermath of a disaster. Considering the significance of local capacity during the early stages of disaster response, RHIS at local, provincial/state and national levels need to be strengthened so that they provide relief personnel up-to-date information to plan, organize and monitor immediate relief activities. RHIS professionals should be aware of specific information needs in disaster response (according to the Sphere Project's Humanitarian Minimum Standards) and requirements in data processes to fulfil those information needs. Preparing RHIS for disasters can be guided by key RHIS-strengthening frameworks; and disaster preparedness must be incorporated into countries' RHIS. Mechanisms must be established in non-disaster times and maintained between RHIS and information systems of non-health sectors for exchanging disaster-related information and sharing technologies and cost. {\textcopyright} The Author 2012; all rights reserved.},

Furthermore, this study develops a measurement scale to quantify damage and recovery appropriate for the available resources. In particular, the study focuses on the development of a methodological approach to tracking housing and tourism resource recovery and helping local communities recover faster the damaged areas after disaster. The effort uses multiple sources of data, including questionnaire data, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) damage data, airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, and remote sensing satellite images. The data are quantitatively analyzed to fulfill the objectives of assessing housing recovery rate over time and are represented on maps. The maps are used to represent the status of damaged buildings (e.g., no damage, minor or major damage, affected or destroyed). Furthermore, repaired buildings in specified time intervals are represented on the maps. Eventually, this study develops two schematic diagrams illustrating the average damage and the weighed recovery from multiple data sources. The outcomes of this study will help decision makers emphasize on the locations identified as experiencing differential progress in the reconstruction, rebuilding, and repairing of houses or tourism resources.},

With the increasing availability of satellite imagery and other remote sensing data, deep learning algorithms can be used and trained to detect, classify, and segment flood regions in real time. In addition, deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been successful in this field, enabling the automated analysis of vast amounts of satellite imagery. By combining AI-based flood detection with other data sources, such as meteorological forecasts and ground-based sensors, comprehensive flood monitoring systems that provide early warning of flood events and facilitate effective emergency response can be developed. In this article, we developed an image-based flood segmentation system called DeepLab that uses a deep learning algorithm to detect and segment the presence and extent of floods with high accuracy and speed. The neural network was trained on an extensive collection of satellite images, which were complemented by ground truth labels that indicated the presence of flooded areas. The trained DeepLabv3 model is applied to new satellite images during inference to forecast the likelihood of each pixel belonging to a flooded area. To do this, a binary flood map was generated from the pixel-level forecasts by incorporating a threshold into the output probabilities. The proposed system's accuracy was high compared to the state-of-the-art methods, as evidenced by segmentation and experimental results. The segmentation accuracy achieved an overall score of 87%.},

Traditional fire detection methods have limitations in terms of accuracy and speed, making it challenging to detect fires in real time. This paper proposes an improved fire detection approach for smart cities based on the YOLOv8 algorithm, called the smart fire detection system (SFDS), which leverages the strengths of deep learning to detect fire-specific features in real time. The SFDS approach has the potential to improve the accuracy of fire detection, reduce false alarms, and be cost-effective compared to traditional fire detection methods. It can also be extended to detect other objects of interest in smart cities, such as gas leaks or flooding. The proposed framework for a smart city consists of four primary layers: (i) Application layer, (ii) Fog layer, (iii) Cloud layer, and (iv) IoT layer. The proposed algorithm utilizes Fog and Cloud computing, along with the IoT layer, to collect and process data in real time, enabling faster response times and reducing the risk of damage to property and human life. The SFDS achieved state-of-the-art performance in terms of both precision and recall, with a high precision rate of 97.1% for all classes.

Instead of visualizing individual updates, an integrated spatiotemporal map yields ‘big picture' event information. We investigate the question of whether information from affected citizens is sufficient to generate a map of an unfolding natural disaster. We built the Citizen Disaster Reaction Multi-Agent Simulation (CDR-MAS), a multi-agent system that simulates the reaction of citizens to a natural disaster in an urban region. We proposed an rkNN classification algorithm to aggregate the update streams into a series of colored Voronoi event maps. We simulated the 2018 Montecito Creek mudslide and customized the CDR-MAS with the local environment to systematically generate stream data sets. Our experimental evaluation showed that event mapping based on citizen update streams is significantly influenced by the amount of citizen participation and movement. Compared with a baseline of 100% participation, with 40% citizen participation, the event region was predicted with 40% accuracy, showing that citizen update streams can provide timely information in a smart city.},

abstract = {The occurrence of forest fires can impact vegetation in the ecosystem, property, and human health but also indirectly affect the climate. The Joint UK Land Environment Simulator - INteractive Fire and Emissions algorithm for Natural envirOnments (JULES-INFERNO) is a global land surface model, which simulates vegetation, soils, and fire occurrence driven by environmental factors. However, this model incurs substantial computational costs due to the high data dimensionality and the complexity of differential equations. Deep-learning-based digital twins have an advantage in handling large amounts of data. They can reduce the computational cost of subsequent predictive models by extracting data features through reduced-order modelling (ROM) and then compressing the data to a low-dimensional latent space. This study proposes a JULES-INFERNO-based digital twin fire model using ROM techniques and deep learning prediction networks to improve the efficiency of global wildfire predictions. The iterative prediction implemented in the proposed model can use current-year data to predict fires in subsequent years. To avoid the accumulation of errors from the iterative prediction, latent data assimilation (LA) is applied to the prediction process. LA manages to efficiently adjust the prediction results to ensure the stability and sustainability of the prediction. Numerical results show that the proposed model can effectively encode the original data and achieve accurate surrogate predictions. Furthermore, the application of LA can also effectively adjust the bias of the prediction results. The proposed digital twin also runs 500 times faster for online predictions than the original JULES-INFERNO model without requiring high-performance computing (HPC) clusters.},

abstract = {The importance of disaster management is evident by the increasing number of natural and manmade disasters such as Irma and Manchester attacks. The estimated cost of the recent Irma hurricane is believed to be more than 80 billion USD; more importantly, more than 40 lives have been lost and thousands were misplaced. Disaster management plays a key role in reducing the human and economic losses. In our earlier work, we have developed a disaster management system that uses VANET, cloud computing, and simulations to devise city evacuation strategies. In this paper, we extend our earlier work by using deep learning to predict urban traffic behavior. Moreover, we use GPUs to deal with compute intensive nature of deep learning algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply deep learning approach in disaster management. We use real-world open road traffic within a city available through the UK Department for Transport. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning approach in disaster management and correct prediction of traffic behavior in emergency situations.},

We created an inventory of 15,551 landslides with a total area of 90.2 km2 triggered by the 2015 Mw 7.8 (Gorkha) and Mw 7.3 (Dolakha) earthquakes in Nepal, through interpretation of very high resolution satellite images (e.g. WorldView, Pleiades, Cartosat-1 and 2, Resourcesat-2). Our spatial analysis of landslide occurrences with ground acceleration, slope, lithology and surface defomation indicated ubiquitous control of steep slope on landslides with ground acceleration as the trigger. Spatial distribution of landslides shows increasing frequency away from the Gorkha earthquake epicentre up to 130 km towards east, dropping sharply thereafter, which is an abnormal phenomenon of coseismic landslides. Landslides are laterally concentrated in three zones which matches well with the seismic rupture evolution of Gorkha earthquake, as reported through teleseismic measurements.},

This study promotes the methodological setup of a landscape digital twin to establish a multi-disciplinary and multi-scalar hazard overview according to a matrix framework implementable over time and space. The original contribution to the research addresses a holistic vision that combines meaningfully qualitative with quantitative approaches within a multi-hazard framework from the socio-economic perspective. This contribution presents road network risk analysis by exploiting flooding and landslide scenarios. The critical road segments or nodes most vulnerable or impacted by network performance and accessibility can be identified with minimal preprocessing from credible open-source sources. Service maps are used to show the spatial distribution of risk scores for different typologies of points of interest and hazards. Origin-destination matrix graphs display changes in travel time between facilities under various scenarios. Using a risk scores formula to generate risk maps has made it possible to effectively represent the interconnectedness among natural hazards, infrastructure, and socio-economic factors, fostering more resilient decision-making processes. The method's applicability is tested through a case study in northern Italy's Piedmont Region.},

The widespread diffusion of functional networks increases the complexity of interdependent systems and their vulnerability to large-scale disruptions. Although in recent years studies of interconnections and chain effects have improved significantly, cascading phenomena are often associated with the “toppling domino metaphor”, or with high-impact, low-probability events. This paper aimed to support a paradigm shift in the state of the art by proposing a new theoretical approach to cascading events in terms of their root causes and lack of predictability. By means of interdisciplinary theory building, we demonstrate how cascades reflect the ways in which panarchies collapse. We suggest that the vulnerability of critical infrastructure may orientate the progress of events in relation to society's feedback loops, rather than merely being an effect of natural triggers. Our conclusions point to a paradigm shift in the preparedness phase that could include escalation points and social nodes, but that also reveals a brand new field of research for disaster scholars.},

abstract = {A natural hazard-related disaster event often causes a series of secondary disasters, forming a disaster chain. Modeling the evolution of disaster chains in multi-hazard scenarios is crucial for risk governance and urban resilience. However, existing multi-hazard models are limited by complex model design and fixed disaster types, making it impossible to ensure flexible reactions to complex and diverse scenarios. This study presents a disaster management system for disaster model service chain (DMSC) to implement interoperable multi-hazard modeling. To achieve efficient model interaction in the DMSC, a management module is designed to normalize heterogeneous single-hazard models based on disaster system theory and the Open Geospatial Consortium standards, enabling them to be accessible, reusable, and interoperable. The normalized models are then adaptively orchestrated through an orchestration module to establish optimal executable DMSCs for different multi-hazard scenarios. Taking an earthquake disaster chain as a case study, we demonstrate that the disaster management system shows stable and flexible performance for multi-hazard modeling.},

Specifically, six case studies of DTs are compared, illustrating their application, content, technological infrastructure, and priority results. The projects presented provide an overview of the existing DT typologies, focusing on the evaluative/prefigurative use and the limits/potential of the tool in light of the socio-health, climate, and environmental crises. Reflections on DT reveal, on the one hand, its potential role in supporting decision-making and participatory processes and, on the other, the potential utopian trend of data-driven planning encouraged by public-private investments in the smart city/twin city sector. In conclusion, the study underlines the innovative role of DT as a cutting-edge scientific format in the disciplinary framework but highlights that the practical use of the tool is still in an experimental research-action phase. From this theoretical-critical review, it is possible to hypothesise new research paths to implement the realism and application potential of DTs for urban planning and urban governance.},

abstract = {The population density in urban areas is rapidly rising, leading to a constant need for new infrastructure and services for citizens. To reduce the time to implementation and optimise the monetary cost of various solutions, the plans and policies of local authorities and stakeholders would benefit from undergoing a series of virtual stress tests. To this end, prescriptive and predictive technologies are widely adopted to optimise city planning and to understand the urban processes and environment such as air pollution and transportation. Nevertheless, holistic sandboxes tightly integrated with cities are still largely lacking. The city digital twin is a promising concept that provides a tool for exploration of new solutions in a controlled environment before their deployment. The digital twin is a virtual replica of the real city, which collects data from the infrastructure, processes and services using not only the available systems, but also purposely built connected devices and sensors. In this context, the establishment of urban living labs facilitates the monitoring and understanding of urban processes and enriches the digital twin with highly-relevant data. This paper presents an urban living lab, under deployment in the district of Lozenets in Sofia, Bulgaria. It is part of a larger initiative for developing a city digital twin of Sofia to support the design, exploration, and experimentation of different solutions. The living lab is equipped with sensors for monitoring air quality, atmospheric parameters, noise pollution and pedestrian flows. In addition, a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) system is realised as an edge computing facility at one of the busiest intersections of the district. Along with the equipment, the paper describes the architecture and components of the platform for data collection, storage, processing, and visualization. Finally, high-priority studies are presented, and their demographic and economic impact is discussed.},

In this paper, we present an urban digital twin-based decision support approach to empower local communities to rebuild flood resilient communities. The study shows with an urban digital twin consisting of 3D urban data, high-resolution hydrodynamic models, and regulatory data, stakeholders can effectively reduce the uncertainty in making critical rebuilding decisions such as elevating homes and identifying clusters of improvement opportunities such that the most cost-effective rebuilding choices can be made.

abstract = {The past years have witnessed an increasing interest and concern regarding the development of security monitoring and management mechanisms for Critical Infrastructures, due to their vital role in ensuring the availability of many essential services. This task is not easy due to the specific characteristics of such systems, and the natural resistance of Critical Infrastructures operators against actions implying downtime. Digital Twins, as accurate virtual models of physical objects or processes, can provide a faithful environment for security analysis or evaluation of potential mitigation strategies to be deployed in face of specific situations. Nonetheless, their on-premises deployment can be expensive, implying a significant CAPEX whose return will depend on the ability to plan and deploy a suitable support infrastructure, as well as implementing efficient and scalable data collection and processing mechanisms capable of taking advantage of the acquired resources. This paper presents an off-premises approach to design and deploy Digital Twins to secure critical infrastructures, developed in the scope of the ELEGANT project. Such Digital Twins are built using real-time, high fidelity replicas of Programming Logic Controllers, coupled with scalable and efficient data collection processes, supporting the development and validation of Machine Learning models to mitigate security threats like Denial of Service attacks. The validation approach of ELEGANT, which leveraged from the capabilities of the Fed4Fire federated testbeds evaluated the feasibility of using cloudified Digital Twins, thus converting a significant part of the projected CAPEX for the in-premises model into on-demand, pay-as-you-go OPEX, eventually paving the way for the establishment of a DTaaS (Digital Twin as a Service) paradigm. The achieved results demonstrate that the data pipelines providing support for the ELEGANT Digital Twins have low impact in terms of resource usage in Denial of Service and Distributed Denial of Service attack scenarios, when higher volumes of data are generated.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and big data are consistently called upon to analyze and comprehend many facets of modern daily life. AI and ML in particular are widely used in animal husbandry to monitor both the animals and environment around the clock, which leads to a better understanding of animal behavior and distress, disease control and prevention, and effective business decisions for the farmer. One particularly promising area that advances upon AI is digital twin technology, which is currently used to improve efficiencies and reduce costs across multiple industries and sectors. In contrast to a model, a digital twin is a digital replica of a real-world entity that is kept current with a constant influx of data. The application of digital twins within the livestock farming sector is the next frontier and has the potential to be used to improve large-scale precision livestock farming practices, machinery and equipment usage, and the health and well-being of a wide variety of farm animals. The mental and emotional states of animals can be monitored using recognition technology that examines facial features, such as ear postures and eye white regions. Used with modeling, simulation and augmented reality technologies, digital twins can help farmers to build more energy-efficient housing structures, predict heat cycles for breeding, discourage negative behaviors of livestock, and potentially much more. As with all disruptive technological advances, the implementation of digital twin technology will demand a thorough cost and benefit analysis of individual farms. Our goal in this review is to assess the progress toward the use of digital twin technology in livestock farming, with the goal of revolutionizing animal husbandry in the future.},

To build these networks, we analysed interview, field observation and documentation data collected from non-governmental organizations, local governments and communities. A survey questionnaire was also administered to organizations working in selected communities to validate networks. Results from network analysis established that information was the most commonly shared resource by organizations, followed by financial, material and human resources. Government agencies had the highest actor centralities; however, qualitative data suggest that these roles were the result of obligatory consultations by international organizations and lacked legitimacy in practice. Findings further demonstrate that networks become more decentralized over time as actors leave and roles become more established, influenced by short-term expatriate contracts and the termination of United Nations supported cluster coordination. Findings could help organizations strengthen humanitarian response efforts by attending to resource allocation and knowledge sharing with other organizations.},

abstract = {Resilience has become a cornerstone for risk management and disaster reduction. However, it has evolved extensively both etymologically and conceptually in time and across scientific disciplines. The concept has been (re)shaped by the evolution of research and practice efforts. Considered the opposite of vulnerability for a long time, resilience was first defined as the ability to resist, bounce back, cope with, and recover quickly from the impacts of hazards. To avoid the possible return to conditions of vulnerability and exposure to hazards, the notions of post-disaster development, transformation, and adaptation (build back better) and anticipation, innovation, and proactivity (bounce forward) were then integrated. Today, resilience is characterized by a multitude of components and several classifications. We present a selection of 25 components used to define resilience, and an interesting linkage emerges between these components and the dimensions of risk management (prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery), offering a perspective to strengthen resilience through the development of capacities. Despite its potential, resilience is subject to challenges regarding its operationalization, effectiveness, measurement, credibility, equity, and even its nature. Nevertheless, it offers applicability and opportunities for local communities as well as an interdisciplinary look at global challenges.},

abstract = {Worldwide, flooding is probably the number one cause of losses from natural events. No region in the world is safe from being flooded. As the flood risk is a function of the flood hazard, the exposed values and their vulnerability, the increase in flood losses must be attributed to changes in each of these aspects. While flood protection measures may reduce the frequency of inundation losses, appropriate preparedness measures lessen the residual financial risk considerably. Besides public and private measures, insurance is a key factor in reducing the financial risk for individuals, enterprises, and even whole societies. In recent years, the demand for flood insurance has been growing. This is forcing the insurance industry to develop appropriate solutions. At the same time it is vital for the insurers to know the probable maximum losses they might face as the result of an extreme event. {\textcopyright} 2005, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Natural hazard-induced disasters have caused catastrophic damage and loss to buildings, infrastructure, and the affected communities as a whole during the recent decades and their impact is expected to further escalate in the future. Thus, there is a huge demand for disaster risk management using digitalisation as a key enabler for effective and efficient disaster risk management systems. It is widely accepted that digital and intelligence technologies can help solve key aspects of disaster risk management such as disaster prevention and mitigation, and rescue and recovery. Digital Twin (DT) is one of the most promising technologies for multi-stage management which offers significant potential to advance disaster resilience. Smart Cities (SCs) use pervasive information and communications technology to monitor activities in the city. With increasingly large applications of DTs combined with big data generated from sensors in a SC, it is now possible to create Digital Twin Smart Cities (DTSCs). Despite the increasing prevalence of DTSC technologies and their profound impact on disaster risk management, a systematic and longitudinal view of the evolution to the current status of DTSC for disaster risk management does not exist. This review analyses 312 titles and abstracts and 72 full papers. To begin with, a scientific review of DT and SC is undertaken, where the evolution of DTSCs is reviewed. In addition, the intelligence technologies used in DTSCs for disaster risk management are assessed and their benefits are evaluated. Furthermore, the evolution and technical feasibility of DTSC-driven disaster risk management is evaluated by assessing current applications of DTSCs in disaster risk management. It was found that despite the significant potential benefits offered by DTSCs, they also add a new layer of complexities and challenges inherent to these technologies to the already complex web of complexities involved in disaster risk management. These challenges can be addressed by understanding how the process of utilising DTSCs in disaster risk reduction and sustainability is designed, which is essential for comprehending what DTSCs may offer, how it is implemented, and what it means to all involved stakeholders. This paper contributes to the knowledge by improving the understanding of the current status of DTSC technologies and their impact on disaster risk management, and articulating the challenges in implementing DTSC, which inspires the professional community to advance these technologies to address them in future research.},

@article{Fan2020,
abstract = {The objective of this paper is to create and test an integrative framework for performance analysis of disaster management system-of-systems (DM-SoS). Effective disaster management systems and processes are critical for saving lives and protecting properties. However, the lack of integration between heterogeneous systems and entities involved in disaster management impacts coordination and operational efficiency. Greater integration and coordination among multiple heterogeneous entities is essential in improving performance and achieving network-centric disaster management. To address this gap, this paper, first examines the dimensions of analysis and a framework for a system-of-systems assessment of disaster management. In the proposed framework, the main entities include stakeholders, operations, resources, information, and infrastructure. Second, a metanetwork framework was employed to capture the network interactions among various types of entities. Then, measures of network efficiency (e.g., operational and coordination efficiency) were used to identify critical entities and evaluate the effectiveness of system integration strategies. The application of the proposed framework was shown in a case study of disaster management processes in the 2017 Hurricane Harvey. The findings highlight the importance of the SoS approach for evaluating the performance of disaster management processes under different disaster-induced perturbations (e.g., resources limitation, infrastructure disruptions, and lack of information). The findings also identify ways to improve system integration and coordination among various heterogeneous entities interacting in networks.},

abstract = {With the increased accuracy available from state of the art deep learning models and new embedded devices at the edge of the network capable of running and updating these models there is potential for urban intelligence at the edge of the network. The physical proximity of these edge devices will allow for intelligent reasoning one hop away from data generation. This will allow a range of modern urban reasoning applications that require reduced latency and jitter such as remote surgery, vehicle collision detection and augmented reality. The traffic flow from IoT devices to the cloud will also be reduced as with the increased accuracy from deep learning models only a subset of the data will need to be reported after a first pass analysis. However, the training time of deep learning models can be long, taking weeks on multiple desktop GPUs for large datasets. In this paper we show how transfer learning can be used to update the last layers of pre-trained models at the edge of the network, dramatically reducing the training time and allowing the model to perform new tasks without data ever having to be sent to the cloud. This will also improve the users' privacy, which is a key requirement for urban intelligence applications with the introduction of GDPR. We compare our approach to alternative IoT urban intelligence architectures such as cloud-based architectures and deep learning algorithms trained only on local data.},

abstract = {Global warming has been observed for decades, and associated climate change is expected to increase the frequency of rare severe events. In Canada, floods are the costliest climate change-induced disasters. For example, the damage cost due to the 2013 flood in Calgary was around $5 billion. Similar devastating floods occurred in other Canadian regions over the past decade. This demonstrate that the cities in Canada are in need for effective decision support tools that can enable the proper and rapid actions under flood events. However, a city must be replicated either physically or virtually such that the inherited complex nature and interdependence between the city's subsystems are efficiently captured. Emerging technologies, advanced communication systems, and ongoing software development facilitate the virtual representation of a city in a digital twin. This study lays a framework to devise a city digital twin under flood hazards through the integration of data acquisition systems, hydrology and hydraulic modeling, physical infrastructures and entities, demographic information, and real-time system behavior. To demonstrate the applicability and viability of the framework, a digital twin of the city of Calgary is developed and subsequently calibrated using the historical flood that affected the city in 2013. Digital twins developed based on this framework can be employed to: (1) provide a continuous imitation of hazards affecting the city infrastructures; (2) identify vulnerable locations across the city under hazardous events; (3) enhance the city resilience under climate-induced hazards; and (4) develop reliable preparedness plans and risk mitigation strategies under climate-related hazards.},

abstract = {This paper presents a stochastic integer program developed to determine how to schedule inspection, damage assessment, and repair tasks so as to optimize the post-earthquake restoration of the electric power system. The objective of the optimization is to minimize the average time each customer is without power, and a genetic algorithm is used to solve it. The effectiveness of the schedules recommended by the optimization are evaluated by running a detailed discrete event simulation model of the restoration process with both the optimization-generated schedules and the power company's original schedules, and comparing the resulting restorations according to three measures - average time each customer is without power, time required to restore 90% of customers, and time required to restore 98% of customers. The optimization and simulation models both consider all the earthquakes that could affect the power system and represent the uncertainty surrounding expected restoration times. The models were developed through an application to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) electric power system, but the general approach is extendable to other electric power systems, other lifelines, and other hazards.

abstract = {Natural hazards, which have the potential to cause catastrophic damage and loss to infrastructure, have increased significantly in recent decades. Thus, the construction demand for disaster prevention and mitigation for infrastructure (DPMI) systems is increasing. Many studies have applied intelligence technologies to solve key aspects of infrastructure, such as design, construction, disaster prevention and mitigation, and rescue and recovery; however, systematic construction is still lacking. Digital twin (DT) is one of the most promising technologies for multi-stage management which has great potential to solve the above challenges. This paper initially puts forward a scientific concept, in which DT drives the construction of intelligent disaster prevention and mitigation for infrastructure (IDPMI) systematically. To begin with, a scientific review of DT and IDPMI is performed, where the development of DT is summarized and a DT-based life cycle of infrastructures is defined. In addition, the intelligence technologies used in disaster management are key reviewed and their relative merits are illustrated. Furthermore, the development and technical feasibility of DT-driven IDPMI are illustrated by reviewing the relevant practice of DT in infrastructure. In conclusion, a scientific framework of DT-IDPMI is programmed, which not only provides some guidance for the deep integration between DT and IDPMI but also identifies the challenges that inspire the professional community to advance these techniques to address them in future research.},

Drainage design is one of the efforts to prevent floods, however, when the rainfall is high, there are still several inundation points that occur. This requires comprehensive handling to reduce the impact of these inundations, to get an adaptive solution, the use of internet of things based (IoT) tools is one of the alternatives proposed. This study proposes an IoT-based flood inundation monitoring system, which includes a water level reader, a web-based inundation monitoring system, a flood inundation area and depth reporting system as evaluation materials for the government city. The sensor module that we propose is a series of sensors in a hollow cylinder design to reduce water ripples. The server application is displayed in the form of an interactive area mapping which is divided into 4 layers for 4 different analyzes so that central officers can quickly coordinate with field officers to carry out mitigation actions in the affected area. The module requires a low cost and easy installation process compared to a liquid sensor, besides that the display in the form of a web makes it easier for officers to access monitoring applications anywhere compared to geographic information system based (GIS) applications. This research has been carried out and tested in one of the major cities in Indonesia.},

abstract = {Tabriz, a key economic and political hub in Iran, is highly susceptible to a range of natural hazards, particularly earthquakes and landslides. This study develops a multi-hazard risk scenario – combining earthquake, triggered landslides, and their cascading impacts on road transportation – to assess the potential impact of a 7.3 magnitude earthquake on the city's infrastructure and emergency response systems. Using a GIS-based hazard model integrated with demographic and structural data, we analysed the impacts of earthquakes and landslides on road accessibility, mortality rates, and the effectiveness of disaster relief efforts. The findings reveal that Tabriz's emergency response capabilities and main roads, particularly in the northern districts, would be critically impacted by both the earthquake and subsequent landslides, resulting in significant delays in rescue operations and a high loss of life. Up to 30 % of the city's buildings are at risk of collapse, with the most vulnerable populations — including children, women, and low-income communities—facing the greatest risk. The projected death toll could reach 17 %, with casualties rising further if emergency response is delayed. Moreover, areas previously considered relatively safe from seismic risks may still suffer substantial damage due to landslides. This study underscores the urgent need for enhanced disaster planning and response taken into account the cascading effects of earthquake. It also highlights the importance of reinforcing urban planning, upgrading emergency infrastructure, and raising public awareness to mitigate future risks.},

abstract = {Recent disasters have placed enormous pressure on communities to be more resilient. Community resilience encompasses a range of structural, economic, and social dimensions that affect a community's ability to withstand change and disruption from disaster events. In recognition of the social processes that contribute to resilience, governments have increased investment in community engagement programs based on the assumption these programs of activity contribute to community resilience. While several studies identify the indicators of community resilience, few operationalize these indicators for community engagement in a way that can be used to establish baselines and evaluate change overtime. This paper addresses this gap. In-depth interviews with 16 community engagement practitioners in Australia investigated how community resilience in flood prone communities was conceptualized and how the outcomes from engaging communities for resilience building were identified. Findings from the study and the extant literature on resilience empirically informed the development of a four-step pre-engagement approach that extends current community engagement models and supports the measurement of engagement activities and aligned resilient outcomes. The pre-engagement approach can be adapted to diverse community contexts beyond flood emergencies and beyond Australian borders.},

Members of the research team independently reviewed the literature (n = 108 articles) and used thematic analysis to find, examine, interpret, and report repeated patterns. Five main interconnected themes emerged with high inter-rater reliability throughout the analysis, which were: 1) the process is confusing and difficult to navigate; 2) exclusion from or lack of access to political power and recovery decision-making processes; 3) exclusion due to discrimination in its many forms; 4) issues in the funding aid ecosystem; and 5) politicians and media having an inordinate amount of control over the flow of resources and recovery processes. Findings point to a need for greater inclusion of historically marginalized populations throughout the pre-disaster planning and recovery process. These findings provide the basis for actionable recommendations for governments, relief organizations, and other stakeholders on how to address recovery barriers and meet the needs of diverse populations.},

The underlying base of these implementations relies on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can accurately and precisely identify and locate the respective areas of interest within satellite imagery or other forms of remote sensing data, thereby assisting in disaster evaluation, rescue planning, and restoration endeavours. Most CNN-based deep-learning models encounter challenges related to the loss of spatial information and insufficient feature representation. This issue can be attributed to their suboptimal design of the layers that capture multiscale-context information and their failure to include optimal semantic information during the pooling procedures. In the early layers of CNNs, the network encodes elementary semantic representations, such as edges and corners, whereas, as the network progresses toward the later layers, it encodes more intricate semantic characteristics, such as complicated geometric shapes. In theory, it is advantageous for a segmentation network to extract features from several levels of semantic representation. This is because segmentation networks generally yield improved results when both simple and intricate feature maps are employed together. This study comprehensively reviews current developments in deep learning methodologies employed to segment remote sensing images associated with natural disasters. Several popular deep learning models, such as SegNet U-Net, FCNs, FCDenseNet, PSPNet, HRNet, and DeepLab, have exhibited notable achievements in various applications, including forest fire delineation, flood mapping, and earthquake damage assessment. These models demonstrate a high level of efficacy in distinguishing between different land cover types, detecting infrastructure that has been compromised or damaged, and identifying regions that are fire-susceptible to further dangers.},

abstract = {Decades of research have been dedicated to understanding and measuring the capacity of households to face and deal with earthquakes. A reflective-measure model equating household earthquake readiness to preparedness has been adopted assuming the presence of a common factor. However, using instruments with unknown psychometric properties is prevalent, instruments with known psychometric properties are unaligned with the construct, and information on the source of items is missing. This study proposes an alternative theoretical framework based on a causal indicator model equating household earthquake readiness to hazard adjustments applied to earthquakes; investigates the presence of a common factor; and, suggests a new measure constructed following the literature guidelines and based on prior research on household earthquake readiness: Earthquake Adjustments Checklist (EAC). Factor Analysis was used to analyze the data from 921 residents in the Azores, a Portuguese archipelago vulnerable to seismic risk. The final version of the EAC contains 13 items derived from the literature that are congruent with Portuguese household earthquake recommendations and with the supporting construct. These items were formulated to be applicable elsewhere. A four-factor solution was obtained differing from the three postulated dimensions of hazard adjustments. The results showed weak correlations, low commonalities and internal consistency pointing to a common factor that is nonexistent or at least insufficient to explain the variability in the adoption of household earthquake adjustments. Moreover, a weak correlation was found between two factors. These findings have implications for the understanding and measuring of household earthquake readiness and practice.},

abstract = {Highlights: What are the main findings? The large gap between ambitions of Urban Digital Twins (UDTs) and their realized contributions is due to the lack of addressing socio-technical complexities. There is a shift in academic literature toward a socio-technical understanding of UDTs. What are the implications of the main findings? A socio-technical research and development agenda is proposed to bridge this gap: Augmented Urban Planning (AUP). It is necessary to consolidate a socio-technical methdology for development and use of UDTs within urban planning processes. Urban digital twins (UDTs) were first discussed in 2018. Seven years later, we ask: What has been their contribution to urban planning and decision making so far? Here, we systematically review 88 peer-reviewed articles to map and compare UDTs' ambitions with their realized contributions. Our results indicate that despite the vast technical developments, socio-technical challenges have remained largely unaddressed, causing many of UDTs' ambitions to remain unrealized. We identify three categories in these socio-technical challenges: interdisciplinary integration (II), consensual contextualization (CC), and procedural operationalization (PO). Accordingly, we consolidate a socio-technical research and development agenda to realize the ambitions of UDTs for urban planning and decision making: Augmented Urban Planning (AUP).},

abstract = {Risk management is a relatively recent discipline that advocates for the adoption of a risk-based approach in directing and controlling organizations. The ISO Guide 31073:2022, which provides standardized risk management vocabulary and terminology, defines it as a managerial tool that facilitates the direction and control of an organization with regard to risk. Risk management focuses on establishing strategies, policies, and procedures that enable organizations to achieve their objectives while safeguarding and protecting their assets. This leads to the preservation of the value of an organization's critical resources and involves identifying, analyzing, evaluating, and responding appropriately to risk factors, which are inevitable in business life. Effective risk management should not be conducted in isolation or silos, but rather through an enterprise risk management (ERM) approach. ERM is a proactive attempt to manage uncertainties about future outcomes to protect and create value for organizations. Although several studies have examined the historical evolution of risk management, they have primarily focused on specific areas of application, such as financial risk management, supply chain risk management, or project risk management. As a result, there is a lack of comprehensive historical reviews that represent the evolution of risk management as a general concept. The present research aims to fill this literature gap by demonstrating the major milestones in the progression of risk management. This will not only provide a snapshot of risk management development but also an understanding of its significance as a modern discipline that contributes to organizational success. Therefore, this paper does not intend to thoroughly review the risk management literature but rather attempts to historically review the main breakthroughs in this significant field to represent the chronological evolution of risk management.},

To increase the resilience of Chinese rural areas against external dangers, REMC and its driving elements must be effectively categorized and evaluated. This study examines the variations in REMC levels and driving factors across different cities and regions, revealing the spatial distribution patterns and underlying mechanisms. To improve REMC in Chinese rural areas, this research employs the Projection Pursuit Method to assess REMC in 280 cities from 2006 to 2020. Additionally, we identify 22 driving factors and use the Random Forest algorithm from machine learning to analyze their impact on REMC. The analysis is conducted at both national and city levels to compare the influence of various driving factors in different regions. The findings show that China's REMC levels have improved over time, driven by economic growth and the formation of urban clusters. Notably, some underdeveloped regions demonstrate higher REMC levels than more developed areas. The four most significant driving factors identified are rural road density, rural Internet penetration, per capita investment in fixed assets, and the density of township health centers. At the city level, rural Internet penetration and the e-commerce turnover of agricultural products have particularly strong driving effects. Moreover, the importance of driving factors varies across regions due to local conditions. This study offers valuable insights for the Chinese government to enhance REMC through region-specific strategies tailored to local circumstances.},

The domain researchers have attempted to understand the attributes of a meaningful and effective collaboration with citizens and improve the quality of engagement accordingly. With this aim, a rich and extensive literature has been created, covering different aspects of citizen engagement. The subjective-ness and context-sensitivity of involved issues, however, do not allow for a ‘universal' standard solution to be proposed, even to a similar problem, in different spatiotemporal contexts. In this paper, after an extensive analysis of a broadly inclusive range of existing literature through more than 1092 publications, a conceptual framework is proposed to contextualize citizen engagement in urban projects. Using this framework, a model is trained, with the aid of the fuzzy paradigm to provide fuzzy sets of most relevant keywords for a query regarding citizen engagement in urban projects, and a decision support system is developed to retrieve the most relevant publications, based on the fuzzy inference mechanism. The system provides the most relevant keywords for reviewing the literature, as well as the most related documents, through answering a set of simple questions. The solution is deployed through a user interface, linked to the well-known Elsevier online database Scopus. The developed system can assist researchers and practitioners with retrieving knowledge from the literature, for setting up new projects.},

The literature gives two dimensions of open government aims: innovation objectives (high or low) and managerial level (political versus administrative). The results of our survey with 168 participants revealed different motivations for participation in open government projects related to three objectives of open government projects: collaborative democracy, citizen sourcing, and citizen ideation & innovation. We found indications that socio-economic characteristics of citizens do not influence the willingness to participate in open government projects-contrary to findings in other forms of government participation-and therefore open government opens a great potential for enlarged citizen engagement. Our survey also indicates that open government projects with lower ambitions result in more participation than more ambitious projects, which implies that considerable steps need to be taken to realize the full potential of open government.},

Moreover, the model for e-government and Web site satisfaction incorporates citizen perspectives on electronic transaction, transparency, and interactivity. Using data obtained from the Council on Excellence in Government, we then develop and test a two-stage multiple-equation model that simultaneously predicts experience, satisfaction, and trust. Findings indicate that government Web site use is positively associated with e-government satisfaction and Web site satisfaction and that e-government satisfaction is positively associated with trust in government. We also find that while citizens are generally satisfied with the electronic provision of information (transparency), there is some dissatisfaction with the transaction and interactivity of Web sites. We conclude that electronic government strategies - transaction, transparency, and interactivity - are important factors that directly affect e-government satisfaction and indirectly affect trust. Individuals who use government Web sites are not only critical consumers but also demanding citizens. {\textcopyright} 2005 Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory, Inc.; all rights reserved.},

abstract = {Electronic government is being increasingly recognized as a means for transforming public governance. Despite this increasing interest, information systems (IS) literature is mostly silent on what really contributes to the success of e-government Web sites. To fill this gap, this study examines the role of trust in e-government success using the updated DeLone and McLean IS success model as the theoretical framework. The model is tested via a survey of 214 Singapore e-government Web site users. The results show that trust in government, but not trust in technology, is positively related to trust in e-government Web sites. Further, trust in e-government Web sites is positively related to information quality, system quality, and service quality. The quality constructs have different effects on "intention to continue" using the Web site and "satisfaction" with the Web site. Post hoc analysis indicates that the nature of usage (active versus passive users) may help us better understand the interrelationships among success variables examined in this study. This result suggests that the DeLone and McLean model can be further extended by examining the nature of IS use. In addition, it is important to consider the role of trust as well as various Web site quality attributes in understanding e-government success. {\textcopyright} 2009 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.},

E-government has been proposed as a way to increase citizen trust in government and improve citizen evaluations of government generally. Using two-stage models to analyze recent Pew survey data, this research explores the relationship between e-government use, attitudes about e-government, and trust in government. There is a statistically significant relationship between trust and use of a local government Web site, as well as other positive assessments of federal and local governments. The evidence suggests that e-government can increase process-based trust by improving interactions with citizens and perceptions of responsiveness. The findings are theoretically important for reconciling the conflicting research on the effects of e-government and for understanding variations by level of government.

An exploratory survey analysis finds that the four citizenship perspectives are significantly related to political behavior, even when socioeconomic status and attitudinal variables related to participation are controlled.

The objective of this study is to explore how the dimension of Portuguese municipalities can explain the implementation of participatory processes and channels through e-government initiatives to improve participation and interaction with society. Based on the analysis of the municipal information and interaction indexes, our results show that municipalities are increasingly committed to developing online initiatives for citizen participation in a significant way over the years, with the largest municipalities being the ones that implement the most mechanisms. The influence of population size occurs both for information dissemination and for the implementation of citizen participation mechanisms. This result is consistent with stakeholder theory and political cost theory. This paper contributes to the literature by offering a characterization of the municipalities and the mechanisms carried out to implement citizen participation and interaction initiatives according to the size of the municipality. It claims that policy makers need to pay attention to the capabilities of e-governments tools to better facilitate the e-participation process and provide the necessary channels to get citizens' feedback.},

Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the field researchers find it difficult to consolidate their theoretical groundwork and further theory building in the eParticipation domain. This paper reports a literature study of conceptual publications on the subject of eParticipation/eDemocracy in the time frame of 2007-2009. Its objectives are to track recent theoretical development in the field, to reveal constraints and limitations to researching the area, and to offer some suggestions for further inquiry. The results show that most theories currently used in conceptual eParticipation research originate from the fields of Political Science and Media and Communication Studies. But together with this, contemporary eParticipation authors contribute to strengthening the field with some "in-house" models and frameworks as well. Central problems with eParticipation research concern immaturity of the field, topical gaps, and biased assumptions. The review shows that the themes of recent publications can be grouped into three major categories: stakeholders, environment, and applications and tools. It also finds some interconnections between these categories; however, in general the coupling technology-stakeholders-(participatory) environments is weak. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Swapan2016,
abstract = {In developing countries, the idea of community participation has been advocated largely by development scholars and practitioners inspired by western-based models. Such prescriptions for community participation focus largely on institutional reforms while ignoring social, political and psychological factors that also affect individuals' propensity to participate in the planning processes. Theoretical models that explain citizens' participation in the planning processes found in the extant literature do not adequately reflect the widespread realities of developing countries. Moreover, prior studies suggest that only few citizens, irrespective of diverse socio-economic background, have interest in participating in the planning process. Traditional participation spectrum views participation from a citizen activist's perspective and is, perhaps, sceptical of participation choices generated within current political context. In this article, it is contended that the rational decision-making employed by citizens in determining whether or not to be involved in the planning process defines the spectrum of participation. Reporting on a case study of the megacity - Dhaka - this article seeks to develop a community participation model that represents participants' realities as well as their aspiration to engage in decision-making and reflects the reasons for public apathy on participation. The empirical study identifies a range of social, political and psychological factors affecting an individual's attitude towards participation. These include an individual's lack of awareness, involvement in informal networks, discouraging perceptions about participation outcomes and most notably, lack of trust in the planning system. Citizens tend to avoid engaging in formal participation processes as the prevalent parallel system based on informal transactions with political leaders is perceived to be more effective than the formal planning system.},

However, research indicates that public administrations often struggle with technological and organizational changes, which suggests that e-participation initiatives may fail due to barriers within public administrations. Although researchers have paid considerable attention to the diffusion of e-participation in public administrations, research so far is multi-disciplinary and fragmented. The aim of this literature review is to structure and systematize the literature regarding phases of e-participation diffusion (adoption, implementation and institutionalization) and levels of analysis (micro, meso, and macro) to map the extant field of e-participation diffusion research and to provide a starting point for future research. The analysis shows that research has concentrated on the phases of adoption and implementation, and on the external context of public administrations (macro) and the organizational (meso) level.

abstract = {In recent years, information and communication technologies (ICT) have allowed governments to improve their internal functioning and to improve the delivery of information and services to their users. This application of ICT in governments has been conceptualized as “e-government”. However, more recently, smart cities emerged as a locally-embedded paradigm that proposes the design of innovative solutions across all domains of our everyday life (mobility, environment, economy, education, quality of life, and governance) with ICT as an enabler. In their recent evolutions, these two concepts have advocated for increased involvement of their stakeholders (citizens, businesses, public servants, etc.) through user-participation methods to support the design of their projects. This article intends to examine how these methods impact an e-government project and, more particularly, to find out which challenges and benefits practitioners experience. In order to reach that goal, we studied the case of the city of La Louvi{\`{e}}re (Belgium) through a one year plus study following action research's best practices. This article contributes at several levels. First, it describes the challenges and benefits experienced with participation methods in a concrete project. Second, it proposes an e-government implementation process enhanced with these methods. Third, this article discusses the similarities and differences between e-government and smart cities through the lens of participation methods.},

Ethical contradictions: maximizing transparency with high manipulability; independence of decisions with controversial anonymity; reducing bureaucratic procedures as fraud acts increase; reduced number of absentists with persisting distrust of the system. Also, the methods of e-democracy within one society can create premises for both digital authoritarization and the strengthening of the role of civil society.},

abstract = {This research aims to build an e-participation system for the citizens in the public policy process using blockchain technology. E-participation makes it easier for citizens to have a say in important policy decisions and helps the government be more open, inclusive, collaborative, and thoughtful. It improves government transparency, citizen involvement, and marginalized group inclusion. Yet, the limited scope of existing e-participation approaches and implementation processes makes using e-participation ineffective. E-participation platforms for citizen-government engagement often fail to meet targets and uptake expectations. In addition, the challenges involve overcoming the constraints associated with current methods, guaranteeing transparency, security, and privacy when engaging citizens, and effectively managing the intricate process of integrating various components and handling confidential information. However, blockchain applications are gaining popularity because blockchain technology can change the way how businesses operate. This study offers a blockchain-based innovative e-participation system to increase democratic engagement in a secure and decentralized environment as centralized servers struggle with transparency, security, and privacy concerns. Decentralized, immutable, and incorruptible blockchain technology solves these challenges. The proposed e-participation system can encourage public participation in governance and promote democracy. The proposed E-participation is based on a model that includes government agencies, the public/citizens, digital platforms, decision-making, communication/feedback, and decision-making. This research uses national population data and election codes and regulations to run experiments and simulation models. Process simulation will develop and build the e-participation system's software, hardware, and storage devices. The proposed four layers of blockchain-based e-participation are integrated. They have their purposes, which include government agencies, registration and verification, a blockchain-based e-participation network, and data storage.},

Today, many government administrations have set up public participation processes as one more of the inputs required to make a decision on several aspects of governance. e-Participation initiatives make it easier for citizens to access such processes. At the present time, there is no clear and accepted field definition due to the wide diversity of theoretical proposals and the interdisciplinary nature of the initiatives, many of which have been developed ad-hoc. This paper reviews the present literature in the field of e-Participation by means of a systematic mapping of the research work carried out in the timeframe 2000-2019, together with some earlier relevant proposals in the area, with the aim of obtaining a conceptual guide to e-Participation components. This review analyses the findings and clusters the results into a conceptual e-Participation framework, which we call ePfw. The results show the diversity of the conceptualizations of many authors (25% on average) in the identification of tools, areas and levels in the field of e-participation and the almost null incorporation of fundamental aspects like trust, security, or transparency.

Previous studies on e-participation have shown that this form of participation can increase the level of flexibility and inclusiveness of public engagements, make government interventions more responsive to citizens' needs, and increase government accountability. While there is a growing use of e-participation in the planning systems of developed countries, its application in developing countries has remained very limited. This paper explores the barriers to employing e-participation in the context of a developing country's planning system, using Iran as a case study. We have conducted interviews with different planning actors, including both public- and private-sector planners, to investigate what they perceive as such barriers. The results of this study show that the primary barriers to e-participation in Iran are attitudes towards participation, the structure and culture of the planning system, and staff capacity to engage the public through e-participation. The paper concludes with a series of recommendations regarding how these barriers can be overcome.},

It also stimulated scholarly debate on how to conceptualize political participation in a digital age. Scholars differ on whether to consider passive and expressive online behaviors part of or a mere precursor to political participation. This study argues that due to its rapid evolution as well as its dependence on platform affordances, quantitative empirical studies on OPP may be prone to deviations between established, much-cited definitions and measurements applied in the field. Based on a systematic literature review of 289 international peer-reviewed survey-based and experimental studies, we analyze both definitions and measurements of OPP. We find a series of disconnections: Measures preponderantly address online activities, yet merely a small share of definitions focuses on the online sphere. While only few definitions account for passive activities (e.g., reading news about politics), many operationalizations include measures capturing such passive behaviors. Expressive activities are most popular in measures of OPP, but definitions rarely reflect this focus. Finally, while measures of OPP are prone to be platform-specific, definitions tend to neglect this characteristic. We conclude by reflecting the conceptual implications of common measurement practices for the study of OPP.},

Thus, this study attempts to extend surrogates to such gaps by integrating PR and user trust (UT) in IR e-government using mixed-methods. It involved both a qualitative study (n = 81) to identify perceive risk antecedents and quantitative study (369 users) to build and test the proposed model. Results show that of eight PR factors, only privacy, time, psychological, and overall emerged as negative influencers and as such indirectly affect the IR government, through the mediating role of perceived value and user's trust.

The approach showed that both the majority of workers in the city hall and most of the locals in the commune, who provided us with answers in the survey, appreciate that the involvement of citizens in the public decision-making process is key to democracy. Most of both respondents categories states that the main arguments for consulting the public in the process of making a public decision are: the right of citizens, ensuring the effective adoption and implementation of decisions, the decisions taken are accepted/supported by society, promoting the transparency of the decision-making process. Expressing own choice, submitting requests to the local public administration, submitting written suggestions, informal discussions tend to be considered by both the surveyed staff and the responding residents as effectve and very effective ways. On the other hand, we have found that opinion polls are one of the least effective ways for citizens to participate, with most opinions, in the case of both categories of respondents, being recorded for the small and very small response varieties.},

abstract = {The phenomenon of eParticipation is receiving increasing attention, demonstrated by recent technology implementations, experiments, government reports, and research programs. Understanding such an emerging field is a complex endeavor because there is no generally agreed upon definition of the field, no clear overview of the research disciplines or methods it draws upon, and because the boundaries of the field are undecided. Using conventional literature review techniques, we identify 131 scientific articles considered important for the field's theoretical development. This sample provides the starting point for a grounded analysis leading to the development of an overview model: the field of eParticipation seen from a researcher's perspective. The model provides structure for understanding the emerging shape of the field as well as an initial indication of its content. It also provides the basis for developing research agendas for the future. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This article seeks to highlight the prevalent role of electronic participation (e-participation) in the implementation of e-government (EG) and possible approaches in enhancing the application of e-government through the insertion of e-participation module. Previous case studies on e-participation cover definitions and technique of e-participation, applicable strategies to implement e-participation, and the quality of e-participation for top management decision making. Several literature in EG supports the statement that e-participation could improve the quality of public sector governance process. As a result, most developed countries implemented EG projects to enable involvement of citizens in the political decision making process through e-participation. However, this is not the case in most of the developing countries which focus more on improving public sector services rather than e-participation. Among others, there are arguments which focus on the issue of lack of citizen participation in the political process through the Internet. This is particularly true in the context of EG implementation in developing countries whereby the focus is more on e-services rather than e- participation. Malaysian government has implemented EG, since 1997 under one of the MSC flagships, to deliver information and services in an integrated manner. Malaysian Government Portal or myGovernment performs as a single platform providing information and services related to government agencies. Despite this effort, myGovernment, as evident in other developing nations, also does not place emphasis on e-participation. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {The DeLone and McLean (DM) information systems (IS) success model seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of IS success by identifying and explaining the relationships among their most critical dimensions of success. Many studies have offered important insights into this model. Nevertheless, regarding the e-learning body of knowledge, DM research remains to be systematically reviewed comprehensively. E-learning refers to the use of information technology to disseminate knowledge for education and training. With today's e-learning boom necessitated for the most part by COVID-19, its adoption has become increasingly mandatory. Thus, a systematic review should help focus and accelerate future research. This study systematically reviews, compiles, analyzes, and synthesizes the DM model studies in the e-learning context. This review adopts automatic and manual search methods to collect related studies from 2010 to 2020. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 92 primary studies are identified. The findings show that most of reviewed studies were conducted in the education field. The success category was the most highly investigated area from among the selected studies. Most studies developed a hybrid/extended model. Additionally, this study also identified gaps in the literature and recommends seven potential future areas requiring further investigation, such as conducting studies to examine the net benefits at the organizational level of analysis. To that end, the findings of this systematic review study provide an impactful contribution through offering a holistic review of the current state of DM model studies in an e-learning context, providing an essential reference for scholars in this field.},

During the last few years, eParticipation researchers have focused on analysing the field, investigating the main challenges, studying different initiatives, and proposing relevant evaluation criteria. However, current literature lacks comprehensive studies for understanding the factors influencing success when designing eParticipation initiatives. The main aim of this paper is to determine a concrete set of success factors to be considered when designing an eParticipation initiative. For this purpose, we review the literature on eGovernment success and on eParticipation success and evaluation, and we conduct a European-wide survey and desktop research amongst eParticipation practitioners. By comparing findings from the literature and the practitioners' research, we thereafter construct a proposed model of eParticipation success factors. The model includes 23 success factors and specific activities associated with each factor. We anticipate that our model will be useful to both eParticipation researchers and practitioners interested in the design of eParticipation initiatives.},

This study addresses the following research questions: How are different organizations and their units involved in the supply of e-participation initiatives? How does the multiplicity of actors affect cross-boundary collaboration, ownership, and accountability relations in the implementation of e-participation initiatives? The empirical analysis is based on comparative case studies on e-participation platforms in seven European countries. The case studies indicate that cross-organizational issues—ownership and accountability, in particular—have often been insufficiently addressed during the development of e-participation initiatives. Ambiguous ownership and diffused accountability are particularly challenging in the cases of multilevel governance and in “bottom-up” e-participation initiatives. The “distance” between the unit responsible for the administration of an e-participation initiative and the decision-makers appears to be a critical factor for the functioning of the platforms.},

abstract = {Local governments around the world are increasingly implementing e-participation platforms to involve citizens in consultation and decision-making processes. E-participation platforms usually succeed and produce positive effects in the community when adopted in the long-term scenario. The adoption of those platforms is still a challenge for local governments. The understanding of the factors that influence the continuous intention to use e-participation over time is critical for the design of diffusion and promotion strategies that motivate the citizens to keep using e-participation. This article explores the drivers that predict the post-adoption of e-participation platforms from the perspective of the sense of virtual community theory, that is the degree of affective attachment to a given community mediated by information technology. Specifically, our research model evaluates the association between the sense of virtual community with use behaviour and the continuous intention to use e-participation. Structural equation modelling was used to evaluate the data collected from 370 citizens who experienced an e-participation platform hosted by a European capital city. We found out that the direct association between the sense of virtual community and use was significant. Even though the direct association between the sense of virtual community and the continuous intention was non-significant, the indirect association sense of virtual community to use to continuous intention was statistically significant. This finding may indicate that the use behaviour is triggered by the influence of other members of the community for a short period of time, but it does not persist to influence the continuous intention over time.},

A sustainable development strategy can serve as a political control instrument and management tool. For the development and implementation of such a strategy at the local level, municipalities might use citizen participation approaches. There exist manifold ways of consulting civil society, representing different levels of decision-making power. The analysis of this article is divided into two parts. First, we report on a case study of the pilot project “Global Sustainable Municipalities” located in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany and assess the current status of the use of citizen participation formats for adopting a local sustainable development strategy. Second, we developed a model of citizen participation approaches during different phases of adopting a sustainable development strategy. The purpose of this model is to assess the potential decision-making power of citizens during the phases and to help municipalities to get an orientation on participation possibilities. The results show that most municipalities count on participation mainly in the implementation phase of the strategy, less during developing it. Our model, however, demonstrates participation possibilities for each of the phases.},

With the emergence of ICTs, citizens' participation processes took new forms such as social media, blogs and participative platforms. Nevertheless, although citizens' participation outstands a great value for governments, its implementation raises several issues. Based on a review of the literature, this paper identifies a typology of issues regarding the implementation of CP processes. This paper is an attempt to open new research avenues on citizens' participation through the multidisciplinary typology of issues it proposes. As well, drawing on two categories of issues (citizens' and technology issues), a context-based citizen participation approach is proposed that is based on three main concepts: context-based reasoning, spatio-temporal representation, and visual analytics. Further empirical studies need to be established to assert the relevance of the proposed approach.},

In response to the Open Government Directive, U.S. federal agencies developed their open government plan and launched numerous social media-based public engagement initiatives. However, we find that many of these initiatives do not deliver the intended outcomes due to various organizational, technological, and financial challenges. We propose an Open Government Maturity Model based on our field studies with U.S. federal healthcare administration agencies. This model is specifically developed to assess and guide open government initiatives which focus on transparent, interactive, participatory, collaborative public engagement that are largely enabled by emerging technologies such as social media. The model consists of five maturity levels: initial conditions (Level 1), data transparency (Level 2), open participation (Level 3), open collaboration (Level 4), and ubiquitous engagement (Level 5). We argue that there is a logical sequence for increasing social media-based public engagement and agencies should focus on achieving one maturity level at a time. The Open Government Maturity Model helps government agencies implement their open government initiatives effectively by building organizational and technological capabilities in an orderly manner. We discuss challenges and best practices for each maturity level and conclude by presenting recommendations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Finding a plethora of competing labels, models, and concepts for Internet-facilitated coproduction, the paper proposes a formal taxonomy to provide a more robust framework for systematic analysis. The paper then applies this framework to evaluate the impact of the tools of the Information Age on citizen coproduction. Its findings cautiously support the claim that the Information Age enables and advances new forms of citizen coproduction, namely large-scale "Do-It-Yourself Government" and "Government as a Platform."

abstract = {The rapid growth of e-Commerce amongst private sectors and Internet usage amongst citizens has vastly stimulated e-Government initiatives from many countries. The Thailand e-Government initiative is based on the government's long-term strategic policy that aims to reform and overhaul the Thai bureaucracy. This study attempted to identify the e-Excise success factors by employing the IS success model. The study focused on finding the factors that may contribute to the success of the e-Excise initiative. The Delphi Technique was used to investigate the determinant factors for the success of the e-Excise initiative. Three-rounds of data collection were conducted with 77 active users from various industries. The results suggest that by increasing Trust in the e-Government website, Perceptions of Information Quality, Perceptions of System Quality, and Perceptions of Service Quality will influence System Usage and User Satisfaction, and will ultimately have consequences for the Perceived Net Benefits. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

To assess this endeavor's progress, existing e-Government maturity models were evaluated. The majority of models mainly focus on technical characteristics of an administrative act, while disregarding the importance of (1) public servants, (2) their work situation and (3) organizational processes. It is the latter three determining successful digitalization. Consequently, we fuse previous e-Government maturity models with the individual perspective of public servants including internet-based work, virtualization of teams and societal participation.

abstract = {The main objective of this research is to examine the use of Information & Communication Technologies (ICT) and derive the success factors of eParticipation initiatives according to the electronic government (eGovernment) content evaluation. For this purpose, an African study took place using a two-step methodological technique: ‘review of the United Nations' eGovernment survey report; and a wide review from the existing literature. The results suggest that the tools and technologies presently applied are mainly general purpose and not exactly designed for eParticipation. In addition, the results indicated that success factors can be categorized into seven groups of factors: government commitment; usability; combination of both online and offline networks; comprehensive communication and encouraging plan; security and privacy, organizational issues; and topics complexity. A comparison with reviewed factors of eParticipation initiatives success suggests there are similarities and significant differences on ICT usage among countries. This study anticipates that its results could be of interest to practitioners as it highlights some knowledge in a practical way. Furthermore, this research could be of interest to researchers as it contributes in validating eParticipation evaluation models.  },

abstract = {For decades, user participation has brought value to various systems development projects. Today, there are expectations that public e-service development will experience the same benefits. However, existing research has shown that introducing user participation into public e-service development can be challenging. In this study, we interviewed citizens in order to explore their willingness and ability to participate in public e-service development according to three user participation schools: User-Centred Design, Participatory Design and User Innovation. Our findings show that citizens in general are willing to participate, but their ability to do so is limited. Based on our findings, we developed nine propositions to explain citizens' willingness and ability to participate in public e-service development. The propositions contribute to practice by acting as a tentative guide for systems developers when they use user participation schools as inspiration in public e-service projects. They also act as a starting point for future research into conditions for user participation in public e-service development. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {We investigated what people consider the optimal level of citizen involvement in local policy decision-making. This is an important question to answer, given that civil servants and politicians are increasingly confronted with the pressure to add a participatory layer to representative democratic policy-making. Across five empirical studies (total N = 1470), we consistently found that, overall, the most preferred decision-making model is a balanced model in which citizens and the government are equally involved. Despite this preferred ‘overall' pattern of equal involvement, we identified three subgroups within the citizenry with different preference curves: Some citizens prefer a model in which citizens and the government are truly equal partners, whereas others prefer a model in which either the government or citizens are relatively more involved in the policy decision-making process. The main contribution of our work is thus that we identified a perceived ‘overall' optimal level of citizen engagement, and variations to that optimum depending on citizens' individual traits. This information might be helpful to policy-makers in developing effective citizen participation processes.},

abstract = {In its simplest form, smart government can be understood as the combination of new technologies and organizational innovation strategies to further modernize the public sector. Within this development, the Internet of Things (IoT) often forms a key technological foundation, offering government authorities new possibilities for interaction with citizens and local communities. On the one hand, citizens can indirectly participate in governmental services' value creation by using public infrastructure or (un)knowingly sharing their data with the community. On the other hand, smart government initiatives may rely more intensively on citizens' active participation to improve public service delivery, increase trust in government actions, and strengthen community sentiment. In this chapter, we discuss active and passive participation scenarios of smart government initiatives and explain how sensor-based systems may enhance citizens' opportunities to participate in local governance. We present two practical cases from Switzerland demonstrating these two citizen involvement modes. We argue that active and passive participation of citizens and other stakeholders play a key role in generating necessary data for algorithmic decision-making to enable personalized interaction and real-time control of infrastructure in the future. We close with a discussion of the possibilities and boundaries of the IoT in the public sector and their possible influences on citizens' privacy and policy-making.},

abstract = {Nowadays, most world countries, including BRICS countries, have been actively promoting open government initiatives based on public participation in the development of social and economic priorities of a state. However, despite the fact that public participation has been declared to take place quite often, there are very few occasions when such projects' effectiveness is evaluated. Modern literature offers a range of recommendations related to selection of criteria and evaluation methods for public participation projects. However, on the one hand, most recommendations involve additional interaction with project participants in order to make an assessment and virtually no “contactless” evaluation methods have been proposed (methods based on the published project reports). On the other hand, among the considered criteria we have not found a very important group of criteria – criteria for evaluating the significance of questions submitted for discussion for people's well-being. Therefore, this article aims to develop a methodology for evaluating e-participation projects based on the published project reports. The proposed evaluation methodology has been used to assess a project titled “Active citizen”. It was concluded that the subject matter of questions discussed on “Active citizen” platform largely reflect the subject matter of problems facing the Muscovites. The article proposes further steps to improve the methodology for evaluating the effectiveness of e-participation projects based on published reports.},

abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to summarize and classify extant research and to better understand the past, present, and future state of the theory of value co-creation. Its main objectives are: to identify the different theoretical perspectives and research streams that characterize and define the co-creation literature, and to highlight the connections between them; to look for emerging trends and gaps in the literature by comparing the most recent papers with those representing the field's core.
Design/methodology/approach – The paper relies on bibliometric data: co-citation techniques were employed to select, analyze, and interpret citation patterns within the co-creation literature.
Findings – The paper identified two main clusters, as well as specific research streams and common themes, representing scholarly journals' publications on co-creation over the past years. These research streams and themes apply three different theoretical perspectives: service science, innovation and technology management, and marketing and consumer research. Data from the most recent publications has been used to verify if and how the original streams and themes are reflected in the contemporary debate.
Research limitations/implications – Inevitably, the findings of the analysis have limitations related to the research design, the databases, and the applied bibliometric methods.
Practical implications – From a practical perspective, the research impacts on theory building, management decision making, and teaching.
Originality/value – This study depicts the remarkable development of the literature on co-creation and shows the latent structure underlying its different research streams. To the best knowledge, this study is the first to determine co-citation frequencies from both the SSCI and Scopus databases.},

To analyze and understand the consequences of this transition, we employ a case study with inspiration ethnographic in the Porto Alegre Municipal Council for Urban and Environmental Development in Porto Alegre, Brazil. While e-participation has the potential to include individuals who were previously unable to participate in face-to-face meetings, it also presents limitations. A significant portion of the population lacks the digital literacy or appropriate devices necessary to engage effectively in online sessions. Moreover, when e-participation was first implemented, plenary sessions were broadcasted without giving viewers the right to express their opinions on the topics discussed. This situation highlights the need for a new framework that considers the process of transitioning from in-person participation to e-participation due to the constraints imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our research intends to contribute to the theoretical literature by exploring the possibilities of transforming participation into e-participation in countries of the global south.},

Recent in situ and laboratory observations indicate that cidaroid sea urchins feed on live stalked crinoids, leaving distinct bite marks on their skeletal elements. Similar bite marks on fossil crinoids from Poland strongly suggest that these animals have been subject to echinoid predation since the Triassic. Following their near-demise during the end-Permian extinction, crinoids underwent a major evolutionary radiation during the Middle-Late Triassic that produced distinct morphological and behavioral novelties, particularly motile taxa that contrasted strongly with the predominantly sessile Paleozoic crinoid faunas. We suggest that the appearance and subsequent evolutionary success of motile crinoids were related to benthic predation by post-Paleozoic echinoids with their stronger and more active feeding apparatus and that, in the case of crinoids, the predation-driven Mesozoic marine revolution started earlier than in other groups, perhaps soon after the end-Permian extinction.},

Different researchers have addressed different aspects of success, making comparisons difficult and the prospect of building a cumulative tradition for I/S research similarly elusive. To organize this diverse research, as well as to present a more integrated view of the concept of I/S success, a comprehensive taxonomy is introduced. This taxonomy posits six major dimensions or categories of I/S success-SYSTEM QUALITY, INFORMATION QUALITY, USE, USER SATISFACTION, INDIVIDUAL IMPACT, and ORGANIZATIONAL IMPACT. Using these dimensions, both conceptual and empirical studies are then reviewed (a total of 180 articles are cited) and organized according to the dimensions of the taxonomy. Finally, the many aspects of I/S success are drawn together into a descriptive model and its implications for future I/S research are discussed. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1992.

Based on the success model of the information system (IS access model), we set independent variables which were divided into quality factors (service quality, system quality, information quality) and risk factors (personal information and security), and perceived ease of use and reliability, which are the main variables based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) that best describes the parameter group, were established as useful parameters. In addition, we design the research model by setting user satisfaction and the continuous use intention as dependent variables, conducted the study about how affecting factors influence to the acceptance factors through 14 hypotheses.The study found that 12 from 14 hypotheses were adopted and 2 were rejected. Looking at the results derived, it was analyzed that, firstly, 3 quality factors all affect perceived ease of use in relation to the quality of service, system quality, information quality which are perceived ease of use of E-Government Services. Second, in relation to the quality of service quality, system quality, information quality and perceived usefulness which are the quality factors of E-Government Services, the quality of service and information quality affect perceived usefulness, but system quality does not affect perceived usefulness. Third, it was analyzed that both factors influence reliability in the relationship between Privacy and security and trust which are risk factors. Fourth, the relationship between perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness has shown that perceived ease of use does not affect perceived usefulness. Finally, the relationship between user value factors (perceptual usability, perceived usefulness and trust) and user satisfaction and the continuous use intention was analyzed that user value factors affect user satisfaction while user satisfaction affects the continuous use intention. This study can be meaningful in that it theoretically presented the factors influencing the continued acceptance of e-government services through precedent research, presented the variables and measurement items verified through the empirical analysis process, and verified the causal relationship between the variables. The e-government service can contribute to the implementation of e-government in line with the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution by using it as a reference to the establishment of policies to improve the quality of people's lives and provide convenient services to the people.},

abstract = {During the last decade, various types of eGovernment evaluations have been proposed. These evaluations have primarily focused on international benchmarking using supply side metrics. Demand for eGovernment has been largely ignored. Recently, this oversight has been recognised, but research in this area is still in its infancy. This paper proposes the use of an already established usability literature from computer science. Advantages of applying usability methods to eGovernment include recognising barriers to use, identifying future development priorities and using already existing methods to assess and compare online offerings. Importantly, the inclusion of and focus on real users also fits with the wider government ideals of greater public participation and strengthening democracy.To highlight the potential of such an approach, we present a case study. Usability methods, such as presented here in a user survey, can develop new insights by expressly targeting different user groups and through open-ended questions. The outcomes of this method are immediately useful for prioritising and undertaking future online development as well as comparing eGovernment provision. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {This paper seeks to achieve a better understanding of how and under what conditions current digital communication technologies can become an asset to the design of effective policies. In order to do so, we bridge two strands of reflection that have hitherto developed quite independently–i.e. policy design studies and researches on the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) to reform the public sector. We start from the assumption that different governmental political and technical capacities shape different spaces for action and thus different types of policy design in which policy-makers can involve citizens via ICTs in three modes: co-design; design fine-tuning; crowdsourced policy design. According to this framework, we analyse three different ‘revelatory case studies' in which ICTs have been employed by governments while designing policies: Iceland's recent experiment to redraft collectively its constitution; La Buona Scuola, the latest Italian public education law; and the Finnish Avoin Misteri{\"{o}}, a platform for crowdsourced legislation. By exploring the different modes in which ICTs have been integrated in the formulation of these three policies, we show that it is possible to disentangle different and more or less effective ways of exploiting ICTs' networking and communicative potential for designing successful public policies.},

The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the extent to which an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) facilitates t-knowledge in e-government services offered by City Halls. We also investigate whether t-knowledge has an effect on citizen engagement in government initiatives. In this research, an extended TAM is developed to test t-knowledge in online e-government services employing a sample of 307 citizens who used the benefits advisor tool provided by a Spanish City Hall. The results suggest that the core constructs of TAM (perceived usefulness, ease of use and attitude) significantly affect t-knowledge.

While recent research has given greater attention to growing discussions of participatory approaches of Chinese urban regeneration projects, a majority of existing literature has only examined the nature or limitations of public participation, there has been far less consideration of the government's motivation in delivering these inclusive policies. This paper interprets Nanjing's inclusive urban policies through the conceptual lens of governmentality by analyzing the revanchist residual of Chinese urban regeneration. This research combines narratives from in-depth interviews (with a particular focus on key policymakers) and supplementary data from policies and archival records. It demonstrates that the implementation of inclusive urban policies in Nanjing is a remedy to the past “revanchist” urban regeneration policies. Indeed, public participation is a method refers to the restoration of residents' rights, seeking to direct them to behave towards what the government wants them to be. To that end, I conclude that if the spirit of revanchism still exists, it is through the inclusive urban policies to conduct local residents' conducts.},

These small-scale gardening and greening initiatives can be seen as a way to re-mobilize inhabitants and even involve them in urban planning. But is this the case? How do citizens frame their role and relationship with the public space, and in terms of the local administration? Also, NGOs and other groups acting as ‘mediators' in the process facilitate civic action, but how do citizens feel about the actions of these facilitators? Based on an action-research project carried out in Quebec City (Quebec, Canada), we address what it means to take part in greening projects at a micro-scale. Using participant observations, 20 interviews, and field notes, we look at how such projects operate and evolve. The greening projects that were studied benefited from the support of the NGO, which acted as a facilitator throughout the process.

However, little is known about the prospects of using Information and Communication Technology to foster public participation in urban planning in conservative Arab societies. This study investigates public willingness to participate in the urban planning process through the Internet and smartphones in Saudi Arabia. Data was collected through a questionnaire survey of residents of Dammam city and analyzed using descriptive (frequency distribution) and inferential statistics (z-tests and Chi-square). The study finds that most participants across all social and demographic groups are aware of e-participation in urban planning and have a significantly positive attitude towards it. Furthermore, they indicate more willingness to e-participate in planning at the local level or on issues that directly affect them. Also, in all stages of preparing urban plans, most participants preferred e-participation over the traditional mode through public hearings and seminars. The paper sheds light on the diffusion of ICT and its potential to facilitate public participation in urban planning in conservative and patriarchal developing countries. Integrating e-participation in urban planning can facilitate public engagement and collaboration with planning authorities to better serve the competing public interests and ensure inclusive urban development.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this research is to investigate if, and in that case, how and what the e-government field can learn from user participation concepts and theories in general information systems (IS) research. It aims to contribute with further understanding of the importance of citizen participation and involvement within the e-government research body of knowledge and when developing public e-services in practice. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis in the paper is made from a comparative, qualitative case study of two e-government projects. Three analysis themes are induced from the literature review; practice of participation, incentives for participation, and organization of participation. These themes are guiding the comparative analysis of our data with a concurrent openness to interpretations from the field. Findings: The main results in this paper are that the e-government field can get inspiration and learn from methods and approaches in traditional IS projects concerning user participation, but in e-government, methods are also needed to handle the challenges that arise when designing public e-services for large, heterogeneous user groups. Citizen engagement cannot be seen as a separate challenge in e-government, but rather as an integrated part of the process of organizing, managing, and performing e-government projects. Analysis themes of participation generated from literature; practice, incentives and organization can be used in order to highlight, analyze, and discuss main issues regarding the challenges of citizen participation within e-government. This is an important implication based on this paper that contributes both to theory on and practice of e-government. Practical implications: Lessons to learn from this paper concern that many e-government projects have a public e-service as one outcome and an internal e-administration system as another outcome. A dominating internal, agency perspective in such projects might imply that citizens as the user group of the e-service are only seen as passive receivers of the outcome - not as active participants in the development. By applying the analysis themes, proposed in this paper, citizens as active participants can be thoroughly discussed when initiating (or evaluating) an e-government project. Originality/value: The paper addresses challenges regarding citizen participation in e-government development projects. User participation is well researched within the IS discipline, but the e-government setting implies new challenges that are not explored enough. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

Although the European Commission and national governments have made multiple efforts to mitigate this problem, young people are increasingly detached from traditional forms of politics, such as political party and trade union membership, and voting. However, this does not mean that young people are indifferent to what policymakers do and decide. The recent mobilizations for the future of the environment through the Fridays for Future and Extinction Rebellion movements and other forms of protest clearly show that young people want to play an active part of change in their communities. Our contribution focuses on the youth's attitudes toward democracy and the possibilities of e-democracy to strengthen democratic participation. Based on a review of successful e-participation platforms, we identify examples of best practices in this field. We also investigate supply and demand side factors regarding youth e-democracy initiatives by conducting interviews with local policymakers and a survey among young people in three European cities, i.e., Krakow (Poland), Leiden (Netherlands), and Trieste (Italy). Our results demonstrate that young people are eager to get involved politically when provided with tools targeted to them. E-democracy platforms thus hold considerable potential to promote democratic participation among young people.},

abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to predict the intention to participate (ITP) in public activities by utilizing five levels of e-participation reported in the literature. The study used the levels of e-informing, e-consulting, e-involving, e-collaborating and e-empowering as predictors of the intention to participate in e-government services. Design/methodology/approach: An empirical test was adopted using a survey to measure the five levels of e-participation and the dependent variable, ITP in e-government initiatives. The survey included items from previous studies translated to Arabic. Subjects responded to a five-point Likert scale to measure their perceptions regarding the sub-dimensions of each e-participation level. Statistical analyses of the collected data were conducted to test the assumed hypotheses. Multiple regression of the five predictor levels was conducted to predict the ITP in e-government services. Findings: All the estimated means of e-participation levels were moderately perceived. The regression results indicated a significant prediction of three levels: e-informing, e-consulting and e-empowering. The other two levels (e-involving and e-collaborating) failed to predict the ITP. The coefficient of determination R2 resulting from the regression test was significant at the 0.001 level, which explained 61.9 per cent of the variance in the dependent variable. Research limitations/implications: The instrument used is a newly developed one in Arabic language, which might have influenced the results. The distinction between e-involving and e-collaborating might not have been recognized by subjects, which might have increased the limitations of the study. The results of this study call for more research to validate the instrument and try to see if new statements of e-consulting and e-involving might be employed. The other side could be to reduce the levels to three levels only or merge the insignificant ones into one (four levels only). Practical implications: Governments need to assert the role of citizens in the decision-making process. Such assertion is done through the e-participation process. Social implications: Jordanians perceive the e-informing and e-consulting levels to be a foundation that can be easily attained, but jumping to the e-empowering level means that the society is keen on the partnership with the government. Originality/value: This study is the first to use the participation levels (five levels) as predictors of the ITP. Most studies have utilized theories such as technology acceptance model (TAM), theory of reseaoned action (TRA) and unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) and other technology adoption theories. Also, this research has established ground for an Arabic survey to measure such levels, regardless of their prediction or description purpose.},

Therefore, this study investigates the factors that are influencing citizens' intention to engage in government-led e-Participation initiatives through Facebook. To that end, the study proposes and validates a citizen-centric acceptance model. The proposed model extends the model primarily established on the theory of planned behavior, by incorporating additional factors that emerged from relevant literature. The research data were collected from a survey of 400 Facebook users in Jordan using a probability sample technique. The results revealed that the factors with the most significant influence on citizens' intention to engage in government-led e-participation initiatives through Facebook are: the citizens' attitude, participation efficacy, and perceived behavior control. Subjective norms and perceived value, however, have no direct effect on citizens' intention to engage in government-led e-participation initiatives through Facebook. Furthermore, the results showed that the citizens' attitude is primarily determined by participation efficacy, perceived usefulness and compatibility of Facebook, and perceived value. In contrast, the factors perceived ease of use of Facebook, citizens' trust in government, and citizens' trust in Facebook, have no significant impact on citizens' attitude. These factors have rarely been empirically tested in the context of e-participation. Consequently, this study paves the way towards a better understanding of the important factors that influence citizens' intention to participate, which, in turn, will inform the design and implementation of e-participation initiatives.},

Therefore, the current study develops a theoretical citizen-centric model that seeks to explain and predict the intention of citizens' behavior towards their involvement in government-led e-Participation initiatives through social media. The methodological approach is primarily based on utilizing and extending one of the well-known theories for describing a person acceptance behavior, namely the Theory of Planned Behavior.

abstract = {As a consequence of the interdisciplinary nature of Electronic Participation (e-Participation), current research on the field is fragmented and scattered. The exciting blurry boundaries and the immature identity of the field are making difficult the understanding of the main domain themes being investigated, in particular for “neophytes” researchers. In practice, several e-Participation initiatives often attract a wide audience but face serious limitations regarding involvement of those who attract. Recently, the potential of using social media to address citizens' involvement deficit has been subject of academic debate. By consulting 44 e-Participation papers, considered highly relevant to the aforementioned challenges, this paper produces a general overview of e-Participation research, particularly through social media. The findings show that the e-Participation field still faces the challenge of identity and strive for gaining wider recognition as an independent research area. Concerning e-Participation through social media which seems to be partly overlooked in the field research, the politicians-citizen's interaction has dominated scholars' attention and the adoption of such initiatives sponsored and driven by governments are rarely examine. Based on the findings, several research suggestions, which could play a significant contribution to advance future e-Participation research, are proposed.},

The essence of such relations between public agencies and citizens is a collaboration in policy-making and the implementing of policy decisions on shared goals. Prominent collaborative (e-)participation models are participatory budgeting, citizen assemblies, citizen panels, community councils, round tables, and similar procedures, especially in domains such as urban and regional planning and local governance. Electronic communication and an expanding repertoire of Internet-based applications play an essential role in facilitating collaborative participation. Possible impacts can be increased influence of citizens on public decision-making and positive effects on the implementation of policies, on transparency, political culture, and the competences of participants.},

abstract = {Weight loss interventions are delivered through various mediums including, increasingly, mobile phones. This systematic review and meta-analysis assesses whether interventions delivered via mobile phones reduce body weight and which intervention characteristics are associated with efficacy. The study included randomised controlled trials assessing the efficacy of weight loss interventions delivered via mobile phones. A meta-analysis to test intervention efficacy was performed, and subgroup analyses were conducted to determine whether interventions' delivery mode(s), inclusion of personal contact, duration and interaction frequency improve efficacy. Pooled body weight reduction (d = −0.23; 95% confidence interval = −0.38, −0.08) was significant. Interventions delivered via other modes in addition to the mobile phone were associated with weight reduction. Personal contact and more frequent interactions in interventions were also associated with greater weight reduction. In conclusion, the current body of evidence shows that interventions delivered via mobile phones produce a modest reduction in body weight when combined with other delivery modes. Delivering interventions with frequent and personal interactions may in particular benefit weight loss results.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the factors that enable end-user adoption of e-government services in Pakistan, where these facilities are at a rudimentary stage. Design/methodology/approach: Following previous research on e-government services adoption, this study employs the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model to examine the influential factors of the adoption and use of e-government services in Pakistan from a citizen perspective. An online survey was conducted and a statistical descriptive analysis was performed on the responses received from 115 Pakistani citizens. Findings: In line with previous research, the findings show that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions and social influence are the factors that affect the user's adoption of e-government services in Pakistan. Furthermore, the results show that lack of awareness, user data privacy, lack of appropriate support and assistance hamper the process. Practical implications: The findings are useful for policy-makers and decision-makers to develop a better understanding of citizens' needs. The adopted model can be used as a guideline for the implementation of e-government services in Pakistan. This study suggests that government should run extensive advertising campaigns to ensure that people are aware of the services and use them. This implies that government should place emphasis on increasing awareness of the services, show the benefits of citizens, and encouraging confidence in the system. Originality/value: This study is one of the few to examine what influences citizens adoption of e-government services in South Asia. This paper is the first step exploring end-user adoption of the e-government services of Pakistan using UTAUT model. Corresponding to previous research, this study enforces the significance of particular factors that need to be considered when the goal is to increase e-government services adoption in developing countries, particularly South Asian. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

@article{Adnan2022,
abstract = {Context: The e-government concept has gained significant interest from academics and practitioners. E-government projects have altered how government institutions communicate, share content, collaborate, and interact with citizens. Nowadays, e-government systems are crucial resources for facilitating government work and interaction with other people and organizations to co-operation with each other. Despite the availability of authentic research studies on the trend of e-government, there is still a need to conduct a comprehensive review and combine findings from earlier studies, as well as to define the current issues surrounding e-participation in the context of e-government initiatives. Objective: The main aim of this study is to review the previous literature to explore and understand the issues surrounding e-participation within the context of e-government initiatives, and to what extent these issues impact the success of these initiatives. Method: In this study, a systematic review method has been used to gather, analyze, and synthesize data regarding the accuracy and value of previous articles. This method followed a predefined review protocol and used both automated and manual research methods to find all the relevant research papers that were published in digital databases between 2010 and 2020. Results: According to the review study, we extracted 211 articles that addressed the key issues that negatively affected the level of e-participation, which were analyzed by following a systematic mapping method that collected significant information to fulfill the research aim. We classified and investigated the published papers that addressed a broad range of topics, including three crucial issues: user acceptance, interaction, and participation. As a result of the weight analysis, computer self-efficacy and perceived ease of use were found to be the best predictors of whether people want to use e-government systems. Performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, and service quality were also found to be promising predictors of satisfaction with e-government services that need more study. Conclusions: This systematic review found a high need for more research on this vast topic, as e-participation is critical to e-government performance and is evolving with ICT. Finally, this study will help academics understand current limitations, obstacles, and gaps, as well as future research opportunities in e-participation.},

abstract = {Purpose – This study aims to explore technology adoption research and propose a trust antecedents model, where trust in government, trust in technology, information quality, Internet familiarity and privacy and security concerns are hypothesized to predict Jordanians trust in e-government. Also, trust in e-government extended the Theory of Reasoned Action in predicting the intention to use e-government.
Design/methodology/approach – Proposed a model and tried to empirically test it using a sample of 759 Jordanians who filled a survey consisting of items measuring the previously mentioned constructs. A structural equation modeling technique was used to test the model.
Findings – Results supported the proposed research model, where all proposed variables significantly predicted intention to use e-government services. Also, a partial least squares estimate of the model indicated a significant prediction of trust in e-government by all proposed variables except the Internet familiarity construct. The coefficient of determination for intention to use was 0.465, and for trust in e-government 0.415.
Research limitations/implications – The study utilized a newly developed instrument in Arabic, and diverse categories of subjects, where some of them were considering a public e-learning system when responding to items.
Practical implications – This research is important to public officials and the Jordanian e-government project, as it emphasized the importance of trust constructs (TiT and TiG) as major influencers on the trust propensity related to e-government. Also, other constructs like information quality showed significant influence; where the type and characteristics of information posted on e-government Web sites influence the adoption decision on the long run. Jordanians' perceptions regarding information posted on e-government Web site were all at moderate levels. More emphasis on making information more accurate, recent, comprehensive and original is needed.
Social implications – This study showed a relative deficiency in Jordanians perceptions towards trusting the Internet. It seems that they reflected a moderate trust in its legal, technical and security levels. Finally, this study emphasized the role of privacy and security issues in influencing the level of trust in e-government systems. Similarly, transparency and knowledge equity are important dimensions that need to be addressed.
Originality/value – This study is one of the largest studies with respect to the size of its sample that explores trust in e-government in Jordan. The focus on trust antecedents and the empirical test of the model is a first attempt in the literature, where a structural model was explored raising the level of accuracy of estimation to its required potential. The number of constructs to be explored at the same time is an addition to the area of e-government technology adoption.},

The article is devoted to the issue of determining the content and structural components of digital participation concept. The problem of the digital technologies' effectiveness for the implementation of civic activity is considered in the context of the practice and experience of foreign organizations in the implementation of digital activism. The author conducts an informal analysis of 46 foreign websites, their content is related to the development of digital participation (government agencies, educational and charitable organizations, digital platforms). The study made it possible to build a structural model of digital participation, including the main subjects, their goals and the necessary conditions / factors of the non-digital and digital environment, as well as the personal component. This is connected with an expanded context in the interpretation of digital participation, which considers the activities of not only the subjects of civic participation itself, but also all other subjects and conditions necessary for the involvement of citizens in digital participation. It is shown that the practice-oriented understanding of digital participation is based on a number of provisions in the documents of international organizations (the United Nations, the European Union) and is based on the assessment through various international indices. The participatory interpretation allows us to conclude that civic participation is extremely positive, based on a culture of participation and consistency in the goals of various social groups and subjects.},

Thus, this study assessed the moderating role of political knowledge in the relationship between Access to Political Information on Facebook and Twitter (APIFT), Political Interest (PI) and Policy Satisfaction (PS) with Online Political Participation on Facebook and Twitter (OPPFT). A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 238 undergraduate students of Universiti Utara Malaysia. Questionnaire was used to collect data which was analysed using Partial Least Squares-MultiGroup Analysis (PLS-MGA). Results revealed that political knowledge moderated the relationship between access to political information on Facebook and Twitter and political interest with youth online political participation on Facebook and Twitter. However, it did not moderate the relationship between policy satisfaction with youth online political participation on Facebook and Twitter. Generally, these findings suggests that political knowledge plays a significant role in youth online political participation in Malaysia. Consequently, this study has added empirical evidence to predictors of political participation while at the same time contributing to the body of knowledge on online political participation.},

abstract = {To develop intelligent and sustainable cities, the government of India launched initiatives like Smart Cities and the Clean Development Mission. Solid waste management (SWM) has become one of the primarily focused areas of such initiatives. The changing dynamics of urban waste characteristics due to unplanned urbanization and rapid growth in urban populations (due to migration) has been a significant concern for local authorities in urban areas to develop an effective SWM plan. The development of a long-term SWM plan along the line of the government initiatives' objectives requires understanding the waste quantities, characteristics, and existing waste management practices. This paper presents an overview of existing waste management activities, financial and institutional demographics in six selected Indian Smart Cities, and the field studies to assess SWM systems as per the waste management rules. The study involved a participatory approach to collect data from local bodies and stakeholders. Indicative strategies for the development of waste management systems were formulated based on the outputs of this analysis. Discussion on pathways includes waste characterization, funding sources, data technologies, and service level benchmarking to plan an integrated solid waste management system for a Smart City. The outcomes of this study shall equip local authorities in designing waste systems to accelerate the transition towards innovative and sustainable waste systems.},

The framework separates three layers: an organization's core activities, its peripheral activities, and its external environment. We find that firms that have come far in their transformations are more embedded in platform ecosystems with unclear business boundaries. Relatedly, we identify a tension between decentralizing versus centralizing power across organizational layers during a firm's digital transformation and how this dynamic affects corporate strategies and firms' internal and external boundaries.},

Built on an integrative review of the literature, this study offers insights into the potential of smart cities and connected communities in facilitating waste management efforts. Shortcomings of existing waste management practices are highlighted and a conceptual framework for a centralized waste management system is proposed, where three interconnected elements are discussed: (1) an infrastructure for proper collection of product lifecycle data to facilitate full visibility throughout the entire lifespan of a product, (2) a set of new business models relied on product lifecycle data to prevent waste generation, and (3) an intelligent sensor-based infrastructure for proper upstream waste separation and on-time collection. The proposed framework highlights the value of product lifecycle data in reducing waste and enhancing waste recovery and the need for connecting waste management practices to the whole product life-cycle. An example of the use of tracking and data sharing technologies for investigating the waste management issues has been discussed. Finally, the success factors for implementing the proposed framework and some thoughts on future research directions have been discussed.},

This study provides a thorough Bibliometric analysis from 1122 papers focused on the Scopus database of published microcontroller research, from the first year the Arduino keyword appeared in 2008 until 2022. Various science articles indexed by Scopus and referring to the use of Arduino MCBs are selected. The Bibliometric analysis explores comprehensive and general key attributes that form a trend from the Scopus articles based on authors, titles, publication years, keywords, citations, affiliations, abstracts, funding information, and languages. The generated data is visualized and analyzed to find patterns that appear within the time span. This study found a significant increase in the number of articles on Arduino boards in Biology, Physics, Chemistry, Science, and STEM category of the paper. Despite using only the Scopus database, this study opens up to view the direction of the growing application of Arduino boards in Science. The use of Bibliometric analysis maps the scientific implementation of Arduino boards as an extensive guide for future collaborations in education and industry.},

abstract = {Addressing urban sustainability challenges requires changes in the way systems of provision and services are designed, organised and delivered. In this context, two promising phenomena have gained interest from the academia, the public sector and the media: “smart cities” and “urban sharing”. Smart cities rely on the extensive use of information and communications technology (ICT) to increase efficiencies in urban areas, while urban sharing builds on the collaborative use of idling resources enabled by ICT in densely populated cities. The concepts have many similar features and share common goals, yet cities with smart city agendas often fail to take a stance on urban sharing. Thus, its potentials are going largely unnoticed by local governments. This article addresses this issue by exploring cases of London and Berlin–two ICT-dense cities with clearly articulated smart city agendas and an abundance of sharing platforms. Drawing on urban governance literature, we develop a conceptual framework that specifies the roles that cities assume when governing urban sharing: city as regulator, city as provider, city as enabler and city as consumer. We find that both cities indirectly support urban sharing through smart agenda programmes, which aim to facilitate ICT-enabled technical innovation and emergence of start-ups. However, programmes, strategies, support schemes and regulations aimed directly at urban sharing initiatives are few. We also find that Berlin is sceptical towards urban sharing organisations, while London took more of a collaborative approach. Implications for policy-makers are discussed in the end.},

In this paper, we specify and focus on the role of city-based, public-affiliated intermediaries as initiators, moderators and influencers of conversations between startups and the local government. The main contribution of SiR as a PPI intermediation programme has been to launch new types of fruitful conversations on several levels, that lead to institutional innovations rather than direct solutions for urban problems or startup development. In this sense, SiR fulfils a role inquiring and ascribing urban challenges with values and notions of “worth” that preceded and shaped innovation directions. We also suggest that engaging startups is effective for only a limited bandwidth urban challenges; different types of intermediation are required to foster collaborative innovation in more complex settings.},

In this framework, the smart city is actually a popular vision in discourses on urban development. This paper explores alternative ways in which citizens are positioned within different imaginaries of the smart city. The premise is that most mainstream discourses implicitly assume that smart city projects will empower and improve the lives of citizens. However, their role is often ambiguous. While some visions of the smart city are characterised by the absence of citizen's voices, others are populated by active citizens operating as urban sensors. Furthermore there are fearful visions of a future in which citizens will be subjugated by technologies that will hamper their freedom. This paper analyses the role of citizens in four alternative smart city imaginaries. The thesis proposed is that all four imaginaries are characterised by citizens playing a subaltern role, and hence the smart city is a relatively poor concept if intended as a model of the urban life of the future.},

abstract = {In this book, Verba, Schlozman and Brady investigate political participation and its processes in the United States. A healthy democracy is conditioned on participation and the processes that determine who is given voice and how much. Using an assessment approach to the representativeness of participation that is broader than voting, including contributions, volunteerism, and contacts to officials, the authors explore the barriers to and adequacy of representation. The authors present a conception of the participatory process - the Civic Volunteerism Model. They focus on the components of motivation and capacity, but also consider the issue of recruitment. People can be expected not to participate for reasons that fall in three categories: they won't (engagement), they can't (resources), or no one asked (recruitment). Since participation is voluntary, the process involves choice; that choice, however, is constrained by resources. Therefore, the model demostrated that the resources factor is the strongest determinant for participation. Resources affecting the likelihood of participation are a of collection factors - including income, education, time, and civic skills. Civic skills, interestingly, are usually obtained in nonpolitical settings such as church or an organization. Given the rise in campaign spending, the authors make careful distinctions between giving time and giving money. Verba, Schlozman and Brady stress that many social characteristics, such as poverty and education level, are often bundled with minority groups. Since education and income are causally related to participatory activities or are 'participation factors,' a disproportionately fewer number of messages are coming minority groups. Further, the homogenity of the group influences the complexity of representation; public representation may be sufficient from one perspective, but quite insufficient from another. In this way participation factors also create distortion in those elected to represent a group – representation distortion. This can manifest itself descriptively or substantively, with a representative either being unlike their constituents ethnically and culturally or showing policy preferences that do not reflect the needs of their constituency. For example, a wealthy, well-educated young African American woman is likely not the best representative for a target group of lower income, high school attainment, single mothers who also happen to be African American. Nonetheless, those with higher education or income are more likely to be recruited to take part in politics.},

abstract = {Recently proliferating ‘smart city' building efforts have lent themselves well to interpretations through the lens of the policy mobilities literature. Applying this perspective, studies have insightfully shown how policymaking centred around smart cities is at once a messy, networked process stretching across scales, while also manifesting itself in concrete practices shaped by territorial–regulatory contexts. Informed by empirical research on smart city policies in Hungary and the Netherlands, this paper argues that the policy mobilities approach tends to overemphasize the global and the local. Notwithstanding the transnational circulation of smart city ideas, the national scale continues being reproduced by these ideas as a relevant scale of urban regulation, discursive framing and strategy-making under globalization. To acknowledge this, and to move towards a more decidedly multiscalar perspective on actually existing smart urbanisms, it is suggested that we incorporate the national scale, understood as a relational set of practices and discourses, more explicitly into our analysis. Insights from the Hungarian and Dutch case studies are used to illustrate the manifold ways in which the local embedding of the globally mobile smart city concept is shaped by the national scale, as well as how the national itself is being renegotiated in this process.},

abstract = {Notions of the smart city are pervasive in urban development discourses. Various frameworks for the development of smart cities, often conceptualised as roadmaps, make a number of implicit claims about how smart city projects proceed but the legitimacy of those claims is unclear. This paper begins to address this gap in knowledge. We explore the development of a smart transport application, MotionMap, in the context of a {\pounds}16M smart city programme taking place in Milton Keynes, UK. We examine how the idealised smart city narrative was locally inflected, and discuss the differences between the narrative and the processes and outcomes observed in Milton Keynes. The research shows that the vision of data-driven efficiency outlined in the roadmaps is not universally compelling, and that different approaches to the sensing and optimisation of urban flows have potential for empowering or disempowering different actors. Roadmaps tend to emphasise the importance of delivering quick practical results. However, the benefits observed in Milton Keynes did not come from quick technical fixes but from a smart city narrative that reinforced existing city branding, mobilising a growing network of actors towards the development of a smart region. Further research is needed to investigate this and other smart city developments, the significance of different smart city narratives, and how power relationships are reinforced and constructed through them.},

abstract = {Undertaking a review of the literature is an important part of any research project. The researcher both maps and assesses the relevant intellectual territory in order to specify a research question which will further develop the knowledge base. However, traditional 'narrative' reviews frequently lack thoroughness, and in many cases are not undertaken as genuine pieces of investigatory science. Consequently they can lack a means for making sense of what the collection of studies is saying. These reviews can be biased by the researcher and often lack rigour. Furthermore, the use of reviews of the available evidence to provide insights and guidance for intervention into operational needs of practitioners and policymakers has largely been of secondary importance. For practitioners, making sense of a mass of often-contradictory evidence has become progressively harder. The quality of evidence underpinning decision-making and action has been questioned, for inadequate or incomplete evidence seriously impedes policy formulation and implementation. In exploring ways in which evidence-informed management reviews might be achieved, the authors evaluate the process of systematic review used in the medical sciences. Over the last fifteen years, medical science has attempted to improve the review process by synthesizing research in a systematic, transparent, and reproducible manner with the twin aims of enhancing the knowledge base and informing policymaking and practice. This paper evaluates the extent to which the process of systematic review can be applied to the management field in order to produce a reliable knowledge stock and enhanced practice by developing context-sensitive research.

abstract = {This paper contributes to the literature on social sustainability in urban governance, with a focus on how this concept may be integrated into a Smart City strategy, so that excessive enthusiasm for smart technologies does not lead to neglect of the social implications of certain policies or programmes. By relying on a case study-based analysis, this work explores the path followed by the municipal government of Milan, and shows that integration of social sustainability into the Smart City strategy can be pursued by focusing both on the ‘content' and the ‘process' of strategy building. Rather than playing a strong leadership role, the planning department on the internal front and the entire municipality on the external front have chosen a role based on co-creation with citizens and other relevant stakeholders. The benefits of this approach may include the bottom-up character of several projects, better responsiveness and greater opportunities for different categories of actors; the drawbacks may include greater difficulty in ensuring that certain objective are reached (e.g. in terms of fairness and representativeness) and a higher risk of the dispersion of resources. This case also points to the difficulty of assessing the social sustainability of multiple rather than individual projects and programmes combined in a Smart City strategy: projects may reinforce each other in their social impact, or otherwise hinder possible benefits; also, a municipality may choose a combination of smart projects and programmes that attach different weights to economic, environmental and social sustainability objectives.},

In this article, we examine the iterative design of this technology as well as its introduction into the everyday practices of cyclists. We argue that efforts to quantify the ordinary experience of cycling were overwhelmed and interrupted by an ecology of breakdowns, everyday contingencies, forgetfulness, and re-interpretations in the assemblage of devices, data, humans, and bicycles. These breakdowns generated incoherent or absurd bits of information that we call them as “idiotic data” based on recent conceptualizations of the character of the idiot. Significant displacements were provoked by these idiotic data, forcing the engineer behind the device to control and purify the sample by design and algorithms, waning the civic nature of the project at the same time. The case shows how new ways of knowing the urban space by smart devices should be not separated from the emergence of idiotic data, putting into question the versions of citizen participation and smartness at stakes.},

abstract = {While scholars critique the first-generation of the corporate smart city for failing to tackle people-oriented agendas and authentically respond to the needs of residents, many point to a potential to move beyond narrow environmental and economic objectives and tackle social issues. But concrete empirical evidence of this potential is visibly lacking. In parallel, researchers have brought attention to the emergence of the so-called ‘smart city 2.0'. This is framed as a decentralised, people-centric approach where smart technologies are employed as tools to tackle social problems, address resident needs and foster collaborative participation. This contrasts to the techno-economic and centralised approach of the dominating ‘smart city 1.0' or first-generation paradigm, which is primarily focused on diffusing smart technologies for corporate and economic interests. Utilising this dichotomy as an analytical framework, this paper examines Aizuwakamatsu Smart City in Fukushima, Japan to demonstrate how a smart city can be framed and implemented as a tool for tackling endogenous social challenges. Findings unearth a myriad of novel approaches to utilising data and ICT to respond to resident needs, improve livelihoods and widely share smart city benefits. Yet they also point to a need to transcend polarised discourses around alternative models of smart cities and appreciate the messy reality of hybrid, on-the-ground smart urbanisation and the co-existence of contrasting yet complementary visions and approaches.},

(2) When—under what conditions—are citizens able to alter the trajectory of urban development? By analyzing cases through the concept of “pragmatic registers”, we show how residents, developers and civil servants can bend citizen participation—and its material arrangements from workshops and public meetings to contracts and policy documents—to serve their own purposes. The organizational and legal tools used in urban planning, we argue, privilege entrepreneurial citizens who are active, flexible and possess negotiating know-how. Participatory processes (re)produce moral categories, with entrepreneurial residents seen as the “good” residents who henceforth become the focus of urban policy. These categories, however, can be challenged by other residents who mobilize support from politicians, the media and courts.

abstract = {In response to the mounting criticism of emerging ‘smart cities' strategies around the world, a number of individuals and institutions have attempted to pivot from discussions of smart cities towards a focus on ‘smart citizens'. While the smart citizen is most often seen as a kind of foil for those more stereotypically top-down, neoliberal and repressive visions of the smart city that have been widely critiqued within the literature, this paper argues for an attention to the ‘actually existing smart citizen', who plays a much messier and more ambivalent role in practice. This paper proposes the dual figures of ‘the general citizen' and ‘the absent citizen' as a heuristic for thinking about how the lines of inclusion and exclusion are drawn for citizens, both discursively and materially, in the actual making of the smart city. These figures are meant to highlight how the universal and unspecified figure of ‘the citizen' is discursively deployed to justify smart city policies, while at the same time, actual citizens remain largely excluded from such decision and policy-making processes. Using a case study of Atlanta, Georgia and its ongoing smart cities initiatives, we argue that while the participation of citizens is crucial to any truly democratic mode of urban governance, the emerging discourse around the promise of smart citizenship fails to capture the realities of how citizens are actually discussed and enrolled in the making of these policies.},

It refers to the process that allows organizations to alter their path dependence by transforming their strategic intent and capabilities. With contributions from an increasing range of theoretical perspectives and research contexts, the strategic renewal literature has become fragmented and lacks common definitions and conceptual clarity, which prevent cross-fertilization and harm further development. This study systematically reviews the various literature streams on strategic renewal to provide a more integrative perspective. The authors identify three key theoretical tensions at the heart of strategic renewal research, namely learning vs. resource, induced vs. autonomous, and co-alignment vs. co-creation. By exploring these key tensions, the authors define strategic renewal's conceptual core, identify gaps in the past literature, and provide guidance for future research.},

abstract = {Investments through the 2014–2020 European structural funds pursue goals of smart, inclusive and sustainable growth, while many towns and cities in Europe are shrinking rather than growing. Policy makers and practitioners therefore face challenges in ensuring that places with very limited growth potential will not fall further behind. While scholars argue that cities in long-term decline would benefit from enhancing their capacity to develop collaborative initiatives that draw on local resources and assets, in practice local decision makers seem to struggle to engage their communities in the fight against the causes and consequences of decline. This paper advances the argument that the concept of co-production is well suited to explore and explain how collaborative actions unlock new strategic choices that are based on capabilities and resources over which local actors have control. A case study from a small manufacturing town in Germany is used to illustrate how co-production at different levels can lead to tangible, long-term improvements in a context of ongoing shrinkage.},

From a managerial point of view, there is scant research on how to select public partners in Smart City projects. In fact, while there are several cities claiming to be ‘smart', not all cities fulfil the essential requirements for successful Smart City projects. This paper shows how to build successful public–private alliances in Smart Cities and, more specifically, how to select the right city to test, develop or sell smart technologies. This study uses a multiple-case research design and follows an exploratory and qualitative methodology. The results show that firms improve the success of their projects if they assess three main aspects of partner selection, these being partner complementarity, commitment and compatibility. The paper, therefore, provides several managerial implications regarding how firms may be more effective in selecting where to start their Smart City projects and how public organisations may become more attractive. Finally, academic implications, limitations and future lines of research are presented.},

This article argues that, in spite of the common wisdom within critical urban scholarship looking at the smart city as a policy framework aligned with the interests of powerful private and public actors such as multinational corporations and the state, the smart city model of local economic regeneration and governance goes beyond this, nurturing a process of capitalist variegation, which comprises multinational high-tech firms but is not limited to them. Thanks to its adaptability, the smart city narrative can be applied to a variety of strategies of economic revitalization, as showed by the case of Turin in Italy analysed here: a constellation of initiatives including start-up innovative firms, infrastructure projects and the social economy. The article argues that this variegated economics of the smart city offers still unexplored opportunities for a ‘potential politics' of smart urbanism, aimed at appropriating the gains of technology for a future of urban social justice.},

By analyzing personal experience as well as the historical antecedents of coproduction, we argue that the site of coproduction is defined by the legacy of the Enlightenment and its notions of “reason” and “the cognitive subject.” We show the enduring impact of these notions in producing and perpetuating the power dynamics between professionals, researchers, policy makers and service users within privileged sites of knowledge production, whereby those deemed to lack reason—the mad and the racialized mad in particular—and their knowledge are radically inferiorised. Articulating problems in what is considered knowledge and methods of knowing, we argue that modern “psy” sciences instantiates the privilege of reason as well as of whiteness. We then examine how the survivor movement, and the emergent survivor/mad knowledge base, duplicates white privilege even as it interrogates privileges of reason and cognition. Describing how we grapple with these issues in an ongoing project—EURIKHA—which aims to map the knowledge produced by service users, survivors and persons with psychosocial disabilities globally, we offer some suggestions. Coproduction between researchers, policy makers and those of us positioned as mad, particularly as mad people of color, we argue, cannot happen in knowledge production environments continuing to operate within assumptions and philosophies that privilege reason as well as white, Eurocentric thinking. We seek not to coproduce but to challenge and change thinking and support for psychosocial suffering in contexts local to people's lives.},

This article contends that smart governance is a critical factor in urban technological transformation processes. Smart governance aims at improving urban management through enhanced data-informed decision-making and the commensurate inclusion and participation of civic actors in this process. Drawing on interviews with administrators in three South African secondary cities, the analysis highlights the complex challenges that limit the effective inculcation of smart governance practices in these cities. It focuses specifically on the strategic, organisational and political challenges of municipal administrations, and the obstacles to effective interaction between key actors in developing an effective municipal data-technology ecosystem. In doing so, this article contributes new insights into enhanced governance practices in smartening secondary cities; it initiates a critical inquiry on the uneven ways these small, less resourced and socio-economically contentious cities negotiate complex social, administrative and political dynamics in incipient processes of urban smartening.},

abstract = {Two of the most striking features of smart city discourses are the centrality of technology as a driver of transformational change and the strange ‘placelessness' of its visual narrative. Whether envisaged in Kenya or Singapore, the commercial smart city is represented as a ‘city in a box', seemingly capable of solving complex social issues through algorithms and technical innovation. Recently a robust literature has emerged that is critical of the techno-determinism inherent in smart city discussions. This paper expands on this critique by arguing that by solely focusing on the material dimensions of technologically informed urban change, devoid of context, we miss an opportunity to uncover an important moment in contemporary urbanity. By foregrounding the human dimensions of technology appropriation and the interface with livelihoods in their particular spatial contexts, this paper consciously decentres the dominant smart city discourse by arguing for the foregrounding of local dynamics. This paper rejects the universalisms embedded in smart city promises and argues that by provincialising the idea of smart urbanism, opportunities are presented for understanding the true markers of contemporary urbanism. Critical debates on the smart city, and by extension the need to consider smart urbanism contextually and as an infrastructure, relationally, together with the conceptual insights provided by postcolonial science and technology studies, contribute to a proposed frame for researching the ongoing dynamic between contemporary urban life and technological innovation. Empirical vignettes from urban Africa are used to illustrate the multiple dimensions of the interface between livelihoods and technology appropriation.},

The need to adapt to an increasingly global and dynamic context is fundamental to cities' survival and development trajectories. Nonetheless, how this goal should be met and how the ‘smart' dimension in cities impacts the social, economic and urban levels are still subject to debate. In the present paper, we focus on the relationship between the ‘smart living' dimension, which includes integrative, inclusive and social practices, and the promotion of a local entrepreneurial environment by considering the moderating role of intra- and international human capital inflow. Using a GLS method and a panel dataset that includes 30 cities, we demonstrate that the relationship tends to be an inverted U-shaped curve, contributing to the discussion on the impact of smart cities' social policies on entrepreneurship in urban contexts. Furthermore, we highlight that human capital inflow positively moderates this relationship, showing that intra- and international human capital flows contribute differently in this regard, producing divergent effects. We conclude with implications for academics and policymakers, and practical and theoretical suggestions.},

This article is composed as an early analysis of the air quality sensing project as a framework for the larger smart city story of Christchurch. It provides an overview of the experiences and lessons learned about the implementation of new technologies in a post-disaster environment. We examine how the narrative of the smart city is constructed, with focus on the terminology used by citizens, academicians, government and corporations. We then argue that top-down technocratic solutions to urban problems alone do not suffice to improve life in the city; rather, they can result in misaligned expectations or outcomes for stakeholders at the government and citizen level. We conclude by suggesting that citizen-led initiatives may be a way to promote more nuanced and inclusive ways of addressing local urban problems in a smart cities context.},

Linking the empirical case study of the ‘top-down' implementation of SmartCity Cologne, Germany, to current ‘bottom-up' discourses on reclaiming the urban commons, we show how ‘true' and ‘real' social innovation must go hand-in-hand with a re-politicisation of hegemonic logics and discursive framings. In doing so, this paper makes theoretical and empirical contributions to public and academic discourse on which governance practices, methods and policies could contribute to radical transformations towards a ‘truly' smart and sustainable urban future.},

abstract = {This paper builds on institutional theory to understand the role that the institutional environment plays in emerging economies which encourage citizens to create Internet of Things (IoT)-based interventions. The research included a field-based study in Hyderabad, a south Indian smart city, using a qualitative explorative research methodology. The research found that, although a supportive regulatory environment helps to create a positive regulatory and cognitive institutional context, normative institutions continue to discourage the positive environment that this context has created. Such a scenario may lead to a ‘talent-in and talent-out' situation that reduces the entrepreneurial potential of the cities. Thus, city governments in emerging economies need to focus on building not only a regulatory environment, but also create a conducive environment for the key stakeholders in the ecosystem to encourage and promote citizen-led IoT interventions that would result in building inclusive smart cities.},

However, there is a lack of comparative studies of smart governance in different institutional contexts. This study develops a framework for comparing smart governance in different institutional and technological contexts. Comparative and discourse analyses are conducted to understand the similarities and differences of smart governance practices in selected Western countries and China. A key finding of this study is that different institutions have largely affected smart governance strategies, arrangements and outcomes. Smart governance is tightly linked with e-governance and e-democracy in some Western countries, while it officially emphasizes smart management and service in China. A common aspect is that the increasing use of social media, smartphones, portals, crowdsourcing platforms, and planning support systems have generally promoted smart governments and services, e-participation, and wider collaboration through both top-down and bottom-up approaches. This could lead to gradual changes in government organizations, new relations between governments, the private sector and citizens, and improvements in the city.},

abstract = {Smart city approaches in city planning have gained significant momentum in the recent past. While proponents argue that smart cities will bring positive social change by the adoption of ICTs, enriched governance and human capital among the citizenry, opponents point out about the negative effects and gaps exist in their planning and execution. Despite efforts to promote its practice, there has been wide criticism about the concept and the way it has been adopted and implemented. The roles of various players, especially the central role of the private sector, is often challenged in the academic literature. A variety of expectations from various stakeholders make the potential implementation strategies even more complex. The current paper reviews the research in the field to date to find that there are conflicting views in smart city planning, which limit our knowledge about the ‘real' smart city and its implications for building creative and inclusive urban space. Such uncertainty at the conceptual level, and the heightened importance given by policy makers and markets to its adoption, highlights the need for proper scrutiny. The paper clusters the various views pertaining to the building of smart cities and, thereby, proposes a 3RC framework, consisting of Restrictive, Reflective, Rationalistic and Critical schools, which critically analyses various stages in the development of the field. The overall aim of the paper is to understand how smart cities differ in their meanings, intentions and ‘offerings'.},

abstract = {Public administration scholars separate over whether the public bureaucracy or the democratic polity ought to be the starting point of public admin-istration scholarship. Dwight Waldo (1948), John J. Kirlin (1996), and Vincent Ostrom (1997) among others, have argued that the democratic polity needs preference and that focusing predominantly on improving efficiency of administrative processes can in fact harm the very polity that such improvements are supposed to help. Procedural due process, sub-stantive rights, equity, and protection of minority rights as well as equal opportunity and equality among citizens are values that have precedence over efficiency. They argue, and I agree, that a particular public bureaucracy or administrative structure is embedded within a particular political socioeconom-ic system. If the result desired is an inclusive, demo-cratic polity, then these organizations ought to be grounded in theories, assumptions, and understand-ings of reality that advance knowledge of, and give direction toward, attaining such a polity. Grounded in rational choice and public choice and containing elements of Total Quality Manage-ment (TQM), the New Public Management (NPM) seeks to offer more efficient mechanisms for deliver-ing goods and services and for raising governmental performance levels. Such a goal would appear to be highly commendable and desired by all citizens. As Parsons, Merrick, and Watson (1996, 26) in their study of Deep South mayors note, "The social con-tract, in large part, is about the equitable distribution of city resources." The Civil Rights Movement con-cerned equal services in terms of sewers, paved roads, and street lights as well as equality in voting, jobs, and education. -^ The purpose of this article is to examine the impli-cations of the new public management movement for representative bureaucracies and the development of an inclusive democratic polity. In examining these matters, I will first define an inclusive democratic polity and examine the extent to which the theory and assumptions that undergird the New Public Management are likely to provide guidance to those implementing it should they wish to promote an inclusive democratic polity. Since the NPM is largely derived from rational choice and public choice theo-ries, I will focus primarily on them. 201 However, I will also note briefly how TQM has modified these theories. After assessing these theoretical issues, I will then discuss the meaning and rationale for a representative bureaucracy. Once these basic concepts are articulated, I will suggest how a representa-tive bureaucracy might assist in resolving the problems facing the NPM as the result of trying to apply private sector and market concepts to the public sector.},

Part of these strategies is to develop new types of innovation approaches in urban areas, which are characterized, firstly, by a high level of citizen involvement in co-creating Internet-based applications in all sectors of the economy and society; secondly, by the emergence of new forms of collaboration among local governments, research institutes, universities, and companies. Such strategies and the resulting "innovation ecosystems" are becoming increasingly relevant given the growing economic and social issues and opportunities that cities are currently facing. This special issue investigates these smart city strategies through four smart city case studies and two papers addressing horizontal issues. The case studies aim to analyze the currently emerging strategies and policies related to identify how the opportunities of the Future Internet are being used for the socio-economic development of urban areas. The four cases also address how cities are redefining their innovation structures and how they started to experiment citizens involvement within the context of open innovation, and present lessons learned that are of interest to smart city stakeholders. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

This paper focuses on the former and, drawing on a number of examples, details how cities are being instrumented with digital devices and infrastructure that produce 'big data'. Such data, smart city advocates argue enables real-time analysis of city life, new modes of urban governance, and provides the raw material for envisioning and enacting more efficient, sustainable, competitive, productive, open and transparent cities. The final section of the paper provides a critical reflection on the implications of big data and smart urbanism, examining five emerging concerns: the politics of big urban data, technocratic governance and city development, corporatisation of city governance and technological lock-ins, buggy, brittle and hackable cities, and the panoptic city. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

Both theory and practice are dominated by ambivalence about the idea of participation itself. Both struggle with dilemmas that make the problems seem insoluble, such as the conflict between the individual and collective interest or between the ideal of democracy and the reality that many voices are never heard. Cases are used to draw on an emerging set of practices of collaborative public engagement from around the world to demonstrate how alternative methods can better meet public participation goals and how they make moot most of the dilemmas of more conventional practice. Research shows that collaborative participation can solve complex, contentious problems such as budget decision making and create an improved climate for future action when bitter disputes divide a community. Authentic dialogue, networks and institutional capacity are the key elements. The authors propose that participation should be understood as a multi-way set of interactions among citizens and other players who together produce outcomes. Next steps involve developing an alternative practice framework, creating forums and arenas, adapting agency decision processes, and providing training and financial support. {\textcopyright} 2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd.},

Due to its lack of definitional precision, not to mention an underlying self-congratulatory tendency, the main thrust of this article is to provide a preliminary critical polemic against some of the more rhetorical aspects of smart cities.

Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are established as drivers of this new wave of change in the redefinition of the relationship between the city and its citizens. Smart Cities rely strongly on strategies and solutions enabled by ICTs involving directly local governments, citizens and communities. Open data alone, though a relevant component of these strategies, cannot provide enough incentives for the engagement of citizens necessary to establish a collaborative and open governance system; data need to be appropriately elaborated, communicated and used. The main objective of this paper is to investigate how open data together with simple and standardised elaborations and innovative visualisation techniques may be used to provide new and updated services to citizens and communities: free and readily available services based on the wealth of information ‘owned' by local governments. Adopting a design science research methodology we develop and test a collaborative ICT-based tool called UrbanSense. We use it to highlight how systemic connections between citizens and city-government may be devised. On this point, the focus is on the feedforwarding of open data integrated with basic elaborations and visualisations as a means for the local government to create new and open services for citizens and communities. The use of the services prompts citizens to feedback new information in real-time to the city government. These interactions may be used to foster an open innovation ecosystem.},

The social science literature has been critical toward urban smartness, with most of the empirical research focusing on the politics of data-driven and entrepreneurial urbanism. This article seeks to contribute to this debate by empirically examining the role that sustainability plays in the smart city discourse. Its distinctive approach is to investigate how urban smartness and sustainability are framed by an authoritative institution (the European Union) and then to trace these framings down to a particular city (Stavanger, Norway). The data show that the smartness approach is strongly tied to innovation, technology, and economic entrepreneurialism, and sustainability does not appear to be a very important motivating driver. Nevertheless, the ‘sustainability component' of the smart city agenda becomes clearer the closer we come to the city level.},

Based on a survey and content analysis of 146 peer-reviewed academic articles from 18 journals over the 14-year period 2000-2013, this paper systematically reviews the existing applications of general theories (such as legitimacy theory, the resource-based view and Habermasian political theory) within the political CSR literature. The survey indicates that the political CSR field is dominated by institutional theory and stakeholder theory, but future theory development needs to go beyond these theories in order to address a number of critical gaps. This review specifically points to several avenues for future political CSR research with regard to the individual level of analysis, domain integration and political CSR in multinational enterprises. The paper ends with a call for a new theory-informed and pluralist research agenda on political CSR to integrate different perspectives and re-examine the role of the state.},

abstract = {In a longitudinal qualitative study of a water stewardship council, we build theory about how and why actors embedded in disparate logics across multiple fields can overcome the constraints of their home logics to construct a new, shared governance logic together. Our findings suggest a recursive model of new logic construction in which council members mobilize three emotional facilitators (social emotions, moral emotions, and emotional energy) to affect three logic-construction cycles (agreeing on values, shared learning, and enacting shared values). Emotional facilitators work through three agentic mechanisms: enabling actors to become open and reflexive about their home logics and simultaneously increase their commitment to and engagement in constructing a shared governance logic. Ongoing interactions involving emotional facilitators, agentic mechanisms, and logicconstruction cycles are essential in sustaining the new logic. The processmodel foregrounds the role of emotions in enabling dually embedded agency, thereby extending extant theory that has tended to focus narrowly on cognitive dynamics. We discuss implications for our understanding of institutional agency, the role of emotions in new logic construction, and the role of microlevel interactions in the formation of macrolevel structures.},

Drawing on previous definitions and operationalisations, a new typology for political participation and civic engagement is developed, highlighting the multidimensionality of both concepts. In particular, it makes a clear distinction between manifest “political participation” (including formal political behaviour as well as protest or extra-parliamentary political action) and less direct or “latent” forms of participation, conceptualized here as “civic engagement” and “social involvement”. The article argues that the notion of “latent” forms of participation is crucial to understand new forms of political behaviour and the prospects for political participation in different countries. Due to these innovations it contributes to a much-needed theoretical development within the literature on political participation and citizen engagement.},

Yet critics contend that the benefits of investment and (re)development programs are not shared equally and there is need for better understanding diverse lived experiences of community members. This paper highlights local voices and lived experiences amid physical and social change in downtown Kitchener, Ontario, Canada, a city that is actively pursuing a smart city agenda. Drawing on data collected from a community workshop that included representatives from local government, technology and start-up sectors, community service providers, and community activists, we adopt a Creative Analytic Practice (CAP) approach and present a set of hybrid vignettes centered on the experiences of these stakeholder groups. The vignettes highlight differing expectations for the role of technology in promoting quality of life and illustrate a struggle to translate aspirations for collaboration and equity into on-the-ground action. We argue that CAP is an effective tool for presenting and enhancing the inclusiveness and accessibility of smart city discussions and debates.},

In response to common dilemmas of public engagement, public servants working in this area in Canada show clear patterns in terms of their reactions to time pressure and inclusion/exclusion considerations, but appear divided on how to resolve dilemmas as they relate to representation and public resistance–the two dilemmas with more political dimensions. These findings suggest that public servants working in this realm exhibit an adaptability and political sensitivity to the particular public engagement issue area and scenario presented to them, rather than relying upon idealized models of public engagement.},

Work on analysing the crafting of ‘actually existing' smart cities has turned to describing and characterising the processes through which smart cities are made and, within this, the interplay and relative significance of accidental versus purposeful smart cities has come to the fore. Drawing on the concept of dispositif to capture the simultaneity of piecemeal and opportunistic change with deliberate strategy, this paper furthers these debates using examples of two places within the Sydney Metropolitan Region, Australia: Newcastle and Parramatta. Through their analysis we identify the evolving interplay of a priori drivers, ad hoc initiatives and post hoc strategies evident in the crafting of smart cities. Understanding the emergence of actually existing smart cities, we conclude, is sharpened and strengthened by the concept of dispositif, through its attention to processes characterised by non-linear, overlapping and recursively combined drivers that are not without purposeful, strategic intent.},

These characteristics are challenged in the academic literature, especially the technocentric approach and the central position of private companies. Moreover, the lack of proper conceptualisation pushes cities to claim themselves ‘smart'. Finally, there are few rigorous analytical or statistical analyses of the concept and its application to territories. Therefore, this paper studies how Belgian municipalities understand the concept of Smart Cities in 2016. Based on the groundwork of literature on Smart Cities and the results of a survey of 113 Belgian municipalities, a typology of four understandings of the Smart City (technological, societal, comprehensive and non-existent) is elaborated. The results also show that municipalities with no understanding of the Smart City concept or with a technical understanding are mostly located in small and rural municipalities. This could be a sign of rejection of the phenomenon in this context. Conversely, medium and large-sized municipalities mostly develop a societal or comprehensive understanding. Therefore, this study highlights a dichotomy of understanding and acceptance of the concept of the Smart City between peripheral (rural and small size municipalities) and central municipalities (urban, medium and large size municipalities).},

We assess not only the level of empirical support for the theory, but also the degree of paradigm consensus present in the empirical literature. Our analysis shows that results are mixed: while we found support in some areas (e.g., with regard to asset specificity), we also found considerable disagreement on how to operationalize some of TCE's central constructs and propositions, and relatively low levels of empirical support in other core areas (e.g., surrounding uncertainty and performance). We conclude that a more thorough empirical grounding of the theory's foundation is crucial to its future development, and offer several strategies for doing this.

Integrating urban and digital planning, smart cities are being marketed across the world as solutions to the challenges of urbanization and sustainable development. In India, in particular, there has been a move towards building 100 new smart cities in the future in order to spur economic growth and urbanization. Using the case of Dholera, the first Indian smart city, I examine how global models of smart cities are provincialized in the regional state of Gujarat through local histories, politics and laws. First, I argue that Dholera smart city is part of a longer genealogy of utopian urban planning that emerged as a response to the challenges of development and modernity in post-independent India. Second, that Dholera highlights a shift towards an ‘entrepreneurial urbanization' in a regional state interested in scaling up a ‘Gujarat model of development' for emulation at the scale of the nation. Finally, that in Dholera ‘speed' is a relative term across its scales of manifestation from the global to local, where short ‘bursts of speed' in conceptualization and investment is matched by significant ‘bottlenecks' via local protests. The article concludes that Dholera's fault lines are built into its utopian imaginings, which prioritizes urbanization as a business model rather than a model of social justice.},

We conducted an in-depth field study of nine software development teams that included 132 ethnographic initial interviews, periods of team observation, 19 follow-up interviews, and team meetings. Inductive analysis of the data led us to develop an embedded model of cultural adaptation in global teams to describe the process we observed as teams attempted to cope with important differences in interpersonal communication styles, preferred approaches to organizational control and authority relations, and workrelated knowledge and problem-solving approaches. We show how local embeddedness and interdependence across sites together drive cultural adaptation dialectics as actors attempt to resolve rippling tensions within and across nested social structures. The model of cultural adaptation that we developed as an outcome of our research challenges literature that assumes adaptation can be contained within a team and is distinctive in incorporating a dynamic systems view of culture. We build on and develop theory concerning multilevel structuration dynamics.

The final goal is to improve the quality of city life for all stakeholders. Until now, SCs have been developing as bottom-up projects, bringing together smart initiatives driven by public bodies, enterprises, citizens, and not-for-profit organizations. However, to build a long-term smart strategy capable of producing better returns from investments and deciding priorities regarding each city, a comprehensive SC governance framework is needed. The aim of this paper is to collect empirical evidences regarding government structures implemented in SCs and to outline a framework for the roles of local governments, nongovernmental agencies, and administrative officials. The survey shows that no consolidated standards or best practices for governing SCs are implemented in the examined cities; however, each city applies its own governance framework. Moreover, the study reveals some interesting experiences that may be useful for involving citizens and civil society in SC governance.},

A literature review on the key areas of smart communities was performed to identify a gap in extant research related to the scarcity of studies examining the strategic role of governance in communities. Then, the main ecosystems elements were introduced to show the suitability of this theory for the introduction of an integrated view based on multi-level governance and service ecosystems. Findings from the case study on the TrentoSmartCity allowed the development of a theoretical framework that identified the main drivers for sustainable growth in smart communities by showing the need to introduce a meta-level to address the harmonizing role of governance. Thus, the study detected, firstly, the main ecosystem's elements involved in Trento communities and, secondly, how multi-level governance could strategically manage these elements for the harmonization of multi-stakeholder's objectives to attain social growth. The identification of the strategic drivers for sustainable development in smart communities as well as the main decision-making and policy-making steps could help scholars and practitioners shed light on the key role of entrepreneurship and governance in the development of sustainable innovation.},

This article, however, positions the smart city as significant in its implicit rejection of the strong normativity of traditional technologies of planning, in favour of an ontology of efficiency and emergence. It explores a series of prominent UK smart city initiatives (in Bristol, Manchester and Milton Keynes) as bundles of experimental local practices, drawing on the literature pointing to a growing valorisation of the ‘experimental' over strong policy commitments in urban governance. It departs from this literature, however, by reading contemporary ‘smart experiments' through Shapin and Schafer's work on the emergence of 17th-century science, to advance a transhistorical understanding of experimentation as oriented towards societal reordering. From this perspective, the UK smart city merits attention primarily as an indicator of a wider set of shifts in approaches to governance. Its pragmatic orientation sits uneasily alongside ambitions to ‘standardise' smart and sustainable urban development; and raises questions about the conscious overlap between the stated practical ambitions of smart city initiatives and pre-existing environmental and social policies.},

We integrated resource dependence, social embeddedness, and citizen-centric e-governance theories to develop a citizen-centric social governance framework. We apply the framework to a field-based case study of Japan's Kitakyushu smart community project to examine the validity and utility of the framework's antecedent conditions: resource-dependent leadership network, cross-sector collaboration based on social ties, and citizen-centric e-governance.

abstract = {The appeal of revolutionising urban governance through information technologies has prompted cities across the globe to pursue smart city initiatives. The mainstream scholarship on these initiatives has mostly focused on technology and corporate-led urban development, and it also often privileges the experience of cities in the global North. Nevertheless, this mainstream understanding of the smart city may obscure emerging new power dynamics and locally contextualised processes associated with smart urban development, especially in cities at the global periphery. Inspired by post-colonial theories, this article makes the case for ‘provincialising' smart urbanism by dislodging technology from the centre of analysis, accentuating perspectives of cities outside the locations where the smart city knowledge is traditionally produced and attending to power relationships. In our case study of Taipei, this provincialising approach helps unveil various logics, intentionalities, assemblages and power dynamics through which the smart city is employed as a political strategy to facilitate urban regime transition. We argue that the current non-affiliated Ko administration exploits the veneer of technological superiority and political neutrality of its smart city agenda to set a new growth agenda, form new development coalitions, establish new institutions and incorporate rising populist momentum into policy-making. Focusing on the politics of being smart, our findings illustrate how smart city experiments reshape power dynamics and regime formation through reorganising actors and interest groups, reconfiguring government institutions, reallocating resource distribution and, in the end, bolstering governing legitimacy.},

abstract = {This paper examines the neoliberal ideals that underpin participation and citizenship in the smart city and their replication mechanisms at the European level, particularly focusing on the work of the European Innovation Partnership for Smart Cities and Communities. The research consisted of three levels of data generation and analysis: a discourse analysis of policy documents and project descriptions of the 61 Commitments in the European Innovation Partnership for Smart Cities and Communities ‘citizen-focus' cluster; interviews with a dozen stakeholders working on citizen engagement in a small sample of European Innovation Partnership for Smart Cities and Communities flagship projects; and twenty interviews with city officers and corporate exhibitors at the 2017 Smart City Expo and World Congress. We contend that smart cities as currently conceived enact a blueprint of neoliberal urbanism and promote a form of neoliberal citizenship. Supra-national institutions like the European Innovation Partnership for Smart Cities and Communities act at a multi-scalar level, connecting diverse forms of neoliberal urbanism whilst promoting policy agendas and projects that perform neoliberal citizenship in the spaces of the everyday. Despite attempts to recast the smart city as ‘citizen-focused', smart urbanism remains rooted in pragmatic, instrumental and paternalistic discourses and practices rather than those of social rights, political citizenship, and the common good. In our view, if smart cities are to become truly ‘citizen-focused', an alternative conception of smart citizenship needs to be deployed, one that enables an effective shift of power and is rooted in the right to the city, entitlements, community, participation, commons, and ideals beyond the market.},

However, what ‘citizen-centric' means in practice is rarely articulated. We draw on and extend Sherry Arnstein's seminal work on participation in planning and renewal programmes to create the ‘Scaffold of Smart Citizen Participation'—a conceptual tool to unpack the diverse ways in which the smart city frames citizens. We use this scaffold to measure smart citizen inclusion, participation, and empowerment in smart city initiatives in Dublin, Ireland. Our analysis illustrates how most ‘citizen-centric' smart city initiatives are rooted in stewardship, civic paternalism, and a neoliberal conception of citizenship that prioritizes consumption choice and individual autonomy within a framework of state and corporate defined constraints that prioritize market-led solutions to urban issues, rather than being grounded in civil, social and political rights and the common good. We conclude that significant normative work is required to rethink ‘smart citizens' and ‘smart citizenship' and to remake smart cities if they are to truly become ‘citizen-centric'.},

@article{Capdevila2015b,
abstract = {Purpose – In recent years, the term “smart city” has attracted a lot of attention from policy makers, business leaders and citizenship in general. Although there is not a unique definition of what a smart city is, it is generally accepted that “smart” urban policies refer to local governments' initiatives that use information and communication technologies in order to increase the quality of life of their inhabitants while contributing to a sustainable development. So far, “smart city” approaches have generally been related to top-down processes of technology diffusion. The purpose of this paper is to present a broader view on “smart” initiatives to analyze both top-down and bottom-up dynamics in a smart city. The authors argue that these two perspectives are complementary and its combination can reinforce the collaboration between different city stakeholders. Top-down and bottom-up initiatives are not opposed forces but, on the contrary, can have a synergistic effect on the innovation capacity of the city. Both perspectives are illustrated by providing examples of different “smart” aspects in the city of Barcelona: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. Design/methodology/approach – To illustrate the arguments, the authors analyze the case of the city of Barcelona providing examples of top-down and bottom-up initiatives in four different smart city aspects: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. The research method is based on a case study (Yin, 1984). The primary data consisted on interviews to city council representatives as well as managers of local public institutions, like economic development offices, and local organizations like for instance coworking spaces. The authors interviewed also specialists on the innovation history of the city in order to validate the data. In addition, the authors used secondary data such as reports on the 22@, and documentation on the Barcelona innovation policies, as well as doing a compilation of press articles and the online content of the institutional webpages. All together, the authors have followed a data triangulation strategy to seek data validation based on the cross-verification of the analyzed data sources. Findings – The analysis suggests that the top-down and bottom-up perspectives are complementary and their combination can reinforce the collaboration between different city stakeholders. Top-down and bottom-up initiatives are not opposed forces but, on the contrary, can have a synergistic effect on the innovation capacity of the city. Both perspectives are illustrated by providing examples of different “smart” aspects in the city of Barcelona: smart districts, open collaborative spaces, infrastructures and open data. Research limitations/implications – Nevertheless, the analysis has its limitations. Even if the authors have emphasized the importance of the bottom-up initiatives, citizens do not have often the resources to act without governmental intervention. This is the case of services that require high-cost infrastructures or regulatory changes. Also, as it usually happens in the case of disruptive technology, it is hard for citizens to understand the possibilities of its use. In these cases, firms and institutions must play an important role in the first phases of the diffusion of innovations, by informing and incentivizing its use. It is also important to note that some of the emerging usages of technology are confronted to legal or regulatory issues. For instance, distributed and shared Wi-Fi networks might be in opposition to economic interests of internet providers, that often difficult its expansion. It is also the case of services of the sharing economy that represent a menace to established institutions (like the tensions between Uber and taxi companies, or Airbnb and hotels). In these cases, city halls like it is the case in Barcelona, tend to respond to these emergent uses of technology by regulating to ensure protection to existing corporate services. Practical implications – In conclusion, the transformational process that leads a city to become a smart city has to take in consideration the complexity and the plurality of the urban reality. Beyond considering citizens as being users, testers or consumers of technology, local administrations that are able to identify, nourish and integrate the emerging citizens' initiatives would contribute to the reinforcement of a smart city reality. Originality/value – The contribution of the paper is to go beyond the generalized technologic discourse around smart cities by adding the layer of the citizens' initiatives.},

@article{Burns2023,
abstract = {The critical research agenda on smart cities has tended to assume a largely top-down orientation in which powerful actors like the state and corporations enact programmes to embed Information & Communication Technologies (ICT) in the urban landscape. Because of the way research has framed this relation of power, the dominant response has been to seek social justice by either contesting these top-down exercises of (digital) power or by reconceptualising the smart city ‘from below'. In this paper, we join a growing chorus of voices recognising the importance of interstitial actors that influence the ways in which the smart city manifests. We draw on a five-year ongoing study in Calgary, Alberta, to examine two actor groups that are, properly, neither top-down nor bottom-up, but play an important role in envisioning, implementing and contesting how ‘smartness' is framed. The first set of actors, situated between the top and bottom of the smart city hierarchy, are most prominently community associations, non-profit organisations and ad-hoc task groups. The second group is comprised of groups with different digital practices, whose spectre of marginalisation influences how digital systems are articulated and pursued. These actors strategically move between different interstices in order to enact particular kinds of political influence, and often influence smart cities by virtue of their absence, profoundly impacting urban political geographies of smartness.},

This urban industrial configuration no longer fits with the value creation principles of the new techno-economic paradigm. In order to overcome this crisis, cities of the future must find suitable trajectories and become smart cities. However, there is no consensus about what really makes a city smarter. What are the elements that a smart city must have in order to offer high quality of life and a prosperous environment for creativity and innovation? This paper aims at disclosing the driving elements that make a city smarter, based on the literature, interviews with experts, and insights from smart cities projects (Amsterdam, Barcelona, Lisbon, Vienna). Results show that a smart city is an urban innovation ecosystem where knowledge easily flows from a deliberated interaction and collaboration among different stakeholders to create wealth, supported by a flexible institutional structure, an integrated-participative governance model, a digital-green infrastructure and a functional urban design with diversified amenities and facilities. We conclude that cities, to become smarter, should upgrade the elements related to their different dimensions, which are the techno-economic activity, the environ-urban configuration and the socio-institutional structures in an integrated manner, guided by an integrated and comprehensive governance model.},

While there appears to be universal agreement that the involvement of citizens in the decision making process of government is a good idea, there is little agreement as to the best way to achieve meaningful involvement. There are many ways to consult with the public and get a sense of what they see as problems and opportunities; it is quite another thing to actively engage citizens in the decision-making process. This paper explores the challenges and dilemmas associated with direct citizen participation, reflects on the various models of citizen-government interactions and makes recommendations for moving beyond conventional participation.

abstract = {This paper presents lessons learnt through empirical research work developed in three metropolitan cities in South Italy aimed at exploring if and how the "Smart" framework might improve urban planning in cities with lacks in planning processes. Authors argue that organized networks of citizens (such as non-profit organizations or private associations) together with networks of institutions (such as partnerships amongst municipalities or universities) are needed in order to improve the smartness of a city; technologies are framed as opportunities and supports for more inclusive and informed decision-making processes, i.e. as a tool, rather than as a goal, for effective smartness. The paper discusses the primary findings of a Research Project conducted at the Department of Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering (DICEA), University of Naples, titled "Smart Energy Master for the Energy Management of Territory" funded by EU.The methodology is based on the case-study method, whose sources of evidence are: quantitative indicators, archival documents, and excerpts from interviews with key stakeholders. In detail, the paper focuses on three Southern Italian cities (Reggio Calabria, Catania and Palermo), which have been clustered for similar challenges they have to face, in relation to their geographical proximity and cultural features. Findings show the twofold use of technologies for cities: on the one hand, technology may be perceived as a panacea and Smart initiatives may be isolated and episodic experiments; on the other, technologies may be critically incorporated in complex policies and initiatives aimed at regenerating urban areas holistically, and Smart initiatives may be coordinated and well-connected experiences. Authors argue that the second cases are feasible approaches for improving urban planning in challenging South-European contexts.},

The paper uses a mixed method approach to develop case studies of the governance models employed. The analysis shows that both cities work along the three dimensions (economic, technological and human) of the sharing paradigm to create a sharing city, with slightly different governance approaches, but both lack institutionalized mechanisms of collaboration. Nevertheless, both are pioneering examples of engagement with the sharing economy.

Owing to the rapid expansion of political activities in the last decades this question has become increasingly difficult to answer. Neither the development of all-embracing nominal definitions, nor deductive analyses of existing modes of participation seem to be helpful. In addition, the spread of expressive modes of participation makes it hard to avoid purely subjective definitions. The aim of this discussion paper is to develop an operational definition of political participation, which allows us to cover distinct conceptualizations systematically, efficiently and consistently. This goal can only be arrived at if the conventional approach of presenting nominal definitions to solve conceptual problems is left behind. Instead, available definitions are included in a set of decision rules to distinguish three main variants of political participation. A fourth variant is distinguished for non-political activities used for political purposes. Together, the four variants of political participation cover the whole range of political participation systematically without excluding any mode of political participation unknown yet. At the same time, the endless expansion of the modes of political participation in modern democracies does not result in an endless conceptual expansion.

Empirical verification was performed using the ordinary least squares method with sample data from 182 countries. The results show that global e-participation positively affects voice and accountability in three channels: e-information, e-consultation, and e-decision. Moreover, the effects of e-participation on voice and accountability are more pronounced in least developed countries than in developing and developed countries.

With the aid of an in-depth literature review, this study explores e-participation initiatives and their progress in strengthening the governance of South African municipalities. Using the content analysis technique, this study reveals that there is a serious lack of digital infrastructure and that digital gaps and lack of proper research addressing these problems between urban and rural municipalities contribute to inadequate Information and Communication Technology (ICT) strategies to improve citizen engagement and participation in governance processes. From this perspective, this study recommends an urgent need to undertake deliberate awareness campaigns to promote the use of e-participation platforms; and identify the citizens' needs and concerns to formulate locally preferred content and design inclusive policies to strengthen the order of local governance.},

We analyse the multi-level governance of these transitions for three regional case studies: Shanghai, Wuhan and Hangzhou. We find that regions both adopt and adjust green and digital aims and means differently from national policy. A twin transition is not comprehensively addressed at the national level, but is partially implemented in the three regions. Based on our findings, we develop a regional typology sketching top-down policy implementation strategies.},

abstract = {Rapid urban growth around the globe has created major waste management challenges, particularly in locations that have experienced rapid urban expansion, such as Oman. In the following study, Al-Duqm as Oman's primary economic zone is investigated, where outdated waste management practices are at odds with the national Sustainable Development Goals. In order to address this problem, we present a system that includes the use of Internet of Things sensors, combined with GPS tracking features and artificial intelligence capabilities. With this waste collection system, we aim to achieve enhanced speed and cost effectiveness and environmental sustainability. Ultrasonic sensors with AI-based route planning installed in waste bins enable the system to minimize unnecessary waste collection rounds by trucks. Laboratory evaluations of our system demonstrated a 28% reduction in fuel consumption and a 15% decrease in operational expenses, achieving collection performance levels that improved by more than 41.5%. The unique quality of this approach consists of aligning multifaceted technologies to fulfill Al-Duqm's special requirements for its dry climate and expanding infrastructure. The combination of sensor-generated data enables trucks to navigate empty container spaces, thus saving time and lowering emission levels. The findings of this study aid Oman in reaching its 2040 targets, in addition to Global Sustainable Development Goal 11, while simultaneously enhancing environmentally friendly initiatives in urban areas. The results of this study demonstrate how modern smart systems transform expensive waste management services into an intelligent environmental tool, thus providing examples for other areas that seek to achieve sustainable development through urban growth.},

The purpose of our study was to examine and qualitatively determine the design and content elements of health apps that facilitate or impede usage from the users' perceptive. Methods: In 2014, six focus groups and five individual interviews were conducted in the Midwest region of the U.S. with a mixture of 44 smartphone owners of various social economic status. The participants were asked about their general and health specific mobile app usage. They were then shown specific features of exemplar health apps and prompted to discuss their perceptions. The focus groups and interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded using the software NVivo. Results: Inductive thematic analysis was adopted to analyze the data and nine themes were identified: 1) barriers to adoption of health apps, 2) barriers to continued use of health apps, 3) motivators, 4) information and personalized guidance, 5) tracking for awareness and progress, 6) credibility, 7) goal setting, 8) reminders, and 9) sharing personal information. The themes were mapped to theories for interpretation of the results. Conclusions: This qualitative research with a diverse pool of participants extended previous research on challenges and opportunities of health apps.

abstract = {Background Recently, mobile health technology has emerged as a promising avenue for improving physician-patient communication and patient outcomes. The objective of our study was to determine the public's perception of barriers and benefits to using mobile health technology technologies to enhance recovery after operation. Methods We used the Empire State Poll to ask 2 open-ended questions to 800 participants assessing their perceptions of benefits and barriers to use mobile health technology after operation. All responses were coded independently, and any discrepancies were resolved by consensus. We used grounded theory to allow themes to arise from the codes. Interrater reliability was calculated using Cohen's Kappa. Results Participants identified a range of possible barriers to using mobile health technology apps after operation including: protecting personal health information, technology effectiveness and failure, preference for face-to-face interaction with their surgeon, level of effort required, and ability of the older adults to navigate mobile health technology. Participants identified multiple possible benefits including: better monitoring, improved communication with their surgeon, minimizing follow-up visits, improved convenience, and increased patient knowledge. In the study, 15% of all respondents stated there were no barriers whereas 6% stated there were no benefits. Conclusion Participants were receptive to the many potential benefits of this technology to enhance not only their relationships with providers and the convenience of access, but also their health outcomes. We must address participants concerns about data security and their fears of losing a personal relationship with their doctor.},

abstract = {Background: Falls represent a significant threat to the health and independence of adults aged 65 years and older. As a wide variety and large number of passive monitoring systems are currently and increasingly available to detect when individuals have fallen, there is a need to analyze and synthesize the evidence regarding their ability to accurately detect falls to determine which systems are most effective. Objectives: The purpose of this literature review is to systematically assess the current state of design and implementation of fall-detection devices. This review also examines to what extent these devices have been tested in the real world as well as the acceptability of these devices to older adults. Data Sources: A systematic literature review was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycINFO from their respective inception dates to June 25, 2013. Study Eligibility Criteria and Interventions: Articles were included if they discussed a project or multiple projects involving a system with the purpose of detecting a fall in adults. It was not a requirement for inclusion in this review that the system targets persons older than 65 years. Articles were excluded if they were not written in English or if they looked at fall risk, fall detection in children, fall prevention, or a personal emergency response device. Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods: Studies were initially divided into those using sensitivity, specificity, or accuracy in their evaluation methods and those using other methods to evaluate their devices. Studies were further classified into wearable devices and nonwearable devices. Studies were appraised for inclusion of older adults in sample and if evaluation included real-world settings. Results: This review identified 57 projects that used wearable systems and 35 projects using nonwearable systems, regardless of evaluation technique. Nonwearable systems included cameras, motion sensors, microphones, and fl oor sensors. Of the projects examining wearable systems, only 7.1% reported monitoring older adults in a real-world setting. There were no studies of nonwearable devices that used older adults as subjects in either a laboratory or a real-world setting. In general, older adults appear to be interested in using such devices although they express concerns over privacy and understanding exactly what the device is doing at specific times. Limitations: This systematic review was limited to articles written in English and did not include gray literature. Manual paper screening and review processes may have been subject to interpretive bias. Conclusions and Implications of Key Findings: There exists a large body of work describing various fall-detection devices. The challenge in this area is to create highly accurate unobtrusive devices. From this review it appears that the technology is becoming more able to accomplish such a task. There is a need now for more real-world tests as well as standardization of the evaluation of these devices.},

However, there are significant challenges in converting this large-scale sensing data into decisions for real-world applications. Motivated by applications like health monitoring and intervention and home automation we consider a novel problem called Activity Prediction, where the goal is to predict future activity occurrence times from sensor data. In this paper, we make three main contributions. First, we formulate and solve the activity prediction problem in the framework of imitation learning and reduce it to a simple regression learning problem. This approach allows us to leverage powerful regression learners that can reason about the relational structure of the problem with negligible computational overhead. Second, we present several metrics to evaluate activity predictors in the context of real-world applications. Third, we evaluate our approach using real sensor data collected from 24 smart home testbeds. We also embed the learned predictor into a mobile-device-based activity prompter and evaluate the app for nine participants living in smart homes. Our results indicate that our activity predictor performs better than the baseline methods, and offers a simple approach for predicting activities from sensor data.},

abstract = {Many real-world applications that focus on addressing needs of a human, require information about the activities being performed by the human in real-time. While advances in pervasive computing have led to the development of wireless and non-intrusive sensors that can capture the necessary activity information, current activity recognition approaches have so far experimented on either a scripted or pre-segmented sequence of sensor events related to activities. In this paper we propose and evaluate a sliding window based approach to perform activity recognition in an on line or streaming fashion; recognizing activities as and when new sensor events are recorded. To account for the fact that different activities can be best characterized by different window lengths of sensor events, we incorporate the time decay and mutual information based weighting of sensor events within a window. Additional contextual information in the form of the previous activity and the activity of the previous window is also appended to the feature describing a sensor window. The experiments conducted to evaluate these techniques on real-world smart home datasets suggests that combining mutual information based weighting of sensor events and adding past contextual information to the feature leads to best performance for streaming activity recognition. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Introduction Increasing social interaction could be a promising intervention for improving cognitive function. We examined the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation through personal computers, webcams, and a user-friendly interactive Internet interface had high adherence and a positive effect on cognitive function among older adults without dementia. Methods Daily 30-minute face-to-face communications were conducted during a 6-week trial period in the intervention group. The control group received only a weekly telephone interview. The cognitive status of normal subjects and those with mild cognitive impairment was operationally defined as a global clinical dementia rating of 0 and 0.5, respectively. Age, sex, education, mini mental state examination score, and clinical dementia rating score were balancing factors in randomization. The subjects were recruited using mass-mailing invitations. The pre- to postintervention differences in the cognitive test scores and loneliness scores were compared between the control and intervention groups using linear regression models. Results Eighty-three subjects participated (41 in the intervention group and 42 in the control group). Their mean ± standard deviation age was 80.5 ± 6.8 years. Adherence to the protocol was high. There was no dropout and mean percentage of days completed of the targeted trial days among the intervention group was 89% (range 77%-100%). Among the cognitively intact participants, the intervention group improved more than did the control group on a semantic fluency test (P =.003) at the post-trial assessment and a phonemic fluency test (P =.004) at the 18-week assessments. Among those with mild cognitive impairment, a trend (P =.04) toward improved psychomotor speed was observed in the intervention group. Conclusion Daily conversations by way of user-friendly Internet communication programs demonstrated high adherence. Among the cognitively intact, the intervention group showed greater improvement in tests of language-based executive functions. Increasing daily social contacts through communication technologies could offer cost-effective home-based prevention methods. Additional studies with a longer follow-up duration are required to examine whether the intervention slows cognitive declines and delays the onset of dementia.},

Thirty-three articles focused on family caregivers of adult and older patients, while 32 articles focused on parental caregivers of paediatric patients. The technologies included video, web-based, telephone-based and telemetry/remote monitoring. Six main categories of interventions were delivered via technology: education, consultation (including decision support), psychosocial/cognitive behavioural therapy (including problem solving training), social support, data collection and monitoring, and clinical care delivery. More than 95% of the studies reported significant improvements in the caregivers' outcomes and that caregivers were satisfied and comfortable with telehealth. The review showed that telehealth can positively affect chronic disease care, home and hospice care.},

abstract = {Objectives: Loneliness and social isolation are two important health outcomes among older adults. Current assessment of these outcomes relies on self-report which is susceptible to bias. This paper reports on the relationship between loneliness and objective measures of isolation using a phone monitoring device. Method: Phone monitors were installed in the homes of 26 independent elderly individuals from the ORCATECH Life Laboratory cohort (age 86 ± 4.5, 88% female) and used to monitor the daily phone usage for an average of 174 days. Loneliness was assessed using the 20-item University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness scale. A mixed effects negative binomial regression was used to model the relationship between loneliness and social isolation, as assessed using the total number of calls, controlling for cognitive function, pain, age, gender, and weekday. A secondary analysis examined the differential effect of loneliness on incoming and outgoing calls. Results: The average UCLA Loneliness score was 35.3 ± 7.6, and the median daily number of calls was 4. Loneliness was negatively associated with telephone use (IRR = 0.99, p < 0.05). Daily phone use was also associated with gender (IRR = 2.03, p < 0.001) and cognitive status (IRR = 1.51, p < 0.001). The secondary analysis revealed that loneliness was significantly related to incoming (IRR = 0.98, p < 0.01) but not outgoing calls. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the close relationship between loneliness and social isolation, showing that phone behaviour is associated with emotional state and cognitive function. Because phone behaviour can be monitored unobtrusively, it may be possible to sense loneliness levels in older adults using objective assessments of key aspects of behaviour.},

The importance of having robust, intelligent geospatial analytics systems in place to process and make sense of such data in real time cannot therefore be overestimated. The authors argue that IoT-powered smart cities stand better chances of becoming healthier cities.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The goal of this research is to use smart home technology to assist people who are recovering from injuries or coping with disabilities to live independently. OBJECTIVE:We introduce an algorithm to model and forecast wake and sleep behaviors that are exhibited by the participant. Furthermore, we propose that sleep behavior is impacted by and can be modeled from wake behavior, and vice versa. METHODS: This paper describes the Behavior Forecasting (BF) algorithm. BF consists of 1) defining numeric values that reflect sleep and wake behavior, 2) forecasting wake and sleep values from past behavior, 3) analyzing the effect of wake behavior on sleep and vice versa, and 4) improving prediction performance by using both wake and sleep scores. RESULTS: The BF method was evaluated with data collected from 20 smart homes. We found that regardless of the forecasting method utilized, wake behavior and sleep behavior can be modeled with a minimum accuracy of 84%. Additionally, normalizing the wake and sleep scores drastically improves the accuracy to 99%. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that we can effectively model wake and sleep behaviors in a smart environment. Furthermore, wake behaviors can be predicted from sleep behaviors and vice versa.},

abstract = {With the rising age of the population, there is increased need to help elderly maintain their independence. Smart homes, employing passive sensor networks and pervasive computing techniques, enable the unobtrusive assessment of activities and behaviors of the elderly which can be useful for health state assessment and intervention. Due to the multiple health benefits associated with socializing, accurately tracking whether an individual has visitors to their home is one of the more important aspects of elders' behaviors that could be assessed with smart home technology. With this goal, we have developed a preliminary SVM model to identify periods where untagged visitors are present in the home. Using the dwell time, number of sensor firings, and number of transitions between major living spaces (living room, dining room, kitchen and bathroom) as features in the model, and self report from two subjects as ground truth, we were able to accurately detect the presence of visitors in the home with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.90 and 0.89 for subject 1, and of 0.67 and 0.78 for subject 2, respectively. These preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of detecting visitors with in-home sensor data, but highlight the need for more advanced modeling techniques so the model performs well for all subjects and all types of visitors. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

However, tools like cognitive testing are time consuming and require costly expertise. Changes in activities of daily living such as medication adherence may herald the onset of cognitive decline before clinical standards. Here, we determine the relationship between medication adherence and cognitive function in preclinical older adults. We objectively assessed medication adherence in 38 older adults (mean age 86.7 ± 6.9 years). Our results demonstrate that individuals with lower cognitive function have more spread in the timing of taking their medications (P = .014) and increase the spread in the timing of taking their medications over time (P = .012). These results demonstrate that continuous monitoring of medication adherence may provide the opportunity to identify patients experiencing slow cognitive decline in the earliest stages when pharmacologic or behavioral interventions may be most effective.},

abstract = {Background: Difficulty turning is a major contributor to mobility disability, falls, and reduced quality of life in older people because it requires dynamic balance control that worsens with age. However, no study has quantified the quality and quantity of turning during normal daily activities in older people. The objective of this pilot study was to determine if quality of turning during daily activities is associated with falls and/or cognitive function. Methods: Thirty-five elderly participants (85 ± 8 years) wore three Opal inertial sensors. Turning and activity rate were measured. Based on retrospective falls, participants were grouped into nonfallers (N = 16), single fallers (N = 12), and recurrent fallers (N = 7). We also determined which turning characteristic predicted falls in the 6 months following the week of monitoring. Results: Quality of turning was significantly compromised in recurrent fallers compared with nonfallers (p <. 05). In contrast, activity rate and mean number of turns per hour were similar across the three groups. Also, quality of turning during a prescribed test was similar across the three groups. Visuospatial and memory functions and the Tinetti Balance Scores were associated with quality of turning. Future falls were related to an increased variability of number of steps to turn. Conclusions: Continuous monitoring of turning characteristics, while walking during daily activities, is feasible in older people. Turning characteristics during daily life appear to be more sensitive to fall risk than prescribed turning tasks. These findings suggest a slower, less variable, cautious turning strategy in elderly volunteers with a history of falls.},

In an exploratory study, we examined whether patterns of computer mouse movements obtained from routine home computer use discriminated between older adults with and without MCI. Methods: Participants were 42 cognitively intact and 20 older adults with MCI enrolled in a longitudinal study of in-home monitoring technologies. Mouse pointer movement variables were computed during one week of routine home computer use using algorithms that identified and characterized mouse movements within each computer use session. Results: MCI was associated with making significantly fewer total mouse moves (P < .01) and making mouse movements that were more variable, less efficient, and with longer pauses between movements (P < .05). Mouse movement measures were significantly associated with several cognitive domains (P values <.01-.05). Discussion: Remotely monitored computer mouse movement patterns are a potential early marker of real-world cognitive changes in MCI.},

abstract = {Objective: To determine whether unobtrusive long-term in-home assessment of walking speed and its variability can distinguish those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from those with intact cognition. Methods: Walking speed was assessed using passive infrared sensors fixed in series on the ceiling of the homes of elderly individuals participating in the Intelligent Systems for Assessing Aging Change (ISAAC) cohort study. Latent trajectory models were used to analyze weekly mean speed and walking speed variability (coefficient of variation [COV]). Results: ISAAC participants living alone included 54 participants with intact cognition, 31 participants with nonamnestic MCI (naMCI), and 8 participants with amnestic MCI at baseline, with a mean follow-up of 2.6 ± 1.0 years. Trajectory models identified 3 distinct trajectories (fast, moderate, and slow) of mean weekly walking speed. Participants with naMCI were more likely to be in the slow speed group than in the fast (p = 0.01) or moderate (p = 0.04) speed groups. For COV, 4 distinct trajectories were identified: group 1, the highest baseline and increasing COV followed by a sharply declining COV; groups 2 and 3, relatively stable COV; and group 4, the lowest baseline and decreasing COV. Participants with naMCI were more likely to be members of either highest or lowest baseline COV groups (groups 1 or 4), possibly representing the trajectory of walking speed variability for early- and late-stage MCI, respectively. Conclusion: Walking speed and its daily variability may be an early marker of the development of MCI. These and other real-time measures of function may offer novel ways of detecting transition phases leading to dementia. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2012 by AAN Enterprises, Inc.},

abstract = {Evidence documents associations between neighborhood design and active and sedentary forms of travel. Most studies compare travel patterns for people located in different types of neighborhoods at one point in time adjusting for demographics. Most fail to account for either underlying neighborhood selection factors (reasons for choosing a neighborhood) or preferences (neighborhoods that are preferred) that impact neighborhood selection and behavior. Known as self-selection, this issue makes it difficult to evaluate causation among built form, behavior, and associated outcomes and to know how much more walking and less driving could occur through creating environments conducive to active transport. The current study controls for neighborhood selection and preference and isolates the effect of the built environment on walking, car use, and obesity. Separate analyses were conducted among 2056 persons in the Atlanta, USA based Strategies for Metropolitan Atlanta's Regional Transportation and Air Quality (SMARTRAQ) travel survey on selection factors and 1466 persons in the SMARTRAQ community preference sub-survey. A significant proportion of the population are "mismatched" and do not live in their preferred neighborhood type. Factors influencing neighborhood selection and individual preferences, and current neighborhood walkability explained vehicle travel distance after controlling for demographic variables. Individuals who preferred and lived in a walkable neighborhood walked most (33.9% walked) and drove 25.8 miles per day on average. Individuals that preferred and lived in car dependent neighborhoods drove the most (43 miles per day) and walked the least (3.3%). Individuals that do not prefer a walkable environment walked little and show no change in obesity prevalence regardless of where they live. About half as many participants were obese (11.7%) who prefer and live in walkable environments than participants who prefer car dependent environments (21.6%). Findings suggest that creating walkable environments may result in higher levels of physical activity and less driving and in slightly lower obesity prevalence for those preferring walkability. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {To date, nearly all research on physical activity and the built environment is based on self-reported physical activity and perceived assessment of the built environment. To assess how objectively measured levels of physical activity are related with objectively measured aspects of the physical environment around each participant's home while controlling for sociodemographic covariates. Objective measures of the built environment unique to each household's physical location were developed within a geographic information system to assess land-use mix, residential density, and street connectivity. These measures were then combined into a walkability index. Accelerometers were deployed over a 2-day period to capture objective levels of physical activity in 357 adults. Measures of land-use mix, residential density, and intersection density were positively related with number of minutes of moderate physical activity per day. A combined walkability index of these urban form factors was significant (p=0.002) and explained additional variation in the number of minutes of moderate activity per day over sociodemographic covariates. Thirty-seven percent of individuals in the highest walkability index quartile met the ≥30 minutes of physical activity recommended, compared to only 18% of individuals in the lowest walkability quartile. Individuals in the highest walkability quartile were 2.4 times more likely (confidence interval=1.18-4.88) than individuals in the lowest walkability quartile to meet the recommended ≥30 minutes of moderate physical activity per day. This research supports the hypothesis that community design is significantly associated with moderate levels of physical activity. These results support the rationale for the development of policy that promotes increased levels of land-use mix, street connectivity, and residential density as interventions that can have lasting public health benefits. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Journal of Preventive Medicine.},

abstract = {Objectives. To assess the impact of neighborhood walkability on body mass index (BMI) trajectories of urban Canadians. Methods. Data are from Canada's National Population Health Survey (n = 2935; biannual assessments 1994-2006). We measured walkability with the Walk Score. We modeled body mass index (BMI, defined as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters [kg/m2]) trajectories as a function of Walk Score and sociodemographic and behavioral covariates with growth curve models and fixed-effects regression models. Results. In men, BMI increased annually by an average of 0.13 kg/m2 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.11, 0.14) over the 12 years of follow-up. Moving to a high-walkable neighborhood (2 or more Walk Score quartiles higher) decreased BMI trajectories for men by approximately 1 kg/m2 (95% CI = -1.16, -0.17). Moving to a low-walkable neighborhood increased BMI for men by approximately 0.45 kg/m2 (95% CI = 0.01, 0.89). There was no detectable influence of neighborhood walkability on body weight for women. Conclusions. Our study of a large sample of urban Canadians followed for 12 years confirms that neighborhood walkability influences BMI trajectories for men, and may be influential in curtailing male age-related weight gain.},

abstract = {Seasonal influenza epidemics are a major public health concern, causing tens of millions of respiratory illnesses and 250,000 to 500,000 deaths worldwide each year. In addition to seasonal influenza, a new strain of influenza virus against which no previous immunity exists and that demonstrates human-to-human transmission could result in a pandemic with millions of fatalities. Early detection of disease activity, when followed by a rapid response, can reduce the impact of both seasonal and pandemic influenza. One way to improve early detection is to monitor health-seeking behaviour in the form of queries to online search engines, which are submitted by millions of users around the world each day. Here we present a method of analysing large numbers of Google search queries to track influenza-like illness in a population. Because the relative frequency of certain queries is highly correlated with the percentage of physician visits in which a patient presents with influenza-like symptoms, we can accurately estimate the current level of weekly influenza activity in each region of the United States, with a reporting lag of about one day. This approach may make it possible to use search queries to detect influenza epidemics in areas with a large population of web search users. {\textcopyright}2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Background: In the United States, over 15 million informal caregivers provide unpaid care to people with Alzheimer disease (AD). Compared with others in their age group, AD caregivers have higher rates of stress, and medical and psychiatric illnesses. Psychosocial interventions improve the health of caregivers. However, constraints of time, distance, and availability inhibit the use of these services. Newer online technologies, such as social media, online groups, friendsourcing, and crowdsourcing, present alternative methods of delivering support. However, limited work has been done in this area with caregivers. Objective: The primary aims of this study were to determine (1) the feasibility of innovating peer support group work delivered through social media with friendsourcing, (2) whether the intervention provides an acceptable method for AD caregivers to obtain support, and (3) whether caregiver outcomes were affected by the intervention. A Facebook app provided support to AD caregivers through collecting friendsourced answers to caregiver questions from participants' social networks. The study's secondary aim was to descriptively compare friendsourced answers versus crowdsourced answers. Methods: We recruited AD caregivers online to participate in a 6-week-long asynchronous, online, closed group on Facebook, where caregivers received support through moderator prompts, group member interactions, and friendsourced answers to caregiver questions. We surveyed and interviewed participants before and after the online group to assess their needs, views on technology, and experience with the intervention. Caregiver questions were pushed automatically to the participants' Facebook News Feed, allowing participants' Facebook friends to see and post answers to the caregiver questions (Friendsourced answers). Of these caregiver questions, 2 were pushed to crowdsource workers through the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform. We descriptively compared characteristics of these crowdsourced answers with the friendsourced answers. Results: In total, 6 AD caregivers completed the initial online survey and semistructured telephone interview. Of these, 4 AD caregivers agreed to participate in the online Facebook closed group activity portion of the study. Friendsourcing and crowdsourcing answers to caregiver questions had similar rates of acceptability as rated by content experts: 90% (27/30) and 100% (45/45), respectively. Rates of emotional support and informational support for both groups of answers appeared to trend with the type of support emphasized in the caregiver question (emotional vs informational support question). Friendsourced answers included more shared experiences (20/30, 67%) than did crowdsourced answers (4/45, 9%). Conclusions: We found an asynchronous, online, closed group on Facebook to be generally acceptable as a means to deliver support to caregivers of people with AD. This pilot is too small to make judgments on effectiveness; however, results trended toward an improvement in caregivers' self-efficacy, sense of support, and perceived stress, but these results were not statistically significant. Both friendsourced and crowdsourced answers may be an acceptable way to provide informational and emotional support to caregivers of people with AD.},

abstract = {Objectives To test whether a multifaceted prospective memory intervention improved adherence to antihypertensive medications and to assess whether executive function and working memory processes moderated the intervention effects. Design Two-group longitudinal randomized control trial. Setting Community. Participants Individuals aged 65 and older without signs of dementia or symptoms of severe depression who were self-managing prescribed medication. Measurements After 4 weeks of initial adherence monitoring using a medication event monitoring system, individuals with 90% or less adherence were randomly assigned to groups. Intervention The prospective memory intervention was designed to provide strategies that switch older adults from relying on executive function and working memory processes (that show effects of cognitive aging) to mostly automatic associative processes (that are relatively spared with normal aging) for remembering to take medications. Strategies included establishing a routine, establishing cues strongly associated with medication taking actions, performing the action immediately upon thinking about it, using a medication organizer, and imagining medication taking to enhance encoding and improve cuing. Results There was significant improvement in adherence in the intervention group (57% at baseline to 78% after the intervention), but most of these gains were lost after 5 months. The control condition started at 68% and was stable during the intervention, but dropped to 62%. Executive function and working memory moderated the intervention effect, with the intervention producing greater benefit for those with lower executive function and working memory. Conclusion The intervention improved adherence, but the benefits were not sustained. Further research is needed to determine how to sustain the substantial initial benefits.},

@article{Naslund2016,
abstract = {Aims: People with serious mental illness are increasingly turning to popular social media, including Facebook, Twitter or YouTube, to share their illness experiences or seek advice from others with similar health conditions. This emerging form of unsolicited communication among self-forming online communities of patients and individuals with diverse health concerns is referred to as peer-To-peer support. We offer a perspective on how online peer-To-peer connections among people with serious mental illness could advance efforts to promote mental and physical wellbeing in this group. Methods: In this commentary, we take the perspective that when an individual with serious mental illness decides to connect with similar others online it represents a critical point in their illness experience. We propose a conceptual model to illustrate how online peer-To-peer connections may afford opportunities for individuals with serious mental illness to challenge stigma, increase consumer activation and access online interventions for mental and physical wellbeing. Results: People with serious mental illness report benefits from interacting with peers online from greater social connectedness, feelings of group belonging and by sharing personal stories and strategies for coping with day-To-day challenges of living with a mental illness. Within online communities, individuals with serious mental illness could challenge stigma through personal empowerment and providing hope. By learning from peers online, these individuals may gain insight about important health care decisions, which could promote mental health care seeking behaviours. These individuals could also access interventions for mental and physical wellbeing delivered through social media that could incorporate mutual support between peers, help promote treatment engagement and reach a wider demographic. Unforeseen risks may include exposure to misleading information, facing hostile or derogatory comments from others, or feeling more uncertain about one's health condition. However, given the evidence to date, the benefits of online peer-To-peer support appear to outweigh the potential risks. Conclusion: Future research must explore these opportunities to support and empower people with serious mental illness through online peer networks while carefully considering potential risks that may arise from online peer-To-peer interactions. Efforts will also need to address methodological challenges in the form of evaluating interventions delivered through social media and collecting objective mental and physical health outcome measures online. A key challenge will be to determine whether skills learned from peers in online networks translate into tangible and meaningful improvements in recovery, employment, or mental and physical wellbeing in the offline world.},

abstract = {Physical activity recognition using embedded sensors has enabled many context-aware applications in different areas, such as healthcare. Initially, one or more dedicated wearable sensors were used for such applications. However, recently, many researchers started using mobile phones for this purpose, since these ubiquitous devices are equipped with various sensors, ranging from accelerometers to magnetic field sensors. In most of the current studies, sensor data collected for activity recognition are analyzed offline using machine learning tools. However, there is now a trend towards implementing activity recognition systems on these devices in an online manner, since modern mobile phones have become more powerful in terms of available resources, such as CPU, memory and battery. The research on offline activity recognition has been reviewed in several earlier studies in detail. However, work done on online activity recognition is still in its infancy and is yet to be reviewed. In this paper, we review the studies done so far that implement activity recognition systems on mobile phones and use only their on-board sensors. We discuss various aspects of these studies. Moreover, we discuss their limitations and present various recommendations for future research.},

abstract = {Background: Physical activity tracking wearable devices have emerged as an increasingly popular method for consumers to assess their daily activity and calories expended. However, whether these wearable devices are valid at different levels of exercise intensity is unknown. Objective: The objective of this study was to examine heart rate (HR) and energy expenditure (EE) validity of 3 popular wrist-worn activity monitors at different exercise intensities. Methods: A total of 62 participants (females: 58%, 36/62; nonwhite: 47% [13/62 Hispanic, 8/62 Asian, 7/62 black/ African American, 1/62 other]) wore the Apple Watch, Fitbit Charge HR, and Garmin Forerunner 225. Validity was assessed using 2 criterion devices: HR chest strap and a metabolic cart. Participants completed a 10-minute seated baseline assessment; separate 4-minute stages of light-, moderate-, and vigorous-intensity treadmill exercises; and a 10-minute seated recovery period. Data from devices were compared with each criterion via two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance and Bland-Altman analysis. Differences are expressed in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Results: For the Apple Watch, HR MAPE was between 1.14% and 6.70%. HR was not significantly different at the start (P=.78), during baseline (P=.76), or vigorous intensity (P=.84); lower HR readings were measured during light intensity (P=.03), moderate intensity (P=.001), and recovery (P=.004). EE MAPE was between 14.07% and 210.84%. The device measured higher EE at all stages (P<.01). For the Fitbit device, the HR MAPE was between 2.38% and 16.99%. HR was not significantly different at the start (P=.67) or during moderate intensity (P=.34); lower HR readings were measured during baseline, vigorous intensity, and recovery (P<.001) and higher HR during light intensity (P<.001). EE MAPE was between 16.85% and 84.98%. The device measured higher EE at baseline (P=.003), light intensity (P<.001), and moderate intensity (P=.001). EE was not significantly different at vigorous (P=.70) or recovery (P=.10). For Garmin Forerunner 225, HR MAPE was between 7.87% and 24.38%. HR was not significantly different at vigorous intensity (P=.35). The device measured higher HR readings at start, baseline, light intensity, moderate intensity (P<.001), and recovery (P=.04). EE MAPE was between 30.77% and 155.05%. The device measured higher EE at all stages (P<.001). Conclusions: This study provides one of the first validation assessments for the Fitbit Charge HR, Apple Watch, and Garmin Forerunner 225. An advantage and novel approach of the study is the examination of HR and EE at specific physical activity intensities. Establishing validity of wearable devices is of particular interest as these devices are being used in weight loss interventions and could impact findings. Future research should investigate why differences between exercise intensities and the devices exist.},

abstract = {Purpose: An operational definition of dementia-related wandering is proposed to aid in clinical recognition, to promote research precision and validity, and to provide a pathway toward standardization of language in wandering science. Design and Methods: (1) One-hundred-and-eighty-three journal articles from multiple databases (Medline, OVID, CSA Journals, OCLC First Search, Google Scholar, PubMed, EBSCO) were reviewed to extract alternative terms and definitions for wandering or wandering-related behaviours; (2) terms and definitions were ordered alphabetically into a glossary; (3) a consensus approach was used to group glossary terms with related meanings into possible domains of wandering; (4) four domains (locomotion, drive, space and time) were found sufficient to encompass all wandering definitions; (5) wandering terms were placed into a conceptual map bounded by the four domain concepts and (6) a new provisional definition of wandering was formulated. Results: An empirically-based, operational definition improves clinical and research approaches to wandering and explicates historical inattention to certain beneficial aspects of the behaviour. Implications: Adoption of the proposed operational definition of wandering behaviour provides a platform upon which dementia care may be improved and standardized language may evolve in wandering science. {\textcopyright} 2007 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract = {The use of a fully implanted first-generation prototype sensor/telemetry system is described for long-term monitoring of subcutaneous tissue glucose in a small cohort of people with diabetes. Methods: Sensors are based on a membrane containing immobilized glucose oxidase and catalase coupled to oxygen electrodes and a telemetry system, integrated as an implant. The devices remained implanted for up to 180 days, with signals transmitted every 2 min to external receivers. Results: The data include signal recordings from glucose clamps and spontaneous glucose excursions, matched, respectively, to reference blood glucose and finger-stick values. The sensor signals indicate dynamic tissue glucose, for which there is no independent standard, and a model describing the relationship between blood glucose and the signal is, therefore, included. The values of all model parameters have been estimated, including the permeability of adjacent tissues to glucose, and equated to conventional mass transfer parameters. As a group, the sensor calibration varied randomly at an average rate of-2.6%/week. Statistical correlation indicated strong association between the sensor signals and reference glucose values. Conclusion: Continuous long-term glucose monitoring in individuals with diabetes is feasible with this system. Significance: All therapies for diabetes are based on glucose control, and therefore, require glucose monitoring. This fully implanted long-term sensor/telemetry system may facilitate a new era of management of the disease.},

In recent years, information and communication technologies improvements, along with mobile Internet, offering anywhere and anytime connectivity, play a key role on modern healthcare solutions. In this context, mobile health (m-Health) delivers healthcare services, overcoming geographical, temporal, and even organizational barriers. M-Health solutions address emerging problems on health services, including, the increasing number of chronic diseases related to lifestyle, high costs of existing national health services, the need to empower patients and families to self-care and handle their own healthcare, and the need to provide direct access to health services, regardless of time and place. Then, this paper presents a comprehensive review of the state of the art on m-Health services and applications. It surveys the most significant research work and presents a deep analysis of the top and novel m-Health services and applications proposed by industry. A discussion considering the European Union and United States approaches addressing the m-Health paradigm and directives already published is also considered. Open and challenging issues on emerging m-Health solutions are proposed for further works.},

Administrative, payroll, and billing data were collected for 26 primary care practices in a fee-for-service network that rolled out an HER on a staggered schedule from June 2006 through December 2008. Study Design. An interrupted time series design was used. Staffing, visit intensity, productivity, volume, practice expense, payments received, and net income data were collected monthly for 2004-2009. Changes were evaluated 1-6, 7-12, and >12 months postimplementation. Data Collection/Extraction Methods. Data were accessed through a SQLserver database, transformed into SAS{\textregistered}, and aggregated by practice. Practice-level data were divided by full-time physician equivalents for comparisons across practices by month. Principal Findings. Staffing and practice expenses increased following EHR implementation (3 and 6 percent after 12 months). Productivity, volume, and net income decreased initially but recovered to/close to preimplementation levels after 12 months. Visit intensity did not change significantly, and a secular trend offset the decrease in payments received. Conclusions. Expenses increased and productivity decreased following EHR implementation, but not as much or as persistently as might be expected. Longer term effects still need to be examined. {\textcopyright} 2014 Health Research and Educational Trust.},

It specifically investigates the effect of in-service training on civil servants' digital literacy, the consequent impact of e-governance implementation, and service delivery. The study finds that there was inadequate in-service training, which was partly caused by the cognitive disposition of civil servants who did not fully cooperate with the implementation of the e-governance reform. The study aligns with existing theories of institutional and organisational change which requires that organisational change requires realignment of beliefs and behavioral norms of organization members. The study recommends that the implementation of e-governance can only yield better results in effective service delivery if the civil servants are made to accept the reform and their digital literacy levels are significantly enhanced through appropriate in-service training.},

In Finland, libraries provide both traditional library services and digital support to help customers access their personal bank accounts and health records. However, the impact these new support demands on librarians' expertise and work remains understudied. To address this gap, we interviewed 21 librarians, exploring their experiences in providing digital access services. Qualitative thematic analysis of the transcripts revealed four situational dimensions of digital care work, which encompasses ethical and emotional aspects. We also recommend some best practices for digital access services.},

This article presents an expanded theory of change to explain how digital technology could augment pathways to women's empowerment in self-help groups (SHGs), developed through an application of social capital theories to two existing theories of change. Drawing on the analysis of secondary data, it discusses SHGs in India, the determinants of mobile phone use among women in India, particularly patriarchal gender norms, and select theories of change for women's empowerment in SHGs. The proposed enhanced theory of change has the potential to assist implementers, policymakers, researchers and SHGs themselves to more effectively leverage the empowering potential of digital technology to improve the economic and social opportunities for women in the context of global development strategies.},

abstract = {Background: In a rapidly digitalizing world, the inability of older adults to leverage digital technology has been associated with weaker social connections and poorer health outcomes. Despite the widespread digital adoption in Singapore, older adults, especially those of lower socioeconomic status (SES), still face difficulties in adopting information and communications technology and are typically digitally excluded. Objective: We aimed to examine the impact of the volunteer-led, one-on-one, and home-based digital literacy program on digital literacy and health-related outcomes such as self-reported loneliness, social connectedness, quality of life, and well-being for older adults of low SES. Methods: A nonrandomized controlled study was carried out in Singapore between July 2020 and November 2021 involving 138 digitally excluded community-dwelling older adults aged ≥55 years and of lower SES. Older adults awaiting participation in the program served as controls. Older adults under the intervention were equipped with a smartphone and cellular data, underwent fortnightly to monthly digital literacy training with volunteers to learn digital skills, and digitally connected to their existing social networks. Primary outcome was the improvement in self-reported digital literacy. Secondary outcomes included improvements in University of California, Los Angeles 3-item loneliness scale, Lubben Social Network Scale-6, EQ-5D-3L and EQ visual analogue scale scores, and Personal Wellbeing Score. Results: There were significant improvements in digital literacy scores in the intervention group as compared to controls (mean difference 2.28, 95% CI 1.37-3.20; P < .001). Through multiple linear regression analyses, this difference in digital literacy scores remained independently associated with group membership after adjusting for differences in baseline scores, age, gender, education, living arrangement, housing type, and baseline social connectivity and loneliness status. There was no statistically significant difference in University of California, Los Angeles 3-item loneliness scale, Lubben Social Network Scale-6, Personal Wellbeing Score, or EQ-5D Utility and visual analogue scale score. Conclusions: This study adds to the growing research on digital inclusion by showing that a volunteer-led, one-on-one, and home-based digital literacy program contributed to increase digital literacy in older adults of low SES. Future studies should look into developing more older adult-friendly digital spaces and technology design to encourage continued digital adoption in older adults and, eventually, impact health-related outcomes.},

The well-known unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) is applied and extended to study citizens' behavior regarding e-government services. A quantitative technique was utilized to gauge the efficiency of the model. Overall, 371 replies were received through distributing samples. SPSS software was used for the data evaluation. Two extra constructs were introduced in the study, i.e., “Trust of system (TOS)” and “Ethics of Internet (EOI)”, into the original UTAUT as the theoretical extension. The findings indicate that all constructs have a significant influence on the intention to use e-government services. Moreover, the EOI moderates the effects of TOS on social impacts (SI), performance expectancy (PE), and behavior intention (BI). The results also indicated that there were statistically significant differences in the demographic characteristics of age, educational level excluding gender, and behavioral intention to use e-government services. The study's results support most of the hypotheses. The results contribute to a better knowledge of the factors affecting the sustainable adoption of e-government in northern Iraq.},

The primary aim of this article is to investigate the impact of media on political activism and the empowerment of youth within the Indian democratic context. It seeks to explore how various media platforms, including digital and social media, contribute to shaping political opinions and facilitating civic engagement among India's younger population. This article delves into the multifaceted role of media in shaping India's democratic landscape, with a specific focus on its impact on political discourse, citizen engagement, and youth empowerment. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature and empirical evidence, the article explores the challenges posed by the spread of misinformation, regulatory constraints, and digital inequalities, while also highlighting the opportunities presented by citizen journalism initiatives, alternative media outlets, and social media platforms. By equipping citizens, especially the youth, with critical media literacy skills and promoting digital citizenship, India can navigate the complexities of media democratization to foster a more inclusive, participatory, and resilient democracy. Through this analysis, the article contributes to a deeper understanding of the intricate interplay between media, politics, and youth empowerment in the context of India's evolving democratic landscape. The future of Indian democracy will significantly depend on how well the nation manages to harness the potential of media platforms to foster informed political participation while mitigating the risks associated with digital media proliferation. As this article illustrates, nurturing a resilient and inclusive democratic process is contingent upon empowering the youth with the tools to critically engage with media and actively participate in the democratic governance of their country.},

A technology adoption model is synthesized based on study of existent literature, and further empirically tested using field data from primary surveys in four Indian cities using suitable sampling strategy. In fulfilling the objectives, the approach also included capturing citizens' responses on awareness about online services, usage and satisfaction with select services for different modes, and perception of the e-government services to understand citizens' perspectives on e-government adoption. The primary finding of the study identifies drivers and barriers for adoption in a context of developing country. The study is limited to four cities in India. Technology adoption models require separate testing in different cultural contexts. The study findings have immense relevance for policy makers and implementers to strategize mechanisms of increasing the usage of e governance thereby making urban governance efficient and transparent. The research has its conceptual base in the theory of planned behavior and technology adoption model to derive a theoretical framework for e government adoption. The proposed technology adoption model introduces preference as a critical factor influencing e-government adoption in contrast to other previously known models.},

While various global initiatives, like Singapore's Silver Infocomm Initiative and the European Commission's Digital Skills and Jobs Coalition, strive to foster digital literacy across generations, family plays a central role in intergenerational learning. The significance of formal education in equipping digital natives is underscored, suggesting an integration of digital literacy into curricula and innovative teaching methods. The chapter scrutinizes the influence of societal norms and policies on technology acceptance and utilization. Upcoming trends, including the growing digital participation of the elderly and breakthroughs in VR, AR, MR, AI, and IoT, are discussed. However, potential pitfalls like widening digital disparities in marginalized communities and issues of privacy and ethics are acknowledged. The chapter concludes with insights into the present landscape of intergenerational digital communication, stressing the imperative of continuous efforts, through education, policy, and community engagement, to make technology a tool for empowerment and inclusivity.},

abstract = {Purpose: The paper explores the main drivers of the regional-level digital divide in Ecuadorian cities and the extent to which the information and communication technology (ICT) adoption by citizens influences local-level policymakers' decisions to develop eGovernment services. Design/methodology/approach: The paper used an exploratory approach. The authors empirically assessed the provision of eGovernment services in each of the 36 Ecuadorian local governments following the Local Online Service Index (LOSI) measurement scale proposed by the United Nations, and then evaluated the drivers of the eGovernment divide at a local level. Ordinary least squares regression analysis was used. Findings: The findings indicate that the digital divide is driven by income and education disparities, and that eGovernment availability is driven by ICT use. It appears that proper attention to technology use by its citizens is not being given by local-level policymakers in Ecuador when they devise their eGovernment strategy. Research limitations/implications: Because the data were available at different levels of aggregation, there may be some inaccuracy of the indicators and lack of generalizability. Researchers are encouraged to test this hypotheses with data at lower levels of aggregation and from different latitudes to provide a comparative view between countries. Practical implications: The paper includes implications for policymakers and local authorities regarding how the limitations on eGovernment development may be mitigated. Originality/value: This study fulfils the need to assess digital development and its impact on eGovernment services at a city level in a developing country.},

abstract = {The digital divide in Europe has not yet been bridged and thus more contributions towards understanding the factors affecting the different dimensions involved are required. This research offers some insights into the topic by analyzing the e-Government adoption or practical use of e-Government across Europe (26 EU countries). Based on the data provided by the statistical office of the European Union (Eurostat), we defined two indexes, the E-Government Use Index (EGUI) and an extreme version of it taking into account only null or complete use (EGUI+), and characterized the use/non use of e-Government tools using supervised learning procedures in a selection of countries with different e-Government adoption levels. These procedures achieved an average accuracy of 73% and determined the main factors related to the practical use of e-Government in each of the countries, e.g. the frequency of buying goods over the Internet or the education level. In addition, we compared the proposed indexes to other indexes measuring the level of e-readiness of a country such as the E-Government Development Index (EGDI) its Online Service Index (OSI) component, the Networked Readiness Index (NRI) and its Government usage component (GU). The ranking comparison found that EGUI+ is correlated with the four indexes mentioned at 0.05 significance level, as the majority of countries were ranked in similar positions. The outcomes contribute to gaining understanding about the factors influencing the use of e-Government in Europe and the different adoption levels.},

The paper uses a panel data of 15 MENA countries between 2003 and 2018. The paper examines, first, the effect of e-government on good governance. Second, it highlights the effect of good governance on sustainable development, and third, it assesses the effect of e-government development on sustainable development, i.e., the digital dividends. The race is between skills and technology, while the outcome will settle on whether the dividends from digital technologies are realized and the benefits widely shared. The results reveal that most indicators of good governance have a positive contribution to sustainable development. As for the impact of e-government development on governance indicators, findings show that digitalization improves control of corruption and government effectiveness, and to a lesser extent, regulatory quality. Contrary to what was expected, e-government-related variables exert an adverse effect on various aspects of sustainable development instead of being a catalyst for progress. Based on these findings, the paper provides some recommendations. Essentially, policies on the use of digital technologies need to be adequately embedded in public sector reform. MENA countries should promote competitive business environments, enhance accountability, and upgrade education and skills development systems. Our findings are then of great interest to policymakers to make the necessary reforms that reap digital dividends in the form of faster growth, better public services, and adequate environmental management.},

Nevertheless, the high financial cost involved in infrastructure maintenance, the substantial size of the informal economies, and various governance challenges are curtailing government idealism regarding smart cities. This review examines the state of smart city development in developing countries, which includes understanding the conceptualisations, motivations, and unique drivers behind (and barriers to) smarty city development. A total of 56 studies were identified from a systematic literature review from an initial pool of 3928 social sciences literature identified from two academic databases. Data were analysed using thematic synthesis and thematic analysis. The review found that technology-enabled smart cities in developing countries can only be realised when concurrent socioeconomic, human, legal, and regulatory reforms are instituted. Governments need to step up their efforts to fulfil the basic infrastructure needs of citizens, raise more revenue, construct clear regulatory frameworks to mitigate the technological risks involved, develop human capital, ensure digital inclusivity, and promote environmental sustainability. A supportive ecosystem that encourages citizen participation, nurtures start-ups, and promotes public-private partnerships needs to be created to realise their smart city vision.},

The seven elements of Scheyvens and Biddulph's (2018) conceptual framework for inclusive tourism development form an appropriate and useful tool upon which to examine the current state of accessible tourism. The application of this framework reveals that we still have some way to go. We conclude this paper with a future agenda that posits attention to all seven elements of the inclusive tourism framework for accessible tourism, notably, to increase the involvement of people with disabilities as tourism producers and consumers; increase their self-representation and participation in decision-making; transform power relations; reimagine tourism places and people; and break down social barriers. We especially urge researchers to examine the dominant ableist discourse, to consider how our inquiry can be more participatory and inclusive, and to seek to bridge inquiry, industry and community.},

abstract = {Governments have increased their collaboration with the private sector regarding public service delivery, and their propensities to do so are largely shaped by their own in-house capacities. In this article, we theorize and analyze whether governments with an extremely low or extremely high technological capacity are more likely to collaborate with third-party platforms in order to jointly provide digital services. We expect there to be a U-shaped relationship between the technological capacity of those governments and their public–private partnership choices. An empirical analysis of digital service delivery across 290 prefecture-level cities in China corroborates this hypothesis. These results deepen our understanding of the competing motivations that drive the public–private partnership process. Points for practitioners: Public–private collaboration has been widely adopted to promote digital service delivery. This article confirms the U-shaped relationship between government technological capacity and public–private collaboration in digital service delivery at the city level. To encourage the collaboration, it is crucial to target governments with varying capacities, which seems to be easier in large cities with high administrative rank and that are overall technologically mature and in a competitive environment technologically.},

abstract = {The notion of holistic governance was originally proposed to make up for the fragmentation of public service provision. However, such a notion also has a great potential to be transferred and understood in the digital government context in China, where there is an increasing need to reshape the landscape of government–enterprise relationships that can enable enterprises to involvement effectively in holistic governance, or the planning and design of public services. However, previous empirical studies on holistic governance have neglected the question of how to make this happen. The aim of this article is to fill these gaps, building on holistic governance theory, this article offers a theoretical framework for government–enterprise relationships under the holistic governance paradigm. The framework identifies a comprehensive set of relationships that explain how these relationships affect enterprises' participation in public service provision. The empirical analysis is based on case studies of four e-services cooperation programs in China. We report three main findings. First, economic incentive should be developed in combination with a holistic governance strategy in order to encourage policymakers to reshape government–enterprise relationships. Second, it seems that the implementation of holistic governance is more effective when complemented with a managerial strategy in relation to organizational transformation. Finally, trust-building between governments and enterprises plays a pivotal role in nurturing the holistic governance paradigm. These findings have important policy implications for efforts to promote enterprise participation and cross-sector solutions to fragmented public service provision.},

Using a quantitative cross-sectional research design, data were collected from 242 stakeholders in Pakistan, including government officials, beneficiaries of e-governance initiatives, and IT professionals. Structured questionnaires were employed to measure e-governance implementation, poverty reduction, social welfare improvements, public service efficiency, and digital literacy. SPSS and AMOS were used to analyze the collected data. The data were analyzed using Descriptive statistics, correlation, regression, and mediation-moderation techniques. Findings reveal that e-governance significantly influences poverty reduction ($\beta$ = 0.38, p < 0.001) and social welfare improvements, mediated by public service efficiency ($\beta$ = 0.22, p < 0.001). Digital literacy and accessibility moderate this relationship, with higher digital skills enhancing e-governance outcomes ($\beta$ = 0.60, p < 0.001). The study underscores the importance of digital inclusion and efficient public service delivery in maximizing the socio-economic benefits of e-governance. These results provide valuable insights for policymakers to design inclusive digital governance frameworks, emphasizing investments in digital infrastructure and literacy programs to achieve sustainable development goals.</p>},

This study aims to discover the barriers, and the roles of government, for digital transformation in small service business. This study applied a qualitative approach involving semi-structured in-depth interviews with top management of small service business. Then, we em-ployed the content analysis method to examine interview data and construct a model. This research reveals four main barriers to digital transformation in small service business: lack of funding, lack of digital capability, lack of human resources, and technical barriers. We found there are four government roles for supporting digital transformation in small service business: build a digital platform for small service business, promote mobile/digital payment, provide digital training, and build a digital collaboration ecosystem. Additionally, based on this study's findings, a model for barriers and government support of digital transformation in small service business is presented. This study contributes to the conceptual framework and management implications in the digital transformation field.

In this research, we employed a case study approach to investigate and analyze DT based on relevant events occurring in a five-year period. A conceptual model was created by combining the diamond framework, the technology enactment framework, and enterprise architecture scope to facilitate the chronological analysis of these events and reflect upon the creation of flexibility. The findings indicate that DT in government spreads in waves with adaptations in different organizational elements, impacting the whole administrative system from the provincial level to the country level and including both radical and incremental changes. Flexibility increases alongside progress in DT and can be technology-enabled or policy-enabled. The creation of flexibility also depends on organizational elements and bureaucratic levels.

abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to investigate the correlation between public trust and the performance of collaborative e-governance, with a particular emphasis on trust in government institutions as the central aspect of inquiry. It assesses how public trust influences e-governance performance through the lens of good governance principles, encompassing evaluations of trust in government services and trust in the technological infrastructure used for citizen services. Design/methodology/approach: The research framework is based on a thorough literature review, pilot study and practical experience. An empirical survey was conducted using a structured questionnaire to collect primary data from individuals who have used specific e-governance projects. To conduct the survey, the author used the snowball sampling method both offline and online. The author analysed the data using SmartPLS Version 3 to assess the measurement and structural model. Findings: The study rigorously examines and confirms all formulated hypotheses using robust statistical analyses. Nonetheless, the results underscore the pivotal significance of the reliability and utility of e-governance services in nurturing public trust. Furthermore, the research unveils a troubling concern pertaining to the absence of tailored responses to citizen inquiries, grievances and recommendations, indicating an area of vulnerability in the effort to cultivate public trust. Research limitations/implications: The research has implications for managers, citizens and researchers. It focuses on public trust in interaction-based collaboration, but researchers may extend it to other forms like content-based collaboration. Policymakers can implement the findings in present and future e-governance projects. Limitations include a moderate sample size, country context, and not assessing other factors that may influence public trust in collaborative e-governance performance. Originality/value: This study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by exploring the link between good governance, public trust and collaborative e-governance performance. It focuses on projects that require physical visits to government offices, where public trust has been impacted. This study is unique because it assesses public trust in collaborative e-governance, specifically in the context of India, where there is limited prior research on this topic exists.},

Design/methodology/approach: This study uses binomial logistic regression modeling on two data sets: a nationwide survey at the individual level of 8,854 usable samples conducted in 2019 and village potential statistics. Findings: The survey indicates low adoption and use of e-government services among both males and females. The statistical analysis further reveals that although there might be some variations in the influencing factors between the genders, the overall patterns are similar. These findings suggest that the low adoption and use of e-government services among males and females can be attributed to factors such as misperceptions about internet-based services, resulting in low motivation to use the services, inadequate internet connectivity, affordability, limited digital skills and exposure to harmful online content. Originality/value: This study conducts a gender-disaggregated analysis to determine whether the antecedents of males' decisions to adopt e-government services differ from those of females.

abstract = {The purpose of the paper is to analyse the relationship between digitalisation of public services (e-government) and ESG factors (environmental, social and economic factors). As public administration is a major stakeholder influencing sustainable development and state governments are aiming to digitise their services, there is a need to better understand the effect of the digital revolution on ESG. This article aims to study the relationship between the E-Government Development Index (EGDI) and ESG factors in 26 European countries. The linear ordering method TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) was used for the study, followed by the Perkal index and the method of optimal predictors' selection—the Hellwig method. The study is based on the Eurostat data (in the period 2003–2020), and the analysis includes ten variables: Share of environmental taxes in GDP; Exposure to dust air pollution; Greenhouse gas emissions by source sector—carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, etc. (energy, industry, agriculture, forestry, waste management) (thousands of tonnes); Passenger transport volume in relation to GDP; At risk of poverty or social exclusion; Percentage of people satisfied with their financial situation among people aged 16+; Share of the ICT sector in GDP; Unemployment rate of people aged 20–64; Research and development expenditure in all sectors; GDP per capita. The in-depth analysis offers a matrix that represents the relationships between environmental taxes and the development of e-government. The main finding reveals statistically significant relationships between the EGDI and aggregate variables representing the environmental, social and economic spheres. It indicates a genuine, positive impact of digitalised administrative processes on sustainable development. It also seems to confirm that investments in digital infrastructure and government e-services bring multiple long-term benefits and contribute directly to all three domains relevant to the sustainability of modern development. The results of the analysis can be found useful by governments and governmental institutions as informing digitalisation strategies aimed at balancing the development of e-services and their support infrastructure. Nowadays, when planning strategic actions, one should take into account the social, economic and environmental impact of the digitalisation processes.},

E-government and digital-government tools have the potential to deliver significant savings and optimize the delivery of public services. Nevertheless, even in developed countries, there are still citizens who do not have equal access to digital technology or are not competent users. Filing taxes or applying for social welfare benefits online are far from obvious tasks for many citizens worldwide. The digitization-by-default of public services is currently leaving many individuals behind. As new digital divides emerge, digital inequality is not only reproducing longstanding socioeconomic inequalities but also placing itself as a standalone source of exclusion. While there is abundant humanities literature on the digital divide and digital citizenship, recent legal scholarship has overlooked the legal implications of the unequal access and usage of digital government. This exploratory paper discusses the legal implications of current policies and principles of digital government for the digital exclusion of citizens.

This research was conducted for the purpose of examining the effect of employees' resistance to change including resistance to modern technology, fear of loss of control, feelings of insecurity, fear of inability to implement change, and fear of workload increasing, on implementing an e-government system represented in performance dimensions (efficiency and effectiveness) in Egypt. This paper reflects the lack of research into resistance to change in the specific context of e-government implementation in Egypt. We surveyed 400 respondents in several public organizations in Egypt to investigate the impact of such resistance, in order to determine which behaviors can affect any of the implemented e-government dimensions. The study also determines the differences between employees' responses to implementing the new system depending on variables such as gender, age, educational level, job position, and level of experience. The results reveal that fear of loss of control and fear of workload increasing affect all dependent variables significantly, while feelings of insecurity does not affect efficiency significantly. Resistance to modern technology and a fear of inability to implement change do not have significant effects on the dependent variables.},

abstract = {Blockchain technology and its business applications have attracted considerable scholarly interest, leading to a surge in academic studies. While this wealth of research is beneficial, it also poses challenges in identifying the most relevant publications. Despite the availability of survey articles, research on this topic remains fragmented and concentrates on specific industrial sectors. This review addresses this gap by providing a detailed literature analysis, highlighting key themes, recent advancements, the benefits of blockchain adoption for businesses, and associated challenges. This study employs a multi-method literature review approach called bibliometric systematic literature review (B-SLR), combining bibliometric analysis with systematic literature review (SLR) techniques. This review critically examines studies of blockchain adoption in modern business from 2017 to 2023. Our findings reveal a decline in academic publications on blockchain for businesses since 2023, along with a shift in core themes from traditional supply chains to exploring blockchain's role in environmentally sustainable supply chains, such as reverse logistics, green supply chains, and the circular economy. Additionally, there is an emerging focus on the role of blockchain in virtual environments, such as the metaverse and digital twins. Drawing from our analysis, we also present a theoretical framework and highlight ten crucial areas for future research.},

The overall purpose of this study is to identify why digital transformations in the public sector of developing country contexts fail. This paper reports on a rich revelatory case study of a Sri Lankan government agency that experienced digital transformation failure. Data was collected primarily via semi-structured interviews and augmented with document analysis that enabled us to derive deep insights into why digital transformations fail. We identified 23 failure factors which were grouped into 5 meta-themes, namely, Organisational, Implementing Agency, Cultural, Leadership and Macro-Level Factors, forming a failure factor model. The analysis also unveiled complex interrelationships between these themes/factors, which formed the basis for 6 evidence-supported propositions detailed in the paper. The findings will benefit public sector organizations in developing countries and their implementation partners to effectively plan their digital transformation strategies.},

abstract = {<p>The digital transformation within public administration is fundamental to improving government effectiveness levels. The study employs CS-ARDL analysis to evaluate the relationship between e-government development and governance indicators (control of corruption, e-government, rule of law, regulatory quality, and voice and accountability) concerning Government Effectiveness in the short and long term. According to the study findings, control of corruption, regulatory quality, and citizen participation demonstrate short-run effects on Government Effectiveness. The combination of quick expansions in the rule of law regulations and previous government efficiency creates obstacles to present-day administrative success, indicating potential administrative flexibility problems. Sustainable improvements in government effectiveness emerge from robust control of corruption combined with high regulatory quality, active voice, and accountability during the long-run analysis. Combining e-government platforms with strict regulations shows inverse relationships to sustainable effectiveness because proper institutional backing and supplementary reform measures are essential for digital tools to produce intended benefits. The findings demonstrate the need for government officials to unite digital initiatives with extensive institutional capacity development because this combination enables e-government programs to create better public service provision and governance outcomes.</p>},

abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to examine the role of trust and digital literacy in influencing citizens' adoption of e-government services. Design/methodology/approach: Grounded in the technology acceptance model (TAM), a research model was developed focusing on e-filing services adoption. Hypotheses were formulated to assess the moderating effect of digital literacy on the relationship between trust and the key TAM determinants of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. A questionnaire-based survey of 876 citizens who have used e-filing using the snow-ball sampling technique was adopted to generate data. The data was analyzed using PLS-SEM through the aid of SmartPLS 4 to assess the measurement model and structural relationships. Findings: Trust positively influences perceived usefulness and ease of use, which in turn drive adoption. Additionally, digital literacy significantly moderates the impact of trust on usefulness and ease of use perceptions – the effect is stronger for higher digital literacy. Research limitations/implications: The study adopted a single country developing economy context limiting cross-cultural applicability. Second, the focus on e-filing adoption precludes insights across other e-government services. Third, the reliance on perceptual measures risks respondent biases and fourth, the study is a cross-sectional survey design. Practical implications: The findings emphasize multifaceted strategies to accelerate e-government adoption. Nurturing citizen trust in e-government systems through enhanced reliability, security and transparency remains vital. Simultaneously, initiatives to cultivate digital access, skills and proficiencies across population segments need to be undertaken. Originality/value: This study integrates trust and digital literacy within the theoretical model to provide a more holistic understanding of adoption determinants. It highlights the need for balanced technology-enabled and social interventions to foster acceptance of e-government services.},

The two are broadly distinct in their characteristics of implementation due to differences in the diffusion and speed of technology patterns combined with efforts to bridge the digital divide. This leads to the objective of this paper, understanding the dynamic effects intertwining diverse aspects-social, technical, and socio-technical-on the development of e-government. However, current research still lacks a holistic perspective in comprehending how social, technical and socio-technical dimensions interact or promote the development of e-government system in a given state. This paper uses a panel dataset gathered from the World Bank, UN, and ITU databases. The research results highlight the need to look at the development of e-government through a more holistic approach rather than an atomistic single-cause approach. The results also indicate that there is no one-size-fits-all solution and a more effective e-government master plan should take into consideration the technical side of e-government development and also reflect social and, most importantly, socio-technical considerations and its holistic implication for the development of e-government systems in a given state.},

ICTs are commonly used by governments to collaborate and communicate with stakeholders. Yet, the use of ICTs increases local governments exposure to cyberthreats. Cyberthreats are increasing and local governments are often under-resourced and underprepared for them. While many organizations combat cyberthreats with technological solutions, it is well known that social aspects—including manager vigilance and buy-in—are critical in reducing cyber incidents. Thus, governments require both social and technical solutions to cyberthreats. This research takes a sociotechnical perspective to examine the relationships between social (e.g., values and perceptions) and technical factors (e.g., design and capacity) and cyber incidents in local government. We use data from a 2018 national survey of public managers in 500 U.S. cities, data from city government websites, and the U.S. Census. The results indicate that manager buy-in and perceptions interact with technical aspects to explain reported cyber incidents in government.

Nonetheless, the country faces challenges such as evolving cyber threats. The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors influencing cybersecurity practices to ensure the reliability and security of e-government services. Design/methodology/approach: This paper investigates the multifaceted dynamics of cybersecurity practices and their impact on the quality and effectiveness of e-government services. Five key factors explored include organizational culture, technology infrastructure, adherence to standards and regulations, employee training and awareness and financial investment in cybersecurity. This study used a quantitative method to gather data from 320 participants. The researcher collected 285 completed questionnaires, excluding unusable or incomplete responses, and analyzed the final data set using partial least squares structural equation modeling. Findings: The findings show that financial investment in cybersecurity, employee training and awareness and adherence to cybersecurity regulations significantly influence the adoption of robust cybersecurity practices. However, the relationship between organizational culture and cybersecurity practices is less straightforward.

Existing international research on the implementation of broadband has studied its adoption patterns with a focus on the rural/urban digital divide. This paper explores the digital divide in a case study of the seventh largest city, by population, in the United States; San Antonio is a majority-minority city where over half of the people are Hispanic. This paper focuses on the five key affordability factors that drive broadband adoption. Researchers test social exclusion theory, the structural facets of poverty and social marginality to ascertain its potential impact on broadband access. The authors conducted a survey in both English and Spanish to learn more about the affordability factors that influence the broadband digital divide. Through our analysis, we found evidence that four of the factors (geographical disparities, profit-based discrimination, technology deployment cost, and socio-economic factors) played a role in the digital divide in this case study. The results of this study demonstrate that the digital divide is not exclusively a rural/urban digital divide, but can also occur in an intra-city context. This is especially evident in low-income areas within the city because they have substantially lower broadband adoption rates. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of looking closely at issues of social exclusion of marginalized groups and the affordability of broadband access intra-city.},

abstract = {The “transformation of government” has often been proposed as an objective of e-government; frequently presented as a phase in stage models following the provision online of information and transactions. Yet in literature or official documents there is no established definition of transformation as applied to government. Implicitly or explicitly, it mostly refers to a change in organisational form, signalled by the terms “joining-up” or “integration”, of government. In some work, transformation is limited to changing processes or “services” — though “services” is a term unhelpfully applied to a multitude of entities.   There is in academic or other literature little evidence of any type of “transformation” achieved beyond a change in an administrative process, nor a robust framework of benefits one might deliver. This begs the questions of what it actually means in reality and why it might be a desired goal.   In essence, what we aim to do in this paper is to develop a structured frame of reference for making sense of how information and communications technologies (ICT), in all their forms, really fit within the world of government and public administration.  After a brief historical review, the paper starts by considering what governments and public administrations actually do: specifically, policy design and implementation through policy instruments. It redefines transformation in terms of changing the policy instrument set chosen to implement policy and sets out broad rationales for how and why ICT can enable this. It proposes a frame of reference of terminology, concepts and objects that enable the examination of not only such transformation, but e-government in general as it has developed over two decades.  This last is done, with suggestions on several areas where more research or development of the detail is required. In an annex, there are tabulations of the components of policy design, types of policy instrument, and potential aspects of instrument selection, tuning and administration that might be enhanced through using ICT or data.   Our way of viewing the issues supports a review of past e-government practice and research, which critiques the predominant approaches that are based on flawed models of government as a service industry and thus have stymied progress. The paper points to ways forward for practice and further research. It draws mainly on UK illustrations with which we are familiar, but its principles are applicable across most nations.},

abstract = {As the Internet, and broadband in particular, becomes a platform for social and political engagement, researchers investigate more carefully both the factors that drive broadband adoption and the barriers that constrain it. This paper reports on one of the only large‐scale qualitative studies of the barriers to broadband adoption in the United States, where 30% of the population lack broadband access. The primary research question asks: how can we qualitatively understand barriers to broadband adoption among low‐income communities? The study's community‐based approach, undertaken in four regions of the country, reveals the complex equilibrium of broadband adoption. Drawing from 170 interviews with broadband non‐adopters as well as community access providers and other intermediaries, this study finds that price is only one factor shaping home broadband adoption, and that libraries and other community organizations fill the gap between low home adoption and high demand for broadband. These intermediaries compensate for shortages in digital skills that also constitute barriers to adoption in a context where broadband is essential for gaining access to jobs, education, and e‐government. These three main findings suggest that low‐income people like our research participants are playing roles as actors in an ecology of broadband access games (Dutton et al. 2004). In particular, they are overcoming barriers to being online in order to participate in accessing services and gaining education. This is part of the process of defining broadband as an infrastructure for e‐democracy. The paper recommends a renewed focus on factors that sustain home access rather than drive demand, as well as support for community intermediaries in provisioning public broadband access within a context of skill shortages. It recommends further qualitative research to better understand the role of diverse populations in framing the value of broadband access.},

We analyse the difference in adoption of e-governance by younger and older Internet users as well as their reasons for not using e-government services (specifically by submitting completed forms to public authorities). Additionally, we seek to identify factors that determine the difference in the reluctance to adopt e-governance services by senior citizens and the young. By adopting Heckman selection methodology, we establish three categories of factors: those that have different effects for young and old (gender, household size, and population density), those having similar effects (economic activity), and those that have adverse effects for the young and the old (education). Based on empirical results, we suggest following venues for EU-wide policy actions: special attention should be given to older population in sparsely populated areas, specialised learning activities should be developed for older citizens with additional effort to promote inclusion of older women to participate in these learning activities.},

abstract = {Understanding and using ICT is critical for increasing effectiveness of the public sector, improving access to public services, enhancing transparency and engagement of various stakeholders in public decision-making processes. At the same time, utilization of new emerging technologies such as cloud computing, big data analytics, open data, social media, or Internet of Things has become more commonplace in recent years. This study aims to understand what determines ICT disparities and digital divides in the context of new technologies and digital world shifts. For this purpose, a theoretical framework of ICT-related indicators elucidating differences between the traditional and new approach is proposed. These ICT indicators were identified through the decomposition of related ICT and e-government indices together with explanatory factors derived from the literature. The European Union Member States were chosen as a sample for the exploratory analysis because of the availability of relevant indicators. More specifically, correlation, factor, regression, and cluster analyses were employed as empirical strategies to carry out this study. The Human Development Index together with research and development expenditure are the most important explanatory factors for the new approach, while the traditional set of indicators is still mostly correlated with the gross domestic product per capita. Finally, five clusters of Member States were identified and their implications for improving the use of ICT in the public sector are described.},

abstract = {This article builds on existing literature on digital inequality and the digitised welfare state to elucidate one underexplored way in which the rise of e-government platforms further disadvantages already-marginalised people: by requiring that they possess a verifiable digital footprint distributed across multiple public and commercial platforms. We illustrate the pertinence and nuances of this particular risk through lived experience research in a UK public library where limited users receive help with digital skills. Although there is a growing recognition of both the inevitability of digital welfare and the risks to marginalised communities, little work has been done to connect these abstract policy discussions to lived experience—to pinpoint how digitisation creates these exclusions, beyond simply having internet access or not. This article argues that the prerequisite of a digital footprint engenders a double disadvantage: (1) lacking a digital footprint is the result of barriers that are largely invisible to data-driven, digital-by-default systems, and (2) when marginalised users establish a sufficient footprint, this entails a disproportionately onerous responsibility for managing a distributed personal data trail in the long term. This combination of mundane barriers and the burden of responsibility for a digital identity points to policy implications for governments aiming to advance inclusive digital transformation agendas.},

We then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start thematic analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis.

Against this background, this article introduces a framework for exploring the different dimensions of digital innovation in the public sector at the urban scale. It proposes conceptual categories that capture digital transformation drivers and mechanisms, encouraging reflections about their capacity to resonate in specific (urban) contexts. After examining frameworks seeking to deconstruct digital transformation in its multiple dimensions, the study proposes a conceptual model and validates it against the result of the literature review. By identifying conceptual categories and their interactions, the study seeks to support a more comprehensive understanding of transformation processes, specifically focusing on public service provision and delivery and their relationship with endogenous and exogenous innovation drivers. At the same time, the study aims to support local public authorities in gaining awareness of their transformative potential and helping them “steer” local digital transformation dynamics.},

Hence, the goal of this study is to examine the various factors that influence the use of SANAD App As a health protection tool. The factors were adopted from well-established models like UTAUT, TAM, and extended PBT. Using survey data from 442 SANAD App from Jordan, the model was empirically validated using AMOS 20 confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation modeling (SEM) and machine learning (ML) methods were performed to assess the study hypotheses. The ML methods used are ANN, SMO, the bagging reduced error pruning tree (RepTree), and random forest. The results suggested several key findings: the respondents' performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, perceived risk, trust, and perceived service quality of this digital technology were significant antecedents for their attitude to using it. The strength of these relationships is affected by the moderating variables, including age, gender, educational level, and internet experience on behavioral intention. Yet, perceived risk did not have a significant effect on attitude towards SANAD App The study adds to literature by empirically testing and theorizing the effects of SANAD App on public health protection.},

An electronic search was conducted on Web of Science, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore databases, and after a screening procedure considering predefined eligibility criteria, 34 studies were reviewed. These studies performed user-centered usability evaluation of digital applications related to (i) participatory reporting of urban issues, (ii) environmental sustainability, (iii) civic participation, (iv) urban planning, (v) promotion of democratic values, (vi) electronic voting, and (vii) chatbots. In terms of the methodological quality of the included studies, the results suggest that there is a high heterogeneity of the user-centered usability evaluation. Therefore, there is a need for recommendations to support user-centered usability evaluations of digital applications to promote citizens' engagement and participation in public governance to improve the planning and conduction of future research.},

Many governments around the globe are investing heavily in IT to enhance service delivery to their citizens. However, citizens do not always use these services so that they often forgo their potential benefits because of key interconnected considerations that are perceived to transpire from their use. Over the years several studies examined IT adoption in e-government services contexts, building a rich albeit fragmented body of knowledge in the process. Indeed, the diversity found in these studies and the fast and continuous change that characterizes IT in general, make the identification and the synthesis of the main factors influencing citizens' adoption of E-government services a relevant and timely endeavor. For this reason, this study builds on the findings of a systematic literature review to provide a high-level framework that conceptually structures the state of knowledge on the topic, and that informs both researchers and practitioners on the main factors influencing e-government services adoption by citizens.},

The reason more for taking the e-Inclusion of all social groups as a challenge has recently been the Covid-19 pandemic and natural disasters (earthquakes, floods) that change the norms of social behavior, require adaptation and create new rules. Users' ability to use digital services and goods as well as open data provided by public and private organizations which ultimately results in greater access to relevant information as well as improved quality of life and are a key factor for the effectiveness of digital transformation and the economic justification of investing in advanced digital technologies, goods and services. The digital divide manifests itself on certain social groups, which is a social problem. However, despite these initiatives, there are still limitations that prevent certain population groups from becoming e-inclusive members of the information society. This paper presents an overview of the analysis results of the research perspective in which scientific and professional papers consider the concepts of e-Inclusion and digital divide as a challenge. The multiperspectiveness and multidimensionality of the concept of e-Inclusion indicates its significant role in the development of the information society.},

However, the success of eGovernment is best measured by the perceptions of citizens who use the services. This paper, the second of a two-part study seeks to investigate the types of public value that are desired as outcomes of eGovernment as well as the salient factors that are significant in predicting value creation from the perspective of citizens. To fulfil its objectives, the study adopts a theoretical model that integrates two streams of research: (i) the updated DeLone and McLean IS Success Model and (ii) Public Value. Using survey data collected from Nigeria, the model is empirically tested and validated through structural equation modelling analysis. Findings identify democracy, reflexivity and productivity in order of importance, as the three distinct value types desired as outcomes by citizens. Furthermore, results show service quality as the most salient factor significant in predicting citizen satisfaction and citizen trust in eGovernment, while both service quality and citizen satisfaction are significant in predicting net benefits. This research has both theoretical and practical implications. First, it contributes to the advancement of knowledge in the public value creation of eGovernment. Second, it provides a practical reference point for improving service delivery in the public sector.},

Through a comprehensive analysis of peer-reviewed articles, policy documents, and case studies, the research explores the interplay between institutional capacity, socio-cultural factors, and the digital divide in shaping e-government outcomes across urban and rural contexts in countries including Ghana, South Africa, Kenya, India, Nigeria, Brazil, and Indonesia. Following a rigorous search strategy and inclusion criteria, the review synthesizes findings from multiple sources, highlighting significant advancements in e-government adoption, particularly in urban areas, while identifying persistent challenges in rural regions due to inadequate infrastructure, limited digital literacy, and resource constraints. The systematic review of literature underscores the potential of e-government to enhance transparency, reduce corruption, and improve service delivery, as exemplified through successful initiatives in countries like Rwanda and Estonia. However, the synthesized evidence also reveals uneven progress, exacerbated through the urban-rural digital divide and varying institutional capacities. Systematically analyzing and integrating existing research, this review concludes with evidence-based recommendations for bridging these gaps, emphasizing the need for targeted infrastructure development, digital literacy programs, inclusive design approaches, and context-specific solutions to ensure equitable access to e-government services and accelerate progress towards effective, accountable, and transparent institutions at all levels.},

@article{Pedersen2018,
abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate how to analyse the possibilities for e-government transformations in public sector organisations and how these possibilities can be improved. Design/methodology/approach: The research constructs a model based on a literature review that focusses on the pressure that drives transformations, on the challenges transformations face and on the abilities needed for overcoming these challenges. The resulting model is subsequently used to analyse a successful case and to identify the keys to success in terms of the strategies used to transform. Findings: The possibilities for transformation depend on the organisational and contextual configuration (a public sector organisation and the context it operates in) which is more or less supportive of transformations. The configuration can be characterized by the pressure to transform, the challenges that must be overcome and the abilities to do so. There are some basic conditions that impact the possibilities for making the configuration more supportive of transformations: the interest of powerful stakeholders, the degree of publicness, the possibilities for changing the configuration are path dependent and the factors that matter for the possibilities for transformation are interrelated and might be governed by different authorities which make it difficult to manage and change them. When improving the possibilities for transformation in a configuration, the pressure can be increased, transformations can be made easier to accomplish by reducing challenges and by providing more support and abilities might be developed to better overcome the challenges. Transformation is accomplished through an interplay between actions that improve and exploit the configuration. Research limitations/implications: The findings are based on a single case. Practical implications: The public sector should find the balance between making transformations easier and increasing capabilities. The lessons from this research suggest that a more balanced strategy focussing more on eliminating the contextual and organisational challenges that make these projects so complex and providing more support might be a better investment than just aiming to increase project level capabilities. Social implications: Just as practice might benefit from changing the balance between increasing project level capabilities and making transformation easier, e-government research might improve its relevance by changing the balance between suggesting new approaches and researching the basic conditions for the exploitation of IT in public sector organisations. While the essence of public sector organisations in some cases makes transformations very challenging, there are still factors that might be improved upon through research. Originality/value: Previous research has established knowledge about transformational challenges and solutions. Based on this knowledge this research constructs a model that can be used to systematically analyse the possibilities for success, and strategies for dealing with these challenges are suggested.},
